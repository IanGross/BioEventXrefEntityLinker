The <termsem="EG:324053"> Zebrafish moonshine </term> Gene Encodes <termsem="EG:324053"> Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1 </term> , an Essential Regulator of Hematopoiesis .
Hematopoiesis is precisely orchestrated by lineage-specific DNA-binding proteins that regulate transcription in concert with coactivators and corepressors .
Mutations in the <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish moonshine </term> ( <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> ) gene specifically disrupt both embryonic and adult hematopoiesis , resulting in severe red blood cell aplasia .
We report that <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> encodes the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian transcriptional intermediary factor 1 ( TIF1 ) ( or TRIM33 ) , a member of the TIF1 family of coactivators and corepressors .
During development , hematopoietic progenitor cells in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants fail to express normal levels of hematopoietic transcription factors , including <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> , and undergo apoptosis .
Three different <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant alleles each encode premature stop codons , and enforced expression of wild-type <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> mRNA rescues embryonic hematopoiesis in homozygous <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants .
Surprisingly , a high level of zygotic <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> mRNA expression delineates ventral mesoderm during hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor formation prior to <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> expression .
Transplantation studies reveal that <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> functions in a cell-autonomous manner during the differentiation of erythroid precursors .
Studies in murine erythroid cell lines demonstrate that <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein is localized within novel nuclear foci , and expression decreases during erythroid cell maturation .
Our results establish a major role for this transcriptional intermediary factor in the differentiation of hematopoietic cells in vertebrates .
Hematopoiesis involves the coordinated processes of cell proliferation and differentiation of a relatively small number of progenitor cells into billions of circulating red and white blood cells ( Thisse and Zon 2002 ) .
Hematopoiesis in vertebrates , from zebrafish to humans , is an evolutionarily conserved program that produces two waves of stem or progenitor cells that differ both in their embryonic origins and in the lineages of differentiated blood cells produced ( Palis and Yoder 2001 ; Orkin and Zon 2002 ; Galloway and Zon 2003 ) .
The first , or primitive , wave of hematopoiesis originates from ventral mesoderm and gives rise to progenitor cells that differentiate in embryonic blood islands .
The primitive wave of hematopoiesis produces a burst of embryonic erythrocytes and macrophages .
The second , or definitive , wave of hematopoiesis arises from self-renewing stem cells that develop primarily in the intraembryonic aorta -- gonad -- mesonephros region .
These definitive hematopoietic stem cells seed the later developing marrow spaces , to produce all lineages of adult blood cells , including definitive erythrocytes , myeloid cells , and lymphocytes .
We have undertaken a genetic approach to characterize genes that control hematopoiesis using the zebrafish as a model system ( Thisse and Zon 2002 ) .
As part of a large-scale forward genetic screen , we previously identified bloodless zebrafish mutants that failed to express the erythroid transcription factor <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> normally in embryonic hematopoietic precursors ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) .
We named one of these zebrafish genes <termsem="EG:324053"> moonshine </term> ( <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> ) , and another group named a noncomplementing allele <termsem="EG:324053"> vampire </term> ( Weinstein et al. 1996 ) .
Here , we have determined that mutations in the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene cause a disruption in both primitive embryonic and definitive adult hematopoiesis , resulting in a severe loss of erythroid cells .
Erythroid progenitor cells in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants are initially present , but fail to express normal levels of hematopoietic transcription factors and undergo apoptosis .
Positional cloning identifies the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene as the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian transcriptional intermediary factor 1 ( TIF1 ) , a member of the TIF1 family of transcriptional coactivators and corepressors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Friedman et al. 1996 ; Kim et al. 1996 ; Venturini et al. 1999 ; Peng et al. 2002 ) .
The three members of the vertebrate TIF1 family (  ,  , and  ) are large nuclear proteins that each contain an N-terminal RBCC or TRIM domain ( Reymond et al. 2001 ) composed of a RING finger , two B-boxes , and a coiled-coil domain .
TIF1 family members also contain a C-terminal plant homeodomain finger and bromodomain that are characteristic of chromatin remodeling factors .
TIF1 has been shown to associate with a variety of ligand-bound nuclear hormone receptors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ) and function as a coactivator for retinoic acid receptors ( Zhong et al. 1999 ) .
TIF1 has been shown to act as a corepressor for the large family of Krppel-associated box ( KRAB ) domain zinc-finger transcription factors ( Friedman et al. 1996 ; Abrink et al. 2001 ) .
In contrast , TIF1 does not associate directly with either nuclear receptors or KRAB domains that bind to the other TIF1 family members ( Venturini et al. 1999 ; Abrink et al. 2001 ) .
Biochemical studies also demonstrate that TIF1 forms both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with TIF1 but not with TIF1 ( Peng et al. 2002 ) .
The murine Tif1 and Tif1 genes have not yet been subjected to gene targeting experiments , whereas analysis of mouse mutants demonstrates that <termsem="EG:21849"> Tif1 </term> is required for postimplantation embryogenesis and mesoderm induction in particular ( Cammas et al. 2000 ) .
Taken together , these studies suggest that a major function of TIF1 family members is to link DNA-binding proteins with other coactivators or corepressors during development .
Our studies establish that tif1 functions as an essential regulator of embryonic and adult hematopoiesis in vertebrates .
Cell transplantation studies demonstrate that <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> acts in a cell-autonomous manner during embryonic hematopoiesis .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> gene is expressed specifically in ventral mesoderm and hematopoietic progenitors , then downregulated as erythroid maturation occurs .
<termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein localizes to a novel class of nuclear bodies in both primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and erythroleukemia cell lines .
Taken together , our studies demonstrate that <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> is required for normal erythroid cell development and survival .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> Zebrafish mon </term> Gene Is Essential for Both Primitive and Definitive Erythropoiesis .
In order to determine when the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene is required in development , we first examined hematopoietic gene expression and apoptosis in zebrafish homozygous <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant embryos .
During embryogenesis , homozygous <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> mutants have no red blood cells ( RBCs ) visible in circulation ( Ransom et al. 1996 ; Weinstein et al. 1996 ) .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants initiate expression of <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> in hematopoietic cells around the five-somite stage , similar to wild-type embryos ( data not shown ) ; however , based on TUNEL staining , the differentiating erythroid cells undergo programmed cell death from the 12-somite stage to 22 h postfertilization ( hpf ) ( Figure 1A and 1B , arrows ) .
At 12 somites , <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> expression is only slightly reduced .
By 18 -- 22 hpf , hematopoietic-specific markers such as <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> , <termsem="EG:30766"> scl </term> , <termsem="EG:30480"> gata2 </term> , and <termsem="EG:30177"> ikaros </term> are not detected in the embryonic blood island ( Figure 1A and 1B ; unpublished data ) .
The hematopoietic cells are thus correctly specified early during the development of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant embryos , but these precursors undergo cell death .
Based on expression of <termsem="EG:30519"> c-myb </term> and <termsem="EG:30663"> rag1 </term> ( Figure 1B , arrows ) , <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants have normal myeloid and lymphoid development , respectively .
In addition to the deficit of RBCs in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants , there is a prominent loss of fin-fold and tail mesenchyme ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) .
TUNEL staining of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants demonstrates extensive apoptosis of mesenchymal cells in the trunk and tail bud regions ( Figure 1A and 1B , arrows ) .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene is thus required for normal development and survival of both committed erythroid progenitor cells and posterior mesenchymal cells .
We next examined definitive hematopoiesis in rare surviving homozygous adult <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> mutants .
Mutations in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> are generally lethal by 10 to 14 d of development ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) , although rare <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> homozygous mutants ( approximately 1 in 500 bloodless embryos ) of all tested alleles survive to adulthood .
Adult <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants show cardiac hypertrophy , presumably due to the severe anemia leading to a high output state ( Figure 2 ) .
In wild-type zebrafish , the adult site of hematopoiesis is the kidney ( Al Adhami and Kunz 1977 ) , which contains erythroid , lymphoid , and myeloid populations at various stages of differentiation ( Bennett et al. 2001 ) .
In <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> homozygous mutants , there is a severe block in maturation at the proerythroblast stage ( Figure 2 ) , whereas the differentiation of myeloid cells is normal ( unpublished data ) .
This demonstrates that the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene product acts during both primitive and definitive erythropoiesis .
Positional Cloning Identifies <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> as the Zebrafish Ortholog of Mammalian TIF1 .
We identified the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene by positional cloning using a panel of 2,200 diploid mutants collected from Tbingen background ( TU ) / WIK strain hybrid parents carrying the montg234 allele .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant gene was positioned on Chromosome 8 between microsatellite markers z987 and z11001 ( Figure 3A ) ( Knapik et al. 1998 ) .
For positional cloning purposes , over 12,000 polymorphic markers were screened using amplified fragment length polymorphism ( AFLP ) ( Ransom and Zon 1999 ) , and 36 markers within the interval were isolated .
One of these , MA3 , was found to be 0.3 cM from the gene ( Figure 3A ) and was utilized as the starting point of a chromosomal walk .
A critical P1 bacterial artificial chromosome clone ( PAC ) , 107N19 , was obtained that spanned the genetic interval .
Two simple sequence conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) markers found on this PAC clone flank the critical genetic interval .
The marker 80M12-T7 maps two recombinants out of 4,400 meioses telomeric of the mutation , and the marker 157J23-T7 maps one recombinant centromic of the mutation ( Figure 3A ) .
The end sequences and SSCP markers of PAC 107N19 are found in the zebrafish genomic sequence contig ctg23107 ( http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/ ) containing a predicted zebrafish TIF1 family gene .
This PAC was hybridized to a kidney cDNA library , resulting in the isolation of four clones that represented the same gene .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene encodes a member of the TIF1 family of transcriptional cofactors ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
The coding sequence of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> is most similar to <termsem="EG:51592"> human TIF </term> ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Friedman et al. 1996 ; Venturini et al. 1999 ) , and the locations of exon boundaries are conserved between the zebrafish and human genes ( unpublished data ) .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> locus on zebrafish Chromosome 8 is also predicted to be syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 1p that contains the <termsem="EG:51592"> TIF1 </term> gene based on the conserved locations of 12 other orthologous gene pairs , including <termsem="EG:4893"> NRAS </term> , mapped to these regions in human and zebrafish ( Barbazuk et al. 2000 ) .
Therefore , based on sequence similarity and chromosomal location , the <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> gene is the likely ortholog of the <termsem="EG:51592"> human TIF1 </term> gene .
We have identified ethyl-nitrosourea ( ENU ) - induced point mutations in three alleles of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> ( Figure 3C and 3D ) , each of which generates a premature stop codon .
The montb222b and montg234 alleles have a severe phenotype with no circulating blood cells .
In contrast , the monm262 allele has 10 -- 100 circulating blood cells by 48 hpf , in comparison to the approximately 3,000 RBCs in the circulation of wild-type or heterozygous embryos at the same time point .
The monm262 allele was found to encode a premature stop codon at position E40 , which would encode a putative protein of only 40 amino acids .
Although this mutation would be expected to lead to a complete loss of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene product , another methionine is found downstream at amino acid position 104 .
In vitro translation experiments in reticulocyte lysates demonstrate reinitiation of translation from this methionine ( unpublished data ) .
Therefore , the hypomorphic larval phenotype of the monm262 allele is likely due to partial loss of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> function or expression .
The presence of mutations in each of the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> alleles indicates that defective <termsem="EG:324053"> Tif1 </term> function is the cause of the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> phenotype .
In order to determine whether <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> is expressed in hematopoietic mesoderm , we next examined zebrafish embryos by whole-mount in situ hybridization ( Figure 4A ) .
<termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> mRNA is expressed maternally and is found throughout the embryo during blastula stages .
During gastrulation and epiboly stages , zygotic expression of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> is highest in the mesendoderm of the germ ring .
At tail bud and early somite stages a high level of <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> expression delineates a horseshoe-shaped population of ventral/lateral mesoderm that will give rise to blood and also expresses <termsem="EG:30766"> stem cell leukemiahematopoietic transcription factor </term> ( <termsem="EG:30766"> scl </term> ) ( Liao et al. 1997 ) .
This group of cells continues to express <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> and <termsem="EG:30766"> scl </term> while it converges and forms the embryonic blood island ( Detrich et al. 1995 ) .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> gene is also highly expressed in the central nervous system as well as the mesenchyme of the trunk and tail .
Homozygous montg234 mutants have a greatly reduced amount of <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> mRNA in all tissues consistent with nonsense-mediated message decay .
Thus , <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish tif1 </term> is specifically expressed in ventral mesoderm and putative hemangioblasts prior to and during the embryonic stages when hematopoietic progenitors are undergoing apoptosis in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants .
We also compared the expression of <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> to <termsem="EG:94093"> mouse Tif1 </term> ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
<termsem="EG:94093"> Mouse Tif1 </term> is highly expressed in erythroid blood islands of the yolk sac , and it is subsequently expressed in the fetal liver at a high level , and in other tissues , including the central nervous system .
Taken together these results strongly suggest that <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> and <termsem="EG:94093"> mouse Tif1 </term> are orthologs that function during hematopoiesis .
Given that mammalian TIF1 has been shown to form hetero-oligomers with Tif1 ( Peng et al. 2002 ) , we searched for additional TIF1 family members in zebrafish to compare with <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> .
Using zebrafish expressed sequence tag ( EST ) sequences , we designed primers to RT-PCR amplify a TIF1-related cDNA from embryonic 10-hpf and 24-hpf RNA .
This cDNA encodes a predicted zebrafish ortholog of <termsem="EG:8805"> human TIF1 </term> based on predicted amino acid sequences ( see Figure 3B ) .
In addition , <termsem="EG:442869"> zebrafish tif1 </term> ESTs map to LG4 in a region predicted to be syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 7 that contains the <termsem="EG:8805"> TIF1 </term> gene based on the conserved locations of eight other orthologous gene pairs , including <termsem="EG:30267"> SEMA3A </term> , mapped to these regions in human and zebrafish ( Barbazuk et al. 2000 ) .
We next compared the embryonic expression pattern of <termsem="EG:442869"> tif1 </term> mRNA to <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> by in situ hybridization .
Like mammalian TIF1 ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Niederreither et al. 1999 ) , the predicted <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish tif1 </term> gene is broadly expressed ( see Figure 4A ) .
At five somites , <termsem="EG:442869"> zebrafish tif1 </term> does not display the relatively high expression in the horseshoe-shaped region of hematopoietic mesoderm seen with <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> .
At later stages , <termsem="EG:442869"> tif1 </term> is evenly expressed throughout most of the embryo , including the developing blood islands .
Therefore , <termsem="EG:442869"> tif1 </term> is coexpressed in the same cells with <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> and may therefore be available to form hetero-oligomers in vivo .
Forced Expression of <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> Rescues Hematopoiesis in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> Mutants .
To further confirm that a mutation in the <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish tif1 </term> gene is responsible for the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant phenotype we performed embryo rescue experiments ( Figure 5A ; Table 1 ) .
Microinjection of synthetic wild-type <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mRNA at the one-cell stage rescues the formation of embryonic erythrocytes in genotyped mutant embryos without causing obvious defects in embryonic patterning or organogenesis .
At 4 d of development , 70 % ( n = 10 ) of montg234 mutants show significant ( greater than 200 cells in comparison to a wild-type estimate of 3,000 cells ) rescue of circulating hemoglobinized RBCs in comparison to control sibling mutants ( n = 75 ) .
Based on the correction of the jagged fin-fold phenotype ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) , the mesenchymal cells are rescued to a similar extent as the anemia ( unpublished data ) .
Overexpression of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> did not result in expanded blood cell numbers in wild-type embryos and was not toxic at doses that rescue the phenotype of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants ( unpublished data ) .
Since there were no expanded or ectopic blood populations in the embryos , these rescue experiments suggest that <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> functions as a permissive factor required for hematopoiesis .
Marrow Transplantation Rescues Erythropoiesis in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> Mutants .
The high levels of <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> expression in erythroid cells suggest that it functions as a cell-autonomous regulator of gene expression in hematopoietic cells .
In order to test this hypothesis , we transplanted wild-type adult zebrafish kidney marrow cells carrying a gata1 : green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) transgene into 48-hpf <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant embryos ( Figure 5B ; Table 2 ) .
The gata1 : GFP transgene makes use of the gata1 promoter to drive GFP expression and can thus be used to mark donor-derived erythroid cells ( Long et al. 1997 ) .
Untransplanted mutant embryos have no embryonic blood cells in circulation .
Following transplantation , mutant host embryos were observed daily for 2 wk .
Of 191 mutant embryos injected , 129 ( 68 % ) showed GFP + cells in circulation 2 d later .
Many recipients showed robust increases in donor-derived cells over the observation period .
Of 81 recipients initially scored as having less than ten GFP + cells at day 2 posttransplant , 13 ( 16 % ) of these demonstrated a marked increase in erythroid cells with 100 -- 1,000 GFP + cells in circulation 6 d later .
By day 10 , these transplanted embryos showed approximately 3,000 cells in circulation , similar to the number of blood cells in normal embryos .
Despite robust reconstitution of blood cells , mutant recipients did not inflate their swim bladders and thus failed to survive longer than nontransplanted sibling controls , all dying by 3 wk of age .
In contrast , 13/35 ( 37 % ) heterozygous montg234 transplants survived to early adulthood .
Similar transplants of wild-type cells can fully rescue <termsem="EG:30481"> vlad tepes </term> ( <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> ) mutants ( Traver et al. 2003 ) .
Therefore , the results of cell transplantations suggests that <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> plays a cell-autonomous role in erythroid cells , and its role in nonhematopoietic tissues , such as trunk mesenchyme or the nervous system , is also required for embryo survival .
<termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> in Punctate Nuclear Foci Is Developmentally Regulated .
In order to examine the subcellular distribution of <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein , we generated an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal 15 amino acids conserved in <termsem="EG:51592"> human TIF1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94093"> mouse Tif1 </term> .
Immunofluorescence of mouse embryo fibroblast nuclei with the anti- <termsem="EG:51592"> Tif1 </term> antiserum demonstrates that <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> is localized in small nuclear foci ( Figure 6A ) .
The localization of <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein appears different from the more diffuse nuclear patterns typically seen in studies of Tif1 ( Remboutsika et al. 2002 ) or TIF1 ( Cammas et al. 2002 ) .
A recent report demonstrates that TIF1 associates with heterochromatin-containing foci after retinoic acid treatment or serum starvation ( Cammas et al. 2002 ) .
Thus , localization or expression of the TIF1 proteins may be regulated during distinct developmental processes or by environmental cues .
The nuclear foci that contain <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> do not colocalize with two markers of heterochromatin , <termsem="EG:12419"> HP1 </term> protein and DAPI staining of DNA ( Figure 6A ) .
Furthermore , <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> does not colocalize with <termsem="EG:18854"> promyelocytic leukemia </term> gene product ( <termsem="EG:18854"> PML </term> ) nuclear bodies , DNA repair complexes that contain <termsem="EG:17535"> Mre11 </term> , or transcriptional complexes containing <termsem="EG:229906"> TFII-B </term> ( unpublished data ) .
We next examined the expression of <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein during the differentiation of G1E cells , a murine erythroleukemia cell line that can terminally differentiate into erythrocytes when a Gata1 : estrogen receptor fusion protein is stabilized in response to estrogen exposure ( Weiss et al. 1997 ) .
Western blot analysis demonstrated that <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein expression decreases with terminal erythroid differentiation ( Figure 6B ) .
Consistent with this finding , after 24 hpf , <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> mRNA expression falls during the terminal maturation of the primitive erythroid cells ( unpublished data ) .
In two different murine erythroleukemia cell lines ( MEL and G1E ) , <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> is also expressed in nuclear foci , and even though the overall <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> protein level is reduced , this nuclear foci localization does not change with differentiation ( unpublished data ) .
This provides further support for the hypothesis that <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> acts within novel nuclear foci , during erythroid differentiation .
The zebrafish is an excellent model system to elucidate the molecular machinery controlling gene expression during hematopoiesis ( Thisse and Zon 2002 ; Galloway and Zon 2003 ) .
As part of a large-scale forward genetic screen , we originally identified a complementation group of independent mutant alleles in the zebrafish gene that we named <termsem="EG:324053"> moonshine </term> ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) .
Positional cloning was used to identify the <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> gene , establishing a critical role for a transcriptional intermediary factor , <termsem="EG:324053"> Tif1 </term> , during hematopoietic development .
The <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> Gene Encodes the Zebrafish Ortholog of Mammalian TIF1 .
Our results strongly support the conclusion that we have positionally cloned the <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> gene correctly , and it is the ortholog of mammalian Tif1 .
<termsem="EG:324053"> Tif1 </term> is present in the critical genetic interval encompassing a single approximately 50-kb PAC clone defined by linkage analysis ( see Figure 3 ) .
Sequence analysis indicates that <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish tif1 </term> is most similar in predicted amino acid sequence and intron/exon structure compared to the predicted orthologous human and mouse genes .
<termsem="EG:324053"> Zebrafish tif1 </term> is located in a region of zebrafish Chromosome 8 syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 1 containing <termsem="EG:51592"> TIF1 </term> .
We identified point mutations in <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> from three different alleles of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> that each result in premature stop codons and mRNA decay .
In addition , <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> / <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells throughout embryogenesis in both zebrafish and mouse ( see Figure 4 ) .
And as predicted , forced expression of wild-type <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> mRNA efficiently rescues hematopoiesis in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants and does not perturb hematopoiesis in wild-type embryos ( see Figure 5 ) .
We have also cloned the predicted zebrafish ortholog of tif1 , which is more uniformly expressed in zebrafish embryos like mammalian TIF1 ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Niederreither et al. 1999 ) ( see Figures 3A and 4A ) and may therefore be available to form hetero-oligomers with <termsem="EG:324053"> Tif1 </term> protein in developing hematopoietic cells .
Comparing available zebrafish and mammalian TIF1-predicted amino acid sequences , it appears that the Tif1 orthologs are the most highly conserved family members while the Tif1 sequences are relatively more divergent .
We have not found a Tif1 ortholog , thus far , in the zebrafish or fugu genome or EST sequences .
It is possible that Tif1 , like the KRAB domain transcription factors it binds to , may be present only in tetrapods ( Urrutia 2003 ) .
However , more complete genome sequences will be needed to confirm this hypothesis .
Based on our analysis of <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish mon </term> mutants , it is reasonable to predict that Tif1 , the most evolutionarily conserved TIF1 family member , plays a similarly essential role in human and mouse hematopoiesis .
Mutations in <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> Cause Apoptosis of Erythroid Progenitors .
Our examination of hematopoietic gene expression , apoptosis , and marrow histology in <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants demonstrates that early erythroid progenitors are formed in homozygous mutants , but they fail to properly differentiate and instead undergo programmed cell death ( see Figure 1 ) .
The expression of <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> appears to initiate normally in the committed erythroid cells of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants .
However , the cells are abnormal prior to the complete loss of <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> expression .
TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells are abundant by the 12-somite stage of development , and by 22 hpf all hematopoietic gene expression is extinguished .
The expression of marker genes , including <termsem="EG:30766"> scl </term> and <termsem="EG:30480"> gata2 </term> , characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells and primitive hematopoietic progenitors , are also not detected in the embryonic blood islands of mutants at 22 hpf .
This indicates that the mutant hematopoietic cells are not blocked prior to commitment to the erythroid lineage , but instead develop as abnormal erythroid cells and undergo apoptosis , similar to gata1-deficient erythroid cells ( Fujiwara et al. 1996 ; Lyons et al. 2002 ) .
Defective erythropoiesis and severe anemia were also observed in rare surviving homozygous mutant <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> adults , demonstrating that <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> is also required in definitive hematopoiesis ( see Figure 2 ) .
The zygotic phenotypes of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants may not reveal the function of maternally inherited <termsem="EG:324053"> Tif1 </term> .
Maternally expressed <termsem="EG:324053"> zebrafish Tif1 </term> may play roles in hematopoiesis or other aspects of organogenesis that are not detectable due to the presence of wild-type mRNA in eggs laid by heterozygous mothers .
Analysis of the offspring of homozygous <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutant female zebrafish will aid in defining the function of this maternal mRNA .
The present analysis of zygotic <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants provides data that are consistent with the conclusion that <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> is essential for erythropoiesis but do not rule out essential functions in other hematopoietic lineages .
The hematopoietic phenotype of <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> mutants resembles the loss of erythroid cells seen in both <termsem="EG:14460"> mouse Gata1 </term> knockout embryos and <termsem="EG:30481"> zebrafish vlad tepes </term> ( gata1 ) mutant embryos ( Fujiwara et al. 1996 ; Lyons et al. 2002 ) .
In an effort to determine if there is a genetic relationship between <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> and <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> , we tested their ability to rescue erythropoiesis .
Both injection of <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> mRNA into <termsem="EG:324053"> mon </term> homozygous mutant embryos and injection of <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> mRNA into <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> knock-down embryos failed to rescue hematopoiesis ( unpublished data ) .
We also tested for a direct interaction between Tif1 and Gata1 proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays and found no association ( unpublished data ) .
Although the mutations in each of these genes arrest cells at a similar stage of development , our results suggest that <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> and <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> act independently .
This does not rule out the possibility that parallel genetic pathways involving <termsem="EG:30481"> gata1 </term> and <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> , operating together , regulate gene transcription within blood cells .
The Role of <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> in Primitive and Definitive Erythropoiesis .
Taken together , our data suggest that <termsem="EG:324053"> tif1 </term> is required as a permissive cofactor for the erythroid lineage-specific control of hematopoietic gene expression .
We reasonably predict that <termsem="EG:324053"> Tif1 </term> protein functions as a transcriptional intermediary factor in hematopoietic progenitor cells given that both TIF1 ( Zhong et al. 1999 ) and TIF1 ( Friedman et al. 1996 ; Abrink et al. 2001 ) have been shown to act as intermediary factors that positively or negatively regulate gene transcription .
These studies indicate that TIF1 and TIF1 act as scaffolds that link different classes of DNA-binding proteins and chromatin-associated proteins into larger regulatory complexes .
<termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> is detected within nuclear foci ( see Figure 6 ) , which , based on our analysis , do not appear to correspond to several types of previously described nuclear bodies , including <termsem="EG:18854"> PML </term> bodies .
Localization of <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> to these nuclear bodies may be regulated by posttranslational modification such as SUMO modification that is required for PML to form PML nuclear domains ( Zhong et al. 2000a , 2000b ; Best et al. 2002 ) .
These foci may serve as assembly points where <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> forms multisubunit complexes with DNA-binding transcription factors and their other essential coactivators or corepressors , during the early stages of erythroid differentiation .
It will be important to determine the identity of <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> - interacting proteins in nuclear foci and establish how they function with <termsem="EG:94093"> Tif1 </term> to regulate blood cell development .
Zebrafish and mouse strains and studies .
Zebrafish were maintained and staged as described ( Westerfield 1998 ) .
The alleles montb222b and montg234 were generated in a large-scale screen for ENU-induced mutations ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) on the TU , whereas the monm262 allele was derived on the AB strain and was originally called vampire ( Weinstein et al. 1996 ) .
Mapping strains were constructed by mating to WIK or SJD polymorphic strains .
