Diabetes Insipidus in Mice with a <termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutation </term> in Aquaporin-2 .
Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) is a disease characterized by failure of the kidney to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin .
Human kindreds with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have been found to harbor <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in the vasopressin receptor 2 ( Avpr2 ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> or the vasopressin-sensitive water channel aquaporin-2 ( Aqp2 ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Development of a treatment is rendered difficult due to the lack of a viable animal model .
Through forward <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> screening of ethylnitrosourea-mutagenized mice , we report the identification and characterization of a mouse model of NDI , with an F204V <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Unlike previously attempted murine models of NDI , our mice survive to adulthood and more exactly recapitulate the human disorder .
Previous in vitro experiments using renal cell lines suggest recessive Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> result in improper trafficking of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> water pore .
Using these animals , we have directly proven this hypothesis of improper AQP2 translocation as the molecular defect in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in the intact organism .
Additionally , using a renal cell line we show that the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> protein , AQP2-F204V , is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and that this abnormal localization can be rescued by <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein .
This novel mouse model allows for further mechanistic studies as well as testing of pharmacological and <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> therapies for NDI .
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) is a disease marked by excessive urination and thirst .
Normally , the hypothalamus senses situations where water is limited and signals to the kidney to increase water reabsorption from urine .
The signaling molecule secreted by the hypothalamus is <termsem="SO:0001451"> arginine </term> vasopressin ( AVP ) , which binds to a specific protein on the surface of kidney cells , AVP receptor ( AVPR2 ) .
AVP binding to its receptor on kidney cells begins a series of biochemical events that ultimately results in the insertion of a protein , aquaporin 2 ( AQP2 ) , into the outer surface of the kidney cell .
As its name suggests , AQP2 facilitates the reuptake of water from the urinary space into the cell , thus concentrating the urine and conserving water .
Congenital NDI is caused by <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in either the water channel , AQP2 , or in the receptor , AVPR2 .
While these <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> have been studied extensively in the lab , work in live animals has been very limited .
This report describes the first viable mouse model of NDI .
Previous models have been attempted by targeted <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> , i.e. , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> known to be involved in the disease have been <termsem="SO:0000041"> altered </term> in the mouse , a so-called reverse <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> approach .
Reverse <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> approaches have so far failed to produce a viable mouse model of NDI .
Here the authors take a forward <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> approach in which <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> at random and animals are screened for disease-like properties .
As well as proving hypotheses that come from lab studies , this model opens the door to the testing of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> therapy or other therapies for treatment of NDI .
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) is a disease characterized by excessive urination and thirst , despite normal production of the antidiuretic hormone <termsem="SO:0001451"> arginine </term> vasopressin ( AVP ) [ 1 ] .
The inherited forms are either X-linked as a consequence of <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of the Avpr2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 2 ] , or autosomal due to <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of the Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 3 ] .
Aquaporin-2 ( AQP2 ) is a pore-forming protein belonging to a family of water channels [ 4 ] , and it is expressed in collecting-duct principal cells in the kidney [ 5 ] .
Generally these proteins permit the passage of water through the plasma membrane ( PM ) of cells , several of which carry out this role specifically in the process of water reabsorption from urine in the kidney .
It has been established that aquaporins , although functional as a monomer , tetramerize before their insertion into the plasma membrane [ 4,6 ] .
Furthermore these proteins can also be differentially targeted to distinct regions of the PM ; for example , AQP2 is routed to the apical membrane of cells surrounding the collecting duct , whereas other aquaporins ( AQP3 or 4 ) are inserted into the basolateral face .
Unlike all other family members , AQP2 is not constitutively inserted into the plasma membrane .
Under basal conditions , the protein resides in subapical intracellular vesicles ; however , under conditions requiring water retention AQP2 translocates to the apical membrane , permitting water reabsorption [ 7,8 ] .
For this process to occur , AVP binds its receptor , AVPR2 , on the basolateral face of the collecting duct cells , leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP , ultimately resulting in phosphorylation of AQP2 at <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> 256 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase [ 9 ] and its redistribution to the plasma membrane .
The importance of AQP2 redistribution has been highlighted by functional characterization of Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> resulting in severe NDI in humans [ 3,10 ] .
Recessive Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> are generally thought to produce an abnormally localized and , in most instances , misfolded water pore that responds abnormally to an increase in cAMP [ 6,11 ] .
Furthermore , dominant <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> have been described and found to misroute both the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> and the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein to the basolateral membrane [ 6,12 ] .
Several mouse models of diabetes insipidus have been generated [ 13 -- 17 ] .
In an attempt to recapitulate human NDI , mice have been generated with <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in Aqp2 and Avpr2 [ 15,18 ] .
Yang and colleagues created a mouse with a T126M knock-in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Unexpectedly , homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice died within 6 d after birth .
Interestingly , AVPR2-deficient male pups also die within the first week after birth .
Together these models suggest that the mouse may be a highly sensitive organism with regard to water homeostasis , and is unable to survive with polyuria .
In a forward <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> screen , a mouse with an Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> was identified .
The purpose of this study was to characterize this murine model of recessive nephrogenic DI .
We now report a novel F204V <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
This <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> of Aqp2 was found to cause the first mouse model of NDI to survive past the first week of life .
Molecular analyses concluded that <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> AQP2 adopts a different subcellular localization in renal collecting-duct cells , and was resistant to translocation induced by desmopressin , an agonist of AVP .
In vitro studies using the Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line demonstrated an endoplasmic reticulum pattern for the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein , and apparent resistance to translocation .
These data conclusively prove that autosomal recessive NDI is a consequence of improper AQP2 routing in the intact mammal .
In a forward <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> screen that used ethylnitrosourea ( ENU ) to induce <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in a founder animal whose offspring were then screened for abnormal whole body metabolism [ 19,20 ] , we found a family of mice that urinated and drank excessively .
Serum and urine analysis showed that plasma glucose levels were normal and there was no glucose in the urine ( unpublished data ) .
Hence , this was an example of diabetes insipidus .
The disorder in these mice segregated in a monogenic , autosomal recessive manner , making Aqp2 a candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Sequencing of Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> of affected mice identified a thymine to guanine ( T to G ) transversion ( Figure 1A ) , which is predicted to lead to a <termsem="SO:0001436"> valine </term> for <termsem="SO:0001441"> phenylalanine </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitution </term> at <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> 204 of the protein ( F204V ) .
AQP2 is a six-transmembrane water channel , and F204 lies near the extracellular face of the sixth membrane spanning <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , a <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> rich in hydrophobic <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> .
This and the other membrane-spanning <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> are <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> among vertebrate species .
The <termsem="SO:0001441"> phenylalanine </term> at <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> 204 is particularly well <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> ( Figure 1B ) , not only among vertebrate AQP2 proteins , but also among others members of this family .
Aqp2F204V/F204V mice have dramatically increased urine production , in some cases producing an amount of urine in 24 h that exceeds their body weight , compared to their heterozygous or <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> littermates .
Such loss of water would rapidly lead to dehydration were it not compensated by increased water intake .
Indeed , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice also dramatically increase their water intake ( Figure 1C ) compared to their heterozygous or <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> littermates .
This phenotype -- increased urinary output and water intake -- showed complete concordance with homozygosity of the F204V <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the 58 animals tested .
Diabetes insipidus can be defined as an inability to concentrate urine where appropriate .
Compared to <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> or heterozygous littermates , Aqp2F204V/F204V mice produce very dilute urine ( Figure 1D ) .
Basal urine concentration in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice is about 161 mOsm , compared to about 1,293 mOsm in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice ( p < 0.001 ) .
Normally , urine concentration is under the control of the hypothalamus , which , in response to hypovolemia or hypernatremia [ 21 ] , secretes AVP .
The <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> AVP analog , 1-deamino-8-D - <termsem="SO:0001451"> arginine </term> vasopressin ( dDAVP ; also called desmopressin ) , is a potent agonist of AVPR2 .
When administered to <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice , dDAVP leads to a dramatic increase in urine concentration , from 1,293 to 5,885 mOsm ( 4.6-fold ; Figure 1D ) .
With similar treatment , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice concentrate their urine to a lesser but still significant extent , from 161 to 470 mOsm ( 2.9-fold ) , indicating that these animals are not only unable to concentrate their urine properly but are also defective in their response to dDAVP .
The smaller response to dDAVP indicates some residual activity of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> AQP2 channel , which must be sufficient to allow survival of the individual , in contrast to the T126M knock-in mouse [ 18 ] .
Multiple heterozygous matings yielded 101 animals , which appeared at a ratio of 26:49:26 , near the expected Mendelian <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> , heterozygote , and <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> frequencies , respectively , indicating that there is no reduced viability associated with this <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> .
Other than the increased urine production and water intake , there was no overt phenotype in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice , save distended kidneys , which appeared variably in adult animals ( Figure 2A ) .
Although not specifically measured , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice seem to have a normal lifespan .
The one animal that was followed lived to 18 mo , typical for animals in our colony .
Aqp2F204V/F204V mice suffer from severe hydronephrosis ( Figure 2A and 2B ) , presumably as a consequence of an inability to cope with the extreme polyuria .
We found distended kidneys in all Aqp2F204V/F204V mice ; however , the degree of inflation was variable in affected mice and worsened with age .
Severe hydronephrosis has previously been observed in double Aqp1/Aqp3 knock-out mice [ 17 ] , and appears at 6 wk .
Even at 4 wk , Aqp2F204V/F204V mice had hydronephrosis .
Histologic sections from Aqp2F204V/F204V mice demonstrated marked dilatation of the renal pelvis yet normal morphology of the ureter ( Figure 2C and 2D ) .
In particular , the muscularis propria was neither hypertrophied nor thinned .
There was the normal festooned appearance of the urothelium , and this transitional epithelium was of normal thickness .
There was thinning of the kidney as measured from renal capsule to renal pelvis .
However , the morphologic features of the glomeruli and proximal/distal tubules were unremarkable ( Figure 2D ) .
As shown previously [ 18,22 ] , immunoblotting revealed three <termsem="SO:0001060"> different forms </term> of AQP2 , due to different degrees and forms of glycosylation ( Figure 3A ) .
Previous reports have demonstrated that nonglycosylated protein appears as a 29 kDa band , while complex glycosylated protein runs as a smear between 35 and 45 kDa .
A short-lived <termsem="SO:0000933"> intermediate </term> <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> of 31 kDa representing core , high-mannose glycosylation of AQP2 is apparent from pulse-chase labeling experiments [ 22 ] .
Compared to that from the kidneys of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> animals , AQP2 from <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals was reduced in both the high molecular weight , diffuse <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> and the lowest molecular weight <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> , but enriched in the <termsem="SO:0000933"> intermediate </term> molecular weight <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> ( Figure 3A ) .
Heterozygous animals showed intermediate amounts of all three <termsem="SO:0001060"> forms </term> .
The nature of these glycosylated <termsem="SO:0001060"> forms </term> was revealed by digestion with endoglycosidase H , which specifically cleaves mannose-rich carbohydrate from the protein backbone .
Treatment of endogenous AQP2 from kidneys of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> , heterozygous , and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals specifically affected the <termsem="SO:0000933"> intermediate </term> molecular weight <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> ( Figure 3B ) .
The presence of some mature glycosylated proteins ( 35 -- 45 kDa ) in Aqp2F204V/F204V mice presumably permits their survival compared to Aqp2T126M/T126M mice , and is consistent with a diminished response to dDAVP .
In humans , recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of Aqp2 are postulated to cause NDI because they do not properly translocate to the apical cell surface in response to AVP .
This postulate comes solely from in vitro studies in which <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> corresponding to human disease <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> are transfected into kidney cell lines .
In general , such recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , when visualized immunocytochemically , fail to localize to AVP-responsive vesicles .
Rather , they get trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .
Our mouse model of NDI affords the first opportunity to test this hypothesis in a mature animal .
As shown in Figure 4A ( top row of photomicrographs ) , AQP2 ( stained red ) normally localized to the subapical region of collecting duct cells in kidneys of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice .
Upon stimulation with dDAVP , AQP2 translocated to or near the cell surface ( Figure 4A , second row ) .
In kidneys taken from <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals , however , AQP2 was distributed randomly throughout the cell in the basal state ( Figure 4A , third row ) , while AQP3 ( green ) appropriately localized to the basolateral surface [ 23 ] .
Furthermore , upon dDAVP stimulation , AQP2-F204V failed to translocate to the cell surface ( Figure 4A , bottom row ) .
To confirm these findings , the staining was repeated in kidneys taken from two further mice for each class , <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> or <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> , with or without dDAVP treatment , with identical results .
To investigate the mechanism of defective translocation of AQP2-F204V , we turned to transfection of MDCK cells .
Stable cell lines expressing mouse <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 and AQP2-F204V were established .
Immunoblots of protein extracts from stable cell lines showed that MDCK cells recapitulate the glycosylation defect seen in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice ( unpublished data ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein was again present in three <termsem="SO:0001060"> different forms </term> .
Cells expressing AQP2-F204V lacked the 35 -- 45 kDa <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> and were enriched in the core-glycosylated 31 kDa <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> .
In transfected , unstimulated MDCK cells , <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 ( stained green ) appeared in a punctate pattern distributed throughout the subapical region ( Figure 4B , left column photomicrographs ) , consistent with vesicular compartmentalization .
AQP2-F204V , on the other hand , appeared in a punctate but perinuclear pattern ( Figure 4B , third column ) .
Upon stimulation with forskolin , a cAMP-dependent protein kinase activator , <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 translocated to the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells ( Figure 4B , second column ) .
Along the z-axis , the perinuclear distribution of AQP2-F204V was clearly seen , and this distribution is not altered by forskolin ( Figure 4B , bottom row , two right columns ) .
The perinuclear distribution of AQP2-F204V is consistent with an ER compartmentalization .
To test the idea that AQP2-F204V localizes to the ER , we co-stained cells transfected with Aqp2F204V ( <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> ) for AQP2 and an ER marker , calnexin ( Figure 4C ) .
Colocalization of calnexin with AQP2 was investigated directly , and it was found that 80 % of all AQP2-F204V protein colocalized with calnexin .
The remaining 20 % appeared at the periphery of the ER , representing AQP2-F204V that had potentially progressed beyond the ER .
This `` ER escape '' was consistent with the small proportion of mature , complex glycosylated , AQP2-F204V in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys ( see Figure 3A ) .
Animals heterozygous for the Aqp2F204V <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> were not affected in their urine production or urine osmolality ( see Figure 1C and 1D ) .
It has also been shown that a recessive NDI <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , AQP2-R187C , does not interact with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein in oocytes [ 24 ] , nor does it homo-oligomerize in MDCK cells [ 22 ] .
Therefore , kidneys from heterozygous animals were examined for evidence of two populations of AQP2 protein .
Surprisingly , immunohistochemical staining of kidney collecting ducts from Aqp2F204V / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> mice revealed a pattern remarkably similar to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> ( Figure 5A ) .
AQP2 translocated completely to the apical cell surface upon dDAVP stimulation .
This <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> staining pattern may simply reflect the fact that decreasing the amount of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein by half makes it undetectable by immunocytochemistry .
Alternatively , the presence of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein may alter the localization of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein .
Indeed , Hendriks et al. proposed a `` piggy-back '' mechanism to explain the transport of nonglycosylated subunits of AQP2 to the cell surface by glycosylated subunits [ 22 ] .
It has also been shown that <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 protein can rescue a translocation-defective <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein , AQP2-P262L , when the two are coexpressed in MDCK cells [ 25 ] .
In the collecting ducts from Aqp2F204V / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> mice , the <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> may rescue the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein as suggested by the subcellular distribution of AQP2 protein .
To test this idea , we first looked for an interaction between <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> and <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> proteins in transfected MDCK cells ( Figure 5B ) .
MDCK cells stably expressing <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 were transiently transfected with GFP expression <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> encoding GFP-tagged <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 , AQP2-F204V , or GFP alone .
Antibodies against GFP coimmunoprecipitated <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 when AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP was transiently transfected , but not when GFP by itself was transiently transfected into MDCK cells stably expressing <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 ( Figure 5B , upper blots ) .
Western blot of total membranes showed that <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 is equivalently expressed in all three cases ( Figure 5B , lower blots ) .
If <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> proteins are indeed interacting in the cell , is this interaction sufficient to rescue the localization of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein ?
To answer this question , we used MDCK cells stably transfected with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 expressing <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> or with empty <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> .
On top of these , we transiently transfected AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP expression <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> .
AQP2-GFP localized to the apical surface upon forskolin stimulation whether it was transiently transfected into <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> - only cells ( Figure 5C , upper left images ) or into <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 cells ( Figure 5C , upper right ) .
AQP2-F204V-GFP , when expressed by transient transfection into <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> only cells , showed a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution pattern ( Figure 5C , lower left ) .
When expressed in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 cells , however , AQP2-F204V-GFP localized to the apical surface to varying degrees ( Figure 5C , lower right images [ i -- iii ] ) .
The lower right images of Figure 5C shows three cells from a single transfection .
The first is a nontransfected cell that shows the localization of the stably expressing <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 , which is apical upon forskolin stimulation .
The next two show expression of both the stable <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 and the transient AQP2-F204V-GFP .
In cell ( ii ) , localization of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 was indistinguishable from AQP2-F204V-GFP ; both were apical upon forskolin stimulation .
Although the effect was subtle in cell ( iii ) , AQP2-F204V-GFP was partly localized to the apical surface .
Generally , the localization of AQP2-F204V-GFP was clearly more apical when <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 was also expressed .
To confirm these results biochemically , we transfected the same cell lines ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 or <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> ) with F204V-GFP , biotinylated surface proteins after forskolin stimulation , and precipitated the biotinylated proteins ( Figure 5D ) .
AQP2-F204V-GFP is expressed approximately equally in both cell lines ( Figure 5D , total cells ) , but is biotinylated only when <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 is also expressed ( Figure 5D , surface biotinylated ) .
Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin , these results indicate that AQP2-F204V is transported to the cell surface when <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 is present , but not on its own .
Aqp2F204/F204V mice are viable and grow and reproduce normally .
They are , however , severely defective in their ability to concentrate urine , leading to increased urine output and water intake , thus making them the first mouse model of NDI to survive to maturity .
In humans , NDI is caused by <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in Avpr2 or Aqp2 .
Knockout of the X-linked Avpr2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in mice [ 15 ] gave an NDI-like phenotype in male , hemizygous neonates , but the phenotype could not be assessed in adults as the mice died within 1 wk of birth .
The adult heterozygous females showed a mild tendency toward increased urinary output and water intake and decreased urine osmolality .
Knockout of the mouse Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> has not been reported .
A knock-in of a human disease-causing <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( T126M ) , however , has been made [ 18 ] .
These mice have a severe urine-concentrating defect resulting in dehydration and death within 1 wk of birth .
Curiously , AQP2-T126M does localize properly in at least a subset of cells .
The grossly abnormal collecting duct morphology makes it impossible to pinpoint the molecular defect in these knock-in mice .
The T126M knock-in clearly shows that Aqp2 is an essential <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 18 ] .
The fact that our mice survive shows either that AQP2-F204V possesses some residual water transporting ability or that there are AVP-independent pathways for water reabsorption .
Residual activity of AQP2-F204V is likely , as <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals show some small response to dDAVP , although dDAVP-stimulated urine osmolality remains quite low .
Immunostaining of kidney shows that AQP2-F204V does not efficiently transport water , because it fails to localize to the apical cell surface after dDAVP treatment .
Some residual activity of AQP2 would imply that some small , undetectable portion of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein is getting to the cell surface .
The surface biotinylation experiment ( Figure 5D ) suggests that no <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein gets to the surface , but this does not necessarily reflect the situation in vivo .
While this small fraction of protein may not be detectable by immunofluorescence , Western blotting shows that some <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein does progress beyond the ER ( 35 -- 45 kDa <termsem="SO:0001060"> species </term> in Figure 3A ) .
Compared to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein is enriched in the high-mannose , core-glycosylated <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> ( 31 kDa ) and deficient in nonglycosylated ( 29 kDa ) and complex glycosylated ( 35 -- 45 kDa ) <termsem="SO:0001060"> forms </term> .
The presence of a reduced but detectable amount of protein in the 35 -- 45 kDa range indicates that <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein is transported out of the ER , but with greatly reduced efficiency .
Colocalization of AQP2-F204V with the ER protein calnexin in transfected MDCK cells shows that , while most of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein is trapped in the ER , some does progress beyond the ER .
Diminished response to dDAVP , diminished abundance of mature glycosylated protein in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals , and the transport of a fraction of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein beyond the ER in MDCK cells are all consistent with the notion that AQP2-F204V misfolding is limited and that it may retain some residual water transporting activity .
Evidently this residual activity is sufficient for the viability and growth of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals .
Reduced efficiency in exiting the ER may explain why AQP2-F204V is enriched in the 31 kDa high-mannose glycosylated <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> .
The high-mannose core oligosaccharide is added in the ER and is later <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> and elaborated in the Golgi apparatus [ 26 ] .
The increase in the high-mannose glycosylated <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> of AQP2-F204V may simply reflect its prolonged presence in the ER and exposure to oligosaccharyl transferase .
While improper localization of AQP2 explains the phenotype of homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice , the complete lack of a phenotype in heterozygous mice is more difficult to explain .
Physiologically , heterozygous mice have no symptoms ( see Figure 1C ) , and they are indistinguishable from <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> on immunostaining of kidneys ( Figure 5A ) .
The presence of 50 % of the normal amount of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein may explain the lack of symptoms , but it can not explain the lack of any ER-retained <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein .
Rather , the phenotype of the Aqp2F204V / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> animals suggests that the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein is being rescued by the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein .
Indeed , de Mattia et al. ( 26 ) have demonstrated that one recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> of Aqp2 , P262L , does not properly translocate when expressed by itself in MDCK cells , but that in the presence of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein , it localizes normally .
The same mechanism seems to apply in vivo with Aqp2F204V / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> mice .
In support of this , AQP2-F204V can interact with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 ( Figure 5B ) , and when coexpressed with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein , AQP2-F204V can reach the cell surface ( Figure 5C bottom right panel and 5D ) .
Although it has been demonstrated that a recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( encoding AQP2-R187C ) of NDI fails to interact with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 [ 6 ] , here we show that AQP2-F204V does interact with the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> protein , presumably as part of heterotetramers , and represents a rescuable <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , both in vitro and in vivo .
Immunostaining the kidneys of homozygous Aqp2F204V/F204V mice shows that the <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutant </term> - expressing collecting duct cells can not mediate water reabsorption , because it fails to insert into the apical plasma membrane in response to dDAVP .
This is this first in vivo proof of a long-standing hypothesis that comes from in vitro studies with recessive Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
Transfection into MDCK cells of any of several Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> corresponding to recessive human <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> shows abnormal subcellular localization [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] and failure to appropriately translocate to the plasma membrane .
Thus , misfolding , retention in the ER , and failure to translocate in response to dDAVP were proposed as the mechanism for autosomal recessive NDI .
Here we not only prove this hypothesis but also establish a useful model for human NDI .
This mouse model of NDI based on an Aqp2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> that can be rescued provides the opportunity to test therapies , including <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> therapy , that may promote proper subcellular localization .

Urine measurements .
Total urine output was measured by separately housing adult mice in Nalgene Metabolic Cages ( Minimitter , Bend , Oregon , United States ) for 2 -- 3 d and collecting urine every 24 h period .
Urine osmolalities were determined using an Osmometer ( Osmette 5004 ; Precision Systems , Natick , Massachusetts , United States ) .
Urine concentrating experiments were carried out by intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP ( 0.4 g/kg ) .
Mice were injected twice with dDAVP , once at time 0 and again at 30 min .
Urine was collected at the start of the experiment and 30 min after the second injection .
Kidney membrane preparation .
Whole mouse kidneys were homogenized in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 350 mM sucrose , and 5 mM EDTA containing protease inhibitors ( Sigma-Aldrich , # P-8340 ) in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer .
The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C .
Pelleted membranes were resuspended in the same buffer , and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay .
Immunoblotting .
Kidney membrane fractions ( 60 g ) were resolved on a 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
Membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) , followed by an overnight incubation ( at 4 C ) with AQP2 polyclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , California , United States ; #sc -9882 ) .
Membranes were washed in TBST then incubated with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody .
Membranes were washed further in TBST and bands were visualized using ECL reagent ( Amersham Biosciences , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) .
Endoglycosidase digestion .
Kidney membranes ( 60 g ) were incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 5.5 ) , 0.1 % SDS , and 50 mM -mercaptoethanol , heated to 100 C for 5 min , then cooled .
Endoglycosidase H ( 0.01 units ; Sigma-Aldrich ) was added and incubated at 37 C for 2 h .
The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer .
Total reactants were immunoblotted as described above .
Coimmunoprecipitation and biotinylation in MDCK cells .
MDCK cells stably expressing <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 ( grown on 10-cm plates ) were transfected with pEGFP - <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 , pEGFP-AQP2-F204V , or <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> alone .
The cells were homogenized in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 1 mM EDTA , and 250 mM sucrose 40 h later .
The clarified supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 g for 30 min .
Pelleted membranes were resuspended in the same buffer but containing 4 % sodium deoxycholate and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. From the dissolved membranes , a 30 l sample was removed and used as the total membrane fraction .
The remaining membranes were diluted with 600 l of the homogenization buffer , and incubated with 1 l of GFP antisera ( Invitrogen , # 46 -- 0092 ) and protein A/G sepharose .
Following overnight incubation , the precipitated proteins were washed in RIPA buffer and finally boiled in 50 l of Laemmli buffer .
Half of the total membrane and the IP fractions were processed for immunoblotting .
Cell surface biotinylation was performed in a similar manner .
However , pEGFP-AQP2-F204V , was transfected into MDCK cells stably expressing <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> AQP2 and cells made stable with <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> alone .
Twenty-four hours post-transfection , cells were stimulated with forskolin , trypsinized , resuspended in 1 ml of PBS ( 2.5  106 cells/ml ) , and incubated with 0.5 mg of NHS-PEO4-biotin ( Pierce Biotechnology ) for 30 min at room temperature .
Cells were washed once in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) and three times in PBS , after which membranes were purified and solubilized as described above .
Solubilized membranes were incubated with 20 l of immobilized streptavidin ( Pierce Biotechnology ) for 2 h at 4 C .
Finally the precipitated proteins were washed in RIPA buffer and boiled in 50 l of Laemmli buffer .
Total cells and the biotinylated precipitates were immunoblotting using an antibody to AQP2 .
Kidney immunohistochemistry .
Whole mouse kidneys were fixed in 10 % phosphate-buffered formalin for 24 h. Kidneys were embedded in paraffin , and 5-m sections were prepared .
Following antigen retrieval using 10 mM sodium citrate ( pH 8 ) for 10 min at 98 C , sections were sequentially probed , first for AQP3 and then for AQP2 .
Sections were incubated in 5 % donkey serum and then in goat anti-AQP3 antibody ( 1:100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; #sc -9885 ) .
Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , Oregon , United States ) .
The slides were subsequently blocked in 5 % chicken serum , incubated with a rabbit anti-AQP2 antibody ( 1:250 ; USB , Cleveland , Ohio , United States ; #A3000 -- 06 ) , which was detected with a AlexaFluor 594-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit antibody ( 1:500 ; Molecular Probes ) .
The sections were stained with DAPI and mounted in Vectashield ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , California , United States ) .

Cells were treated with or without 150 M forskolin for 90 min , and fixed in methanol at  20 C .
Subsequently , cells were washed and permeabilized in 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 5 min , and sequentially probed for AQP2 and organelle markers for either the PM or the ER .
AQP2 was detected using goat anti-AQP2 ( 1:100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; #sc -9882 ) and a 1:200 dilution of AlexaFluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody .
The PM and ER were probed using mouse anti-Na + / K + - ATPase ( Upstate , Waltham , Massachusetts , United States ) or rabbit anti-calnexin ( Stressgen Biotechnology , Victoria , British Columbia , Canada ) antibodies and the secondary antibodies , Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse ( 1:200 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , Pennsylvania , United States ) or AlexaFluor 594-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit ( 1:200 ) respectively .
Cells were washed in PBS , counterstained with DAPI , and mounted in Vectashield .
In experiments in which GFP fusions were used , AQP2 was probed using the antibody combination used for kidney immunohistochemistry in order to detect the AQP2 at 594 nm , to distinguish between the GFP <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> proteins .
