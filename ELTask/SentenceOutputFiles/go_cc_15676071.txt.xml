Synaptogenesis and <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation are perturbed in the neural retina of Crx mutant mice .
In Leber 's congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) , affected individuals are blind , or nearly so , from birth .
This early onset suggests abnormal development of the neural retina .
Mutations in genes that affect the development and/or function of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> have been found to be responsible in some families .
These examples include mutations in the photoreceptor transcription factor , Crx .
A Crx mutant strain of mice was created to serve as a model for LCA and to provide more insight into Crx 's function .
In this study , an ultrastructural analysis of the developing retina in Crx mutant mice was performed .
<termsem="GO:0001750"> Outer segment </term> morphogenesis was found to be blocked at the elongation stage , leading to a failure in production of the phototransduction apparatus .
Further , Crx - / - photoreceptors demonstrated severely abnormal <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> <termsem="GO:0043679"> endings </term> in the outer plexiform layer .
This is the first report of a synaptogenesis defect in an animal model for LCA .
These data confirm the essential role this gene plays in multiple aspects of photoreceptor development and extend our understanding of the basic pathology of LCA .
Photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> play a primary role in vision by capturing light energy and converting it into neural stimuli .
These sensory neurons are a shared element in all organisms capable of sensing light .
In humans , genetic diseases of the eye are common and the primary site of disease is most frequently photoreceptors ( for review see [ 1-3 ] ) .
Photoreceptors have been well studied , particularly with respect to the biochemistry and physiology of phototransduction .
Insight into the development of vertebrate photoreceptors , however , has lagged behind our understanding of function .
Only recently have the first molecular mechanisms regulating photoreceptor development been identified ( for review see , [ 2,4 ] ) .
Crx ( cone-rod homeobox ) is an otx-family homeobox gene expressed predominantly in photoreceptors , from early in their development through to the adult ages [ 5-7 ] .
Crx gene expression is critically dependent upon Otx2 , another member of the same homeobox family which is expressed in early photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 8 ] .
In rod photoreceptors , Crx appears to work in concert with Nrl , a leucine zipper protein that is also restricted in its expression in the retina to rod photoreceptors [ 9 ] .
Many photoreceptor-specific genes have putative Crx-binding elements in their regulatory regions [ 10 ] , including rhodopsin [ 11 ] and arrestin [ 12 ] .
Mutations in Crx have been associated with several human diseases that lead to blindness , including cone-rod dystrophy 2 [ 6,13,14 ] , retinitis pigmentosa [ 14 ] , and LCA [ 14-16 ] .
Based on these data , Crx was hypothesized to play a critical role in the differentiation and maintainance of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 5,7 ] .
LCA is the most severe genetic disease of photoreceptors ( see [ 17 ] , for recent review ) .
Affected infants exhibit a complete or near complete absence of vision from birth .
Mutations in retinal specific genes , such as Crx , have been associated with LCA [ 14,15 ] , as well as GUCY2D [ 18 ] , RPE65 [ 19 ] , AIPL-1 [ 20 ] , CRB-1 [ 21 ] , and RPGRIP-1 [ 22 ] .
There also may be as many as three additional genetically linked loci where genes have not been identified [ 23 ] .
Crx mutations in LCA are varied , and include a putative dominant mutation that is proposed to encode a dominant-negative form of Crx [ 14,15 ] .
Recessive mutations also have been reported and at least one allele encodes a protein with decreased DNA-binding activity [ 16 ] .
Histopathological and ultrastructural studies of LCA should enable a better understanding of the disease process , and the design of suitable therapies .
Few such studies exist for human LCA ( reviewed in [ 17 ] ) and the majority of such studies examine the globes of adults with LCA , after the tissue has undergone secondary changes .
Only a single study exists where the developing eye of an infant was examined [ 24 ] .
Animal models for LCA have recently been reported and have already served to broaden our understanding of the pathology of this disease [ 25-28 ] .
Since LCA is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder , additional mouse models are in order to allow a full understanding of the many ways in which photoreceptor development can go awry .
In addition to their importance as a locus of disease , photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> serve as an excellent model for studies in neuronal differentiation .
Photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> are highly polarized .
At their <termsem="GO:0045177"> apex </term> , these neurons have a <termsem="GO:0016020"> membranous </term> <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> , which contains proteins involved in the phototransduction cascade .
Loss of function mutations in rhodopsin [ 29 ] , or the structural protein , peripherin [ 30 ] , result in an inability to form <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> .
At the other extremity , photoreceptors terminate with <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> <termsem="GO:0043679"> endings </term> that make contact with the processes of horizontal and bipolar <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 31,32 ] .
Rod spherules establish an invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> with rod bipolar <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> and <termsem="GO:0030424"> axonal </term> <termsem="GO:0043679"> endings </term> of horizontal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
This <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> is characterized by the presence of a ribbon in the presynaptic <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> .
Cone pedicles make invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> with the <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> of on-cone bipolar <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and horizontal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and basal junctions with the <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> of off-cone bipolar <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
The factors regulating the formation of the photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> are completely unknown .
At least one photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> protein , HRG4 , contains a potential Crx target sequence in its transcriptional regulatory sequence [ 33 ] .
Few studies of LCA animal models have extended their examination of retinal pathology to the ultrastructural level .
Certain features of neuronal differentiation , such as <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> formation , can be detected definitively at this level of analysis .
With the hope of understanding the neuropathology of LCA in greater detail , we have analyzed the differentiation of the outer retina in Crx - / - mice at the ultrastructural level .
These retinas exhibit several prominent defects .
Crx - / - photoreceptors demonstrate a complete block in <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation at the elongation stage .
Further , these <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> exhibit abnormal <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> morphology , thereby broadening the function of Crx to photoreceptor synaptogenesis .
This represents the first report strongly implicating the process of <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> formation in LCA .
Multiple pathologies in the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> layer in Crx - / - mice .
A standard knock-out protocol was used to generate mice in which the homeodomain of Crx - / - was targeted and deleted .
Generation of these Crx - / - mice has been reported elsewhere [ 34 ] .
In this study , in order to characterize further the role of Crx in photoreceptor morphogenesis , the outer retinae from Crx - / - mice were examined using transmission electron microscopy .
At postnatal day 21 ( P21 ) , when Crx + / + photoreceptors exhibited robust <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> ( Figure 1A , os ) , Crx - / - retinas were without a recognizable <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> layer ( Figure 1B ) .
Crx - / - photoreceptors had <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> , demonstrating at least limited photoreceptor polarization in the Crx mutant , but the <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> were extremely short ( Figure 2 ) .
Furthermore , the majority of <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> showed some morphological differentiation , having approximately as many <termsem="GO:0005739"> mitochondria </term> as the control ( Figure 1 and 2 ) .
Occasionally , an <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segment </term> undergoing lysis was noted , appearing swollen or with <termsem="GO:0005773"> vacuoles </term> and swollen <termsem="GO:0005739"> mitochondria </term> ( data not shown ) .

<termsem="GO:0001917"> Photoreceptor inner segments </term> and outer segments are joined by a <termsem="GO:0032391"> non-motile connecting cilium </term> that exhibits a characteristic 9 + 0 arrangement of <termsem="GO:0005874"> microtubule </term> doublets when viewed in cross-section .
At P21 , in Crx - / - retinas , numerous cross sections of <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> were noted ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
Sporadically , <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> contained other than the typical complement of <termsem="GO:0005874"> microtubule </term> doublets .
For example , in Figure 3A , the <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilium </term> labelled by arrowhead 1 , shows 7 + 0 doublets .
The majority exhibited the characteristic 9 + 0 doublets ( arrowhead 2 and 3 in Figure 3A and Figure 3B ) .
These observations indicate that in addition to <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segment </term> formation , ciliogenesis is also largely intact in Crx - / - photoreceptors .
Further , in Crx - / - retinas the retinal pigmented epithelium ( PE ) appeared normal , at least up to P21 ( data not shown ) , the oldest age examined .

Figure shows <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> viewed from the scleral side with the pigmented epithelium removed .
Scale bar = 1 m .
In addition to the complete absence of <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> , Crx - / - retinas exhibited three other notable pathologies in the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> layer .
First , an abnormal deposition of <termsem="GO:0031012"> matrix </term> of unknown identity was noted ( Figure 3A , mx ) .
Second , sporadically displaced <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> were found residing in the <termsem="GO:0005576"> space </term> abutting the PE .
Occasionally , these <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> appeared pyknotic ( Figure 3A , n ) ; but , more frequently exhibited the <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> pattern typical of photoreceptors ( data not shown ) , strongly suggesting that they belonged to ectopic photoreceptors .
The third pathological entity noted in the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> layer were numerous small <termsem="GO:0031982"> vesicles </term> ( Figure 3A arrow ) 100 to 200 nm in diameter .
They appeared to be emerging from the <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> , as scanning electron microscopic images showed spherical structures budding from the <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> ( Figure 3C , arrow ) .
In order to characterize further the morphogenesis of Crx - / - photoreceptors , the developing <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> layer was viewed by scanning electron microscopy at P7 , P14 and P21 ( Figure 4 ) .
In Crx + / + retinas , <termsem="GO:0001917"> photoreceptor inner segments </term> , <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> , and the first rudimentary <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> structures were noted at P7 .
In the Crx - / - retina , only an occassional <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilium </term> was noted emerging from <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> at this stage ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
This observation was confirmed by comparison with transmission electron micrographs ( Figure 5 ) .
These differences are the earliest noted differences between Crx + / + and Crx - / - photoreceptors .
At P14 , elongating <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> were noted on Crx + / + photoreceptors , occasionally demonstrating a paddle-like structure at their <termsem="GO:0045177"> apex </term> ( Figure 4C , os ) .
In Crx - / - retinae , the vast majority of photoreceptors at this stage demonstrated <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> without <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> ( Figure 4D , cc ) .
Sporadically , Crx - / - photoreceptors would exhibit an irregular structure extending from a <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilium </term> ( Figure 4D , cc * ) perhaps representing a malformed <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> .
Such structures were also observed at P21 ( Figure 4F , cc * ) .
These putative , abnormal <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> were only rarely noted in Crx + / + at P14 , and never at P21 ( Figure 4C and 4E , cc * ) .
Further , in Crx - / - photoreceptors , unusually long <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> were noted ( Figure 4F , cc ) .
Serial examination of Crx - / - photoreceptors at P7 , P10 , P14 , and P21 by TEM , demonstrated a distinctive lack of any structure interpretable as orderly stacks of discs or forming discs .
These data demonstrate a complete absence of normal <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation in the Crx mutant mouse , and the arrest of development of the photoreceptor appendage at the elongation stage of <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation .

In Crx + / + retina , numerous <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> ( A , cc ) were evident at P7 with rudimentary <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> .
After P7 , in Crx + / + <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> elongation occurs .
Initially , <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> have a paddle-like structure ( C , os ) which is later shed ( E , os ) .
In Crx - / - photoreceptors , few <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> were observed at P7 ( B , cc ) .
After P7 , <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> were more numerous and occasionally a malformed <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> was noted extending from a <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilium </term> ( D and F , cc * ) .
These were rarely observed in Crx + / + and only at P14 ( C , cc * ) .

( B ) Crx - / - photoreceptors exhibited <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilia </term> ( <termsem="GO:0032391"> cc </term> ) at this early stage , however , nascent <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment structures </term> were not observed .
Scale Bar = 1 m .
Finally , the morphology of the malformed Crx - / - photoreceptors was compared to rhodopsin - / - and peripherin - / - photoreceptors .
Rhodopsin and peripherin are two photoreceptor-specific genes whose expression is significantly downregulated in the Crx - / - retinae [ 10,34,35 ] .
Loss of function mutations in each of these genes separately have been reported to result in a failure to elaborate <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> [ 29,30 ] .
Photoreceptors from these two mutant mice examined by SEM from the scleral side appeared highly similar to Crx - / - photoreceptors ( compare Figure 4F to Figure 6A and 6B ) .

Crx is necessary for the formation of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> .
In a previous study , we demonstrated that forced expression of a dominant-negative allele of Crx in developing rods blocked formation of both rod spherules in the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) and <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> [ 7 ] .
To expand on these studies , the ultrastructure of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> was examined in Crx - / - retinas .
In Crx + / + retinas at P21 , newly mature rod spherules were abundant ( Figure 7A ) .
The sperules were blunt or club-shaped structures with a single ribbon associated with a single invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> ( Figure 7A , arrow indicates one example ; Figure 8A and 8B ) .
Two processes from horizontal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> were situated on either side of the <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> ridge ( Figure 8B , labelled H ) and one or more <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> of rod bipolar <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> occupied a central position ( Figure 8B , bipolar labelled B ) .
Cone <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> are large , flat pedicles that exhibit many invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> containing separate sets of horizontal and bipolar <termsem="GO:0042995"> <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> processes </term> .
Each pedicle contains numerous ribbons .
These <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> were much less common than spherules in Crx + / + retinas at P21 ( Figure 7 , box ) .
In the OPL of Crx - / - retinas , photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> were highly disorganized at P21 ( Figure 7B , arrows ) .
<termsem="GO:0042995"> Processes </term> containing <termsem="GO:0008021"> <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> vesicles </term> and ribbon-like structures were apparent , suggesting at least limited generation of <termsem="GO:0044456"> <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> components </term> .
However , well formed spherules and pedicles were not observed .
In addition , many <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> appeared to contain multiple ribbons ( Figure 8C and 8D , r ) not tethered to the <termsem="GO:0005886"> plasma membrane </term> and occasionally in <termsem="GO:0048471"> perinuclear positions </term> ( Figure 8D ) .

The spherules were club-shaped and contained a single invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> with one ribbon complex .
Cone <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> form large , flat pedicles that contain many invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> with separate ribbon structures .
These <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> were more scarce , but apparent in Crx + / + retinas at P21 ( one example in box ) .
( B ) In the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) of Crx - / - retinas , photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> appeared highly disorganized at P21 ( arrows ) .

Many <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> appeared to contain multiple ribbon-like structures , instead of a singule ribbon .

In this study , an ultrastructural analysis of Crx - / - photoreceptors was carried out .
As Crx mutations have been associated with Leber 's congenital amaurosis , the findings in this study broaden our understanding of the pathology of this disease .
Two prominent pathologies were characterized in the Crx - / - retina : ( 1 ) An absolute block in <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> morphogenesis was noted , with the block occuring at the elongation stage of <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation ; ( 2 ) Crx - / - photoreceptors exhibited a severe perturbation in <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> formation .
This represents the first report of a synaptogenesis defect in an animal model of LCA .
Crx - / - photoreceptors can not complete <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> morphogenesis .
Mutations in Crx represent one of a collection of gene mutations that lead to an <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation defect .
Homozygous null mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene [ 36 ] or in rhodopsin [ 29 ] lead to a failure of <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation .
The deficits in peripherin - / - and Crx - / - photoreceptor morphogenesis were found to be very similar .
<termsem="GO:0031982"> Vesicular structures </term> in Crx - / - photoreceptors were observed that were similar to those previously noted in the rds/peripherin - / - mouse .
It was initially proposed that these <termsem="GO:0031982"> vesicles </term> were due to the breakdown of <termsem="GO:0042622"> <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> membranes </term> that were not properly recruited to the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> in the absence of peripherin , or were from the result of the breakdown of the <termsem="GO:0005902"> microvilli </term> of Mller <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 30 ] .
Strong support in favor of the former explanation was provided by Nir and colleagues who demonstrated the presence of rhodopsin protein in these <termsem="GO:0031982"> vesicles </term> using immunoelectron microscopy against a rhodopsin epitope [ 37 ] .
Further , as shown here , the <termsem="GO:0031982"> vesicles </term> appear to bud from the <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segments </term> themselves .
In developing photoreceptors , an extraordinary growth process occurs whereby the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> is generated from the nascent <termsem="GO:0032391"> connecting cilium </term> ( see [ 38 ] and references therein ) .
Peripherin/RDS and ROM-1 proteins ( localized in disc rims ) and the opsin proteins ( localized throughout the discs ) have important roles in the structural integrity of mature <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> ( see [ 39,29 ] ) .
ROM-1 - / - mice produce disorganized <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> with large disks [ 40 ] .
Crx , by virtue of being a transcription factor , presumably controls genes that are responsible for the building and perhaps maintenance of the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment structure </term> , including rhodopsin and peripherin .
Using northern blots [ 34 ] , microarrays [ 10 ] , and serial analysis of gene expression ( SAGE ) [ 35 ] , we have defined a large number of genes that are altered in their expression level in Crx - / - mice .
We found that rhodopsin expression was severely diminished in Crx - / - animals , and peripherin mRNA was reduced by approximately 30 % .
Transgenic mice with variable levels of expression of wild type rhodopsin exhibit rod degeneration [ 41 ] , indicating the importance of the level of rhodopsin expression .
In addition , the timing of rhodopsin expression may be very important , as indicated by studies in Drosophila .
In Drosophila , rhodopsin ( ninaE ) is expressed in photoreceptors R1 -- R6 .
In ninaE null mutants , the <termsem="GO:0016028"> rhabdomere </term> , a structure analogous to vertebrate outer segments , fails to develop in R1 -- R6 photoreceptors [ 42 ] , reminiscent of the situation in rhodopsin - / - mice [ 29 ] .
An intriguing experiment by Kumar et al. [ 43 ] demonstrated a temporal requirement for rhodopsin expression during <termsem="GO:0016028"> rhabdomere </term> development .
In ninaE null flies , a ninaE transgene under the control of a heat shock promoter was subjected to various temperature shifts during development .
Heat shock during the normal time of rhodopsin onset resulted in substantial and long-lasting rescue of photoreceptor structure and transient rescue of photoreceptor physiology .
However , expression shortly before or after this critical period failed to rescue , suggesting that rhodopsin expression during a discrete window of time in development is essential for proper <termsem="GO:0016028"> rhabdomere </term> morphogenesis .
This result is consistent with observations in the rat wherein rhodopsin onset occurs with strict timing in the developmental history of most rods in vivo [ 44 ] .
Thus , through its regulation of rhodopsin levels , or perhaps through control of the kinetics of the up-regulation of rhodopsin beginning at about P6 , Crx may be regulating <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> morphogenesis .
The similarty of the two cases may extend further .
At present , the closest Crx relative in Drosophila is Otd , the founding member of the class of homeobox genes to which Crx belongs .
Interestingly , in one hypomorphic allele of Drosophila otd , otduvi , photoreceptor morphogenesis is also disrupted [ 45 ] .
We found that there are many other genes that are dependent upon Crx .
Those that are expressed at a lower level in the Crx - / - retina , such as rhodopsin and peripherin , comprise many that are either enriched or specific to photoreceptors in their expression [ 35 ] .
They include enzymes that are important in lipid metabolism , protein folding and transport , as well as in other processes that one might envision would be important in building a structure such as the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> .
In situ hybridization using probes from this collection of genes has revealed that some of them have their RNA localized to the <termsem="GO:0001917"> inner segment </term> , a finding typical for proteins targeted to the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> .
Future analyses of the function of these genes might reveal their role in <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> biogenesis .
Finally , polarization of photoreceptors was found to be largely intact , as was ciliogenesis .
Another LCA gene , CRB1 , and a related gene CRB3 , have been implicated in ciliogenesis in in vitro models [ 46 ] .
The Drosophila homologue of CRB1 , Crumbs , has been implicated in photoreceptor morphogenesis [ 47 ] .
However , the spontaneously occurring mouse mutant in CRB1 , the Rd8 mouse , develops shortened <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> that subsequently degenerate [ 48 ] , suggesting that photoreceptor polarization and synaptogenesis are intact in this mutant .
While CRB1 and Crx have been both linked to LCA , further work is necessary to determine if their function is linked in retinal development .
Synaptogenesis is perturbed in Crx - / - photoreceptors .
The Crx - / - mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> reported to date .
The peripherin - / - mouse develops a normal complement of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> which then degenerate as the photoreceptors are lost [ 30 ] .
Also , similarly in rhodopsin ( Rho ) and cyclic nucleotide-gated channel , alpha-3 ( CNGA3 ) double knockout mice ( Rho - / - , CNGA3 - / - ) , <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> are reported to form normally [ 49 ] .
These observations demonstrate that photoreceptor synaptogenesis can occur in the absence of <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation .
In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in peripherin - / - mice , suggesting that minimal phototransduction is present in these mice , enough to drive activity at the photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> .
In vitro studies wherein <termsem="GO:0044456"> <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> elements </term> are formed in the absence of proper <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> development and , therefore , possible absence of light-dependent photoreceptor activity , have indicated the independence of phototransduction and <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> formation , at least for the initial stages [ 50,51 ] .
These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx - / - photoreceptors do not have proper <termsem="GO:0044456"> <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> endings </term> is not due to a lack of <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> formation .
A more likely explanation is that Crx plays a role in photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> formation , perhaps by regulating directly , or indirectly , important genes in this process .
Using immunohistochemistry , we examined the expression of common pre - <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminal </term> proteins , including KIF3a , SV2 , and synaptophysin , and were unable to observe qualitative differences between Crx - / - and control tissue at P14 ( data not shown ) .
Examination of their RNA levels by SAGE showed no significant difference for all 3 genes , though very few tags were recovered from these genes and thus the analysis of RNA levels may not be significant [ 35 ] .
However , since other genes expressed in photoreceptors were significantly altered in their expression level in the Crx - / - mouse , there are many candidates that could be important for photoreceptor morphogenesis .
Tags from three genes from proteins expressed in photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> were found to be decreased in a statistically significant fashion , namely the HGF-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate , the CRIPT protein , and synaptotagmin 1 ( Blackshaw and Cepko , unpublished data ) .
An example of a gene that was increased in the Crx - / - retina is HRG4 ( a homologue of the C. elegans Unc119 gene ) ( Blackshaw and Cepko , unpublished data ) which encodes a component of the ribbon <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> [ 33 ] .
The fact that it is upregulated might indicate a response to the lack of proper <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminal </term> structures .
Several other genes encoding putative <termsem="GO:0005856"> cytoskeletal </term> elements also were increased ( e.g. <termsem="GO:0005874"> microtubule </term> associated protein 4 ) or decreased ( e.g. cofilin 1 ) in the Crx - / - retina , with P values of < .005 .
It is not known whether any of these genes are involved in building or regulating <termsem="GO:0044456"> <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> structures </term> , but they are now genes that might lead to a better understanding of the construction and function of the relatively unique structure of the ribbon <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapse </term> .
Abnormal photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminal </term> formation was noted in a study that examined retinal development in the <termsem="GO:0043256"> laminin </term> beta2 chain-deficient mouse [ 52 ] .
Several pathologies were noted in these mice .
First , <termsem="GO:0043256"> laminin </term> beta2 chain-deficient mice displayed abnormal <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> elongation , but a more mild phenotype than that of the Crx - / - mice ; the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segments </term> were reduced by 50 % in length .
Also photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0043679"> terminals </term> were perturbed in laminin beta2 mutants , but again the phenotype was more subtle then that of Crx - / - mice .
The outer plexiform layer of the beta2-deficient retinas demonstrated only 7 % normal invaginating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> , while the remainder had various pathologies , including floating <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> ribbons , as seen here .
The mechanistic relationship of these two molecules , if any , in photoreceptor morphogenesis is unknown to date .
The mRNA for <termsem="GO:0043256"> laminin </term> beta2 was not detected in the SAGE study of the relative RNA levels in Crx - / - and Crx + / + and thus we can not comment on whether the levels of RNA for <termsem="GO:0043256"> laminin </term> beta2 were altered .
Crx - / - mice are a model for LCA .
Crx has been implicated in three photoreceptor diseases that result in human blindness , cone-rod dystrophy2 , Leber 's congenital amaurosis , and retinitis pigmentosa ( for review , see [ 53 ] ) .
The cone-rod dystrophies ( CRDs ) are characterized by loss of cone-mediated vision in the first decade of life or later , with concomitant or subsequent loss of rod-mediated vision [ 54 ] .
Conversely , RP is notable for initial loss of rod function , followed by loss of cone-mediated vision [ 55 ] .
The majority of known genes responsible for human genetic blindness , encode proteins expressed almost exclusively , or exclusively , in photoreceptors , particularly in the <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> [ 35 ] .
Many of these proteins are required for phototransduction or <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> structure .
The mechanisms whereby mutations in rod-specific genes , such as rhodopsin , lead eventually to cone degeneration in RP remain obscure .
Mutations in Crx were the first , and still one of a very few examples of a transcription factor mutation leading to photoreceptor disease .
LCA is a disease in which there is little or no photoreceptor function in infancy ; thereby , likely developmental in etiology ( [ 17,56 ] for review ) .
The Crx - / - mouse may be an excellent model for studying the pathology of this disorder , particularly the subtype of the disorder where Crx mutations are involved .
The vast majority of histopathological studies of LCA in human tissue have been derived from adult patients with LCA where secondary changes are likely to be present .
Indeed in animal models of LCA , secondary reactive and/or degenerative changes occur early after the abnormal formation of retinal tissue [ 57 ] .
The only study in human tissue derived from a human 33-week retina with proposed RPE65 mutations was reported to have abnormal retinae at this early stage [ 24 ] .
These authors report <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> loss , including thinning of the photoreceptor layer .
In addition , they claim in the text to have seen aberrant <termsem="GO:0045202"> synaptic </term> and inner retinal organization , although their examination of photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0045202"> synapses </term> unfortunately are not presented in the data section of the paper .
Given the scarcity of available human tissue , the characterization of the primary pathology of LCA will require animal models .
In the current study , we present data that argue that , in addition to <termsem="GO:0001750"> outer segment </term> morphogenesis , synaptogenesis may also be critically impaired in at least a subset of LCA .
Crx - / - mice were generated as reported elsewhere [ 34 ] .
Rhodosin-null mice [ 29 ] were obtained from Paul Sieving ( University of Michigan ) .
Rds mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratory .
Littermate Crx - / - and wildtype pups were perfused in 1 % formaldehyde and 0.5 % glutaraldehyde at various postnatal stages .
The eyes were then enucleated , and the cornea and lens were removed .
The eye cup was immersed in fixative ( 1 % formaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde ) for 3 to 4 hours at 4 C .
The sclera was then partially removed and the retinas were sliced into small pieces and fixed ( 1 % paraformaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde ) overnight at 4 C .
These procedures were found optimal for maintaining the structural integrity of the <termsem="GO:0001750"> photoreceptor outer segments </term> .
After fixing , the tissue was washed 2X in PBS for thirty minutes per wash .
