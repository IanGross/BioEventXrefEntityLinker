<termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions of mouse MCM4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
<termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Helicases </term> </term> play central roles in initiation and <termsem="GO:0006271"> elongation of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> </term> .
We previously reported that <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0016887"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ATPase </term> </term> activities of the mammalian Mcm4/6/7 complex are activated specifically by thymine-rich single-stranded DNA .
Here , we examined its substrate preference and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions using various synthetic DNAs .
On a bubble substrate , Mcm4/6/7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the 5  - proximal 25 nt single-stranded segments adjacent to the branch points , presumably <termsem="GO:0022607"> generating </term> double hexamers .
Loss of thymine residues from one single-strand results in significant decrease of <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> efficacy , suggesting that concurrent bidirectional <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> by a single double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 may play a role in efficient <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> of the bubble .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> and <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinds </term> various fork and <termsem="GO:0006271"> extension </term> structures carrying a single-stranded 3  - tail DNA .
The extent of <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation depends on the sequence context of the 3  - tail , and the maximum level is achieved by DNA with 50 % or more thymine content .
<termsem="GO:0000732"> Strand displacement </term> by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited , as the GC content of the duplex region increases .
Replacement of cytosine -- guanine pairs with cytosine -- inosine pairs in the duplex restored <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> , suggesting that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> has difficulties in <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> stably base-paired duplex .
Taken together , these findings reveal important features on activation and substrate preference of the eukaryotic <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicative </term> <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
<termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicases </term> </term> couple the hydrolysis of nucleotide or deoxynucleotide triphosphate to <termsem="GO:0032508"> duplex unwinding </term> ( 1 ) .
Coordination of a set of subactivities including <termsem="GO:0000166"> nucleotide binding </term> , <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> and ATP hydrolysis is required for <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding of duplex DNA </term> ( 1,2 ) .
The hexameric <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicases </term> </term> , to which minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm ) <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> belongs , are known to <termsem="GO:0022607"> assemble </term> a ring-like structure ( 3 -- 5 ) .
Whereas most of <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicases </term> </term> of this group , including simian virus 40 large T-antigen ( 6 ) , Escherichia coli DnaB ( 7 ) and Archaeal Mcm ( 4,8,9 ) , are composed of a single subunit , the active eukaryotic Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicases </term> </term> are composed of two trimeric Mcm4/6/7 proteins ( 10 -- 14 ) .
All the six Mcm 2 -- 7 proteins contain highly conserved <termsem="GO:0008094"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA-dependent ATPase </term> </term> motifs in their central regions ( 15,16 ) .
Among the several stable subcomplexes which MCM proteins can <termsem="GO:0022607"> generate </term> , only the Mcm4/6/7 complex has been shown to possess an intrinsic <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> activity ( 10 -- 14,17 -- 18 ) .
While Mcm4 , Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins make distinct contribution to its <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity ( 11 -- 13 ) , Mcm2 or Mcm3/5 inhibit the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity of the Mcm4/6/7 complex by converting its double trimer structure into a heterotetramer or heteropentamer , respectively ( 3,11 ) .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and genetic characterization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strongly suggested that Mcm is involved not only in initiation but also in the <termsem="GO:0022616"> DNA chain elongation stage </term> as a <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicative </term> <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> ( 19,20 ) .
Consistent with this notion , the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse Mcm4/6/7 complexes is significantly stimulated on forked DNA structures and it can <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwind </term> duplex DNA of 400 -- 500 bp ( 13,14 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to fork and bubble structures in an ATP-dependent manner , and <termsem="GO:0022607"> generates </term> a double-hexameric complex , as was shown for T-antigen ( 13,14,21 ) .
Recently , we reported that the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> and ATP hydrolysis activities of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 are specifically activated by single-stranded DNA containing stretches of thymine residues and proposed a novel model that Mcm may play a crucial role in selection of <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origins in higher eukaryotes ( 13 ) .
In this report , in order to clarify the mode of action of the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> and obtain insight into how it may function at the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> forks in vivo , we have conducted detailed analyses of <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> action and <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> of mouse Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> using various forked and bubble substrate DNAs .
We specifically addressed sequence requirement for the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation , mode of interaction with DNA substrates and whether the thymine sequences are required for continuous activation of Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> during the <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding process </term> .
The results indicate that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 primarily <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to single-stranded DNA region , and that the extent of <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation is related to the thymine content of the single-stranded segment .
Unexpectedly , Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> is not capable of efficiently <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> the GC-rich duplex segment , suggesting that some other mechanism may be required for completion of <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> of the entire genome .

<termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> and gel shift assays .

<termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Nuclease </term> </term> protection assays .
The reaction mixtures ( 25 l ) contained 25 mM HEPES -- NaOH ( pH 7.5 ) , 50 mM sodium acetate , 10 mM Mg ( CH3COO ) 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0.25 mg/ml BSA , 0.5 mM ATP--S , 0.5 mM CaCl2 , 10 fmol of 32P-labeled bubble substrate , and the indicated amount of Mcm4/6/7 proteins .
After incubation at 30 C for 30 min , the indicated amount of <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> ( TAKARA Biomedical , Japan ) was added , and the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 min .
<termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> was inactivated by the addition of 250 l of stop solution ( 20 mM EDTA , 0.2 M sodium chloride , 1 % SDS and 12.5 g/ml yeast RNA ) .
For <termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> nuclease </term> </term> P1 footprinting assay , <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding reactions </term> were carried out under the same conditions except that CaCl2 was omitted .

Mcm4/6/7 complex primarily interacts with the single-stranded DNA segment .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to ` bubble ' DNA substrates and <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinds </term> the duplex segments when the central single-stranded segment contains thymine stretches ( 13 ) .
In order to examine the mode of binding of Mcm4/6/7 on bubble DNAs , we conducted <termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> nuclease </term> </term> protection assays using labeled bubble substrate DNAs and Mcm4/6/7 in the presence of ATP--S which permits binding to substrate DNA but does not mobilize the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
At an optimum concentration of <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> , strong cleavages were detected on the 21 bp duplex regions at both ends of the substrates , whereas weaker cleavages were detected on the central single-stranded region , consistent with preference of <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> to double-stranded DNA .
With the Bub66/T-rich substrate , strong protection was detected on the entire single-stranded regions of both top and bottom strands with increasing concentration of Mcm4/6/7 , consistent with high affinity of Mcm4/6/7 to T-rich bubble sequences ( Figure 1A ) .
Similar , but less significant protection was detected on the single-stranded DNA segment with P1 <termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> nucleases </term> </term> ( Figure 1A ) , which is specific to single-stranded DNA .
The results indicate that the Mcm complex is loaded onto bubble DNA through <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to both strands of the single-stranded region .
Careful examination of Mcm4/6/7 footprints on a bubble indicated strong protection on the 5  - half of the top strand and moderate protection on the remaining 3  - half , as well as on several base-pair duplex segment adjacent to the branch point ( Figure 1A and data not shown ) .
A similar pattern of protection was observed also on the bottom strand .
This suggests that Mcm4/6/7 may <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to a <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> bubble substrate with a 2-fold symmetry as a double hexamer ( Figure 1A , see the lower scheme ) , in a manner similar to SV40 T-antigen ( 21 ) .
<termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Nuclease </term> </term> protection assays were conducted also on a T-tailed Y-fork structure ( Figure 1B ) .
Not only the single-stranded tail region but also the 7 bp duplex DNA adjacent to the duplex-to-single-strand junction were protected by Mcm <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> from <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNaseI </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0009056"> digestion </term> .
These results indicate that Mcm4/6/7 protein primarily interacts with single-stranded DNA region and that the interaction also spans the duplex segments near the branchpoint of the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> fork .
Formation of double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 complexes facilitates <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions on bubble substrates .
The above results suggest that Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0022607"> generates </term> a double hexameric complex on a bubble , each hexamer of which makes symmetric contact with the 5  - proximal central single-stranded segment .
This predicts that the single-stranded segment needs to be of a sufficient length in order to accommodate the Mcm complex .
In fact , we previously showed that the Mcm4/6/7 mainly <termsem="GO:0022607"> forms </term> a single hexameric complex on bubble-20 ( a bubble substrate with 20 nt long central single-stranded segment ) and a double hexameric complex on bubble-60 DNA ( 13 ) .
In order to determine the minimum requirement for double-hexamer <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> , a set of synthetic bubble-like substrates ( Bub-T10 , Bub-T20 , Bub-T30 , Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 ) that differed in the length of the central unpaired segment were <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> , and the <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activities of Mcm4/6/7 on these substrates were examined .
Mcm4/6/7 was incubated with a radiolabeled synthetic bubble substrate in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP--S to allow <termsem="GO:0065003"> complex formation </term> .
A half of these reaction mixtures were analyzed for <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> in gel shift assays ( Figure 2A ) , and the remainder was further incubated in the presence of 10 mM ATP to measure <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> activity ( Figure 2B ) .
Bub-10 generated only a low level of complexes with Mcm4/6/7 , and Bub-20 <termsem="GO:0022607"> generated </term> primarily a single mobility-shifted form , which may contain a single hexamer of Mcm4/6/7 .
On Bub-30 , significant amount of complexes containing a double hexamer were <termsem="GO:0022607"> generated </term> in addition to those containing a single hexamer ( Figure 2A ) ( 13,21 ) .
The amounts of double hexamer complexes increased on Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 with concomitant decrease of single hexamer complexes ( Figure 2A ) .
The results indicate that a single-stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient loading of the double-hexameric Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> on a bubble substrate .
In <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> assays , Mcm4/6/7 complex did not show <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity on either Bub-10 or Bub-20 substrate .
The efficiency of <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> slightly improved as the length of the single-stranded segment increased up to 30 nt .
On Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 , on the other hand , significant <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> was observed , indicating that a single-stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions on bubble substrates ( Figure 2B ) .
Taken together , the above results are consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 complex , loaded onto DNA as a double hexameric complex , efficiently <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinds </term> the duplex region of the substrate DNA .
Both strands of thymine-rich single-stranded segments are required for efficient unwinding of bubble DNA by Mcm4/6/7 .
Symmetric binding of the Mcm4/6/7 double hexamer to bubble suggests that each hexamer catalyzes unwinding of one of the two duplex segments .
We asked whether activation of both hexamers is required for <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> of the bubble substrate .
The preferred bubble substrate which is efficiently <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> by Mcm4/6/7 contains thymine stretches on both strands of the single-stranded segment .
We <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> a hetero-bubble ( Bub66/T -- G-rich ) in which one strand is T-rich ( same as Bub66/T-rich ) and the other strand is G-rich ( same as Bub66/G-rich ) ( 13 ) , and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> assays were conducted with increasing amount of Mcm4/6/7 .
Only weak <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> was detected on this substrate compared to Bub66/T-rich ( Figure 3A ) .
Since Mcm4/6/7 can <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to Bub66/T -- G-rich and <termsem="GO:0022607"> forms </term> a double hexameric complex ( data not shown ) , the defective <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> is not due to inefficient loading of the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> onto the substrate .
If one hexamer interacting with the thymine-rich strand dissociates from the other hexamer and <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaces </term> only one of the duplex segments , then it would result in generation of Y-fork structures which could not be further <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> due to the presence of G-rich 3  - tail and would appear on the gel .
However , we did not detect such intermediates during the course of the experiment ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that bubble can be <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> efficiently only when two molecules of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamers are simultaneously activated .

In order to examine more precisely the interaction and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions with forked substrates , Y-fork substrates containing a nascent leading strand ( A-fork [ 3  ] ) , nascent lagging strand ( A-fork [ 5  ] ) , or both of them ( A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] ) , as well as <termsem="GO:0006273"> 5  - extension </term> or <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> structures were <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to A-fork [ 3  ] or A-fork [ 5  ] with affinity similar to that of a simple Y-fork ( Figure 4A and data not shown ) .
In contrast , PriA <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> , used as a control , <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to A-fork [ 3  ] more efficiently than to A-fork [ 5  ] , as reported previously ( 23,25 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> also to <termsem="GO:0006273"> 5  - extension </term> and <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> , albeit with slightly reduced affinity compared to A-fork [ 3  ] and A-fork [ 5  ] ( Figure 4A ) .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] with much lower affinity , and the complex gave rise to a single band .
These findings indicate that the Mcm4/6/7 complex is loaded onto DNA preferentially and efficiently through single-stranded region , regardless of the presence of 3  - or 5  - terminus .
In contrast , only the substrate containing a 3  single-stranded DNA tail ( A-fork [ 5  ] ) was efficiently <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> and A-fork [ 3  ] or A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] , was not <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> by Mcm4/6/7 ( Figure 4B ) .
Absence of <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions on A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] composed only of duplex regions is expected since double-stranded DNA is not able to activate the <termsem="GO:0016887"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ATPase </term> </term> activity of Mcm4/6/7 ( 10 ) .
In contrast , the PriA , a structure-specific <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> used as a control , <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> at the fork junction and <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinds </term> the fork and the nascent lagging strand DNA on A-fork [ 5  ] , or <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinds </term> the nascent lagging strand on A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] , as reported before ( 25 ) .
These results indicate that the Mcm4/6/7 complex <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to single-stranded DNA and that its <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> is activated only in the presence of a single-stranded 3  - tail .
<termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> with poly ( dT ) tail is <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> by Mcm4/6/7 .
It has been reported that the <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> can be <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> by the archaeal Mcm homohexamer but not by <termsem="GO:0043093"> fission </term> and <termsem="GO:0007114"> budding </term> yeast Mcm complexes ( 14,26,27 ) .
We have <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> substrates containing poly ( dT ) , poly ( dA ) , poly ( dC ) and poly ( dG ) 3  - tails in order to examine whether mouse Mcm4/6/7 can <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> these substrates .
We first found that Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to dT - , dC - and dG - <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> with similar affinity , and to dA - <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> with much lower affinity ( Figure 5A ) .
This is consistent with the previous results that Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to 50mer oligo-dT , - dC and - dG , but not to a 50mer oligo-dA ( 13 ) .
We found that dT-tailed <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> was <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> efficiently by Mcm 4/6/7 while almost no or very little activity was detected on other substrates ( Figure 5B and C ) .
This is in sharp contrast to yeast Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicases </term> </term> which are not capable of <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> substrates .
Furthermore , dT-tailed <termsem="GO:0006273"> 5  - extension </term> , to which Mcm4/6/7 could <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> , was not <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> by the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
The addition of the 5  - tail to dT-tailed <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> further stimulated the <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> ( Figure 5D ) , confirming the previous report that the fork structures facilitate the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> action .
Thus , these results further strengthen our conclusion that the mammalian Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> is generally activated by the thymine-stretch on the 3  - single-stranded tail .
The effects of the thymine content of the 3  - tail on Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity .
We next examined more systematically the effect of the compositions of the thymine residues of the 3  - tail on the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity .
A partial heteroduplex M13 single-stranded DNA containing a 37 bp duplex region in the presence or absence of the 50 nt long 3  - tail of various nucleotide compositions were <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> and the <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> by mouse Mcm4/6/7 was examined ( Figure 6A ) .
Due to its low processivity , Mcm4/6/7 barely <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> the <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> annealed </term> </term> 37mer oligonucleotide without a 3  - tail ( 37mer ; Figure 6A ) .
Only weak <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity was observed on the substrate carrying the 3  - tail of 25 repeats of TA dinucleotide ( 37-TA25 ; Figure 6A ) , whereas strong <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity was observed on 37-TTA17 .
Increase of thymine content on the 3  - tail did not further increase the extent of <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> ( 37-TTTA13 , 37-TTTTA10 and 37-T50 ; Figure 6A ) , suggesting that 17 repeats of TT dinucleotides ( 67 % thymine ) may be sufficient for activation of Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
It should be noted that the TA25 tail would self - <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> anneal </term> </term> and this would prevent the loading of Mcm , since the 3  - tail containing TTAA13 or TTTAAA8 did not <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhance </term> the <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> either ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we next examined the effects of repeating sequences of thymine and cytosine ( Figure 6B ) .
Partial heteroduplex substrates containing the 3  - tail of TC25 , TTCC13 , TTTCCC8 , TTTTCCCC6 , TTCC17 were <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> by the Mcm4/6/7 complex to the extent similar to that achieved by TTA17 , suggesting that 50 % thymine content is sufficient for full activation of Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
TTCC13 and TTCC17 were <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> to a similar extent , consistent with the earlier result that a 40 nt tail is sufficient for activation ( 13 ) .
However , the efficiency of the <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> significantly decreased as the thymine content of the 3  - tail dropped to 33 % , as in TAA17 or TCC17 ( Figure 6B and C ) .
Thus , the minimal thymine content required for activation of the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> may be somewhere between 33 and 50 % .
DUE sequences from the c-myc origin activate Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing periodic ( dT ) n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin ( 48 % thymine content ) can serve as an efficient activator for the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> on a bubble , and replacement of thymines with guanines abolished the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation ( 13,28 ) .
In order to examine other natural <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origins with different thymine contents for the ability to activate Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> on a bubble substrate , we <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> new bubble substrates , Bub82/c-myc , containing sequences derived from the DUE ( <termsem="GO:0032508"> DNA unwinding </term> element ) region of the human c-myc origin which is essential for c-myc replicator activity ( 29,30 ) .
The unpaired segment in Bub82/c-myc/DUE contains one strand of DUE and that in Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C contains another strand .
This DUE is believed to coincide with the initially <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> region of the c-myc origin ( 29 ) , and its deletion substantially reduced the replicator activity ( 30 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> Bub82/lamin B2 ( thymine 48 % ) , Bub82/c-myc/DUE ( 37 % ) and Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C ( 39 % ) with similar efficiency ( Figure 7A ) , indicating that the sequences from the c-myc origin also can serve as efficient activators of the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
This result also indicates that sequences with 37 % thymine content can activate Mcm4/6/7 to <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> 24 nt duplex on both sides in a bubble substrate , suggesting that the not only thymine content but also the sequence context may affect the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation .
In gel shift assays , MCM4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to all the three bubbles , although the affinity to Bub82/c-myc/DUE and to Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C is slightly lower than that to Bub-82 / lamin B2 ( Figure 7B ) .
Therefore , <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> activities do not necessarily correlate with each other .
This was also indicated by our previous results that guanine and cytosine stretches can <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to Mcm but can not activate the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> ( 13 ) .
<termsem="GO:0032508"> DNA unwinding </term> by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited by the GC-rich sequences on the duplex segment .
Our results indicate that thymine-rich single-stranded DNA is required for initial loading and activation of the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
However , it is not known whether thymine sequences are required for processive <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding of duplex DNA </term> .
Therefore , we have examined whether the nucleotide composition of the duplex region affects its <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding activity </term> .
To address this issue , we <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> a series of T-tailed Y-fork structures ( T-fork ) containing various sequences in the duplex segment .
They carried varied contents of cytosine residues on the 3  - tail strand .
In gel shift assays , Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to these Y-fork substrates with identical affinity ( Figure 8A ) , consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to single-stranded tails .
However , in <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> assays , T-fork / ( C : G ) 49 was hardly <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> by Mcm4/6/7 , but was readily <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> by SV40 T-antigen <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> ( Figure 8B ) .
When thymine or adenine is inserted as every third nucleotide ( repeats of CCT or CCA ) , the extent of <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> increased ( T-fork / ( CCT : GGA ) 16 and T-fork / ( CCA : GGT ) 16 ) .
The efficiency of <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> is roughly correlated with the content of GC pairs in the duplex segment [ T-fork / ( CCAA : GGTT ) 12 , T-fork / ( CCTT : GGAA ) 12 , T-fork / ( CAAA : GTTT ) 12 and T-fork / ( CTTT : GAAA ) 12 ; Figure 8B ] .
It appears that the duplex segment containing < 50 % GC pairs is efficiently <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> ( Figure 8C ) .
We next examined the effect of GC-rich segments on a partial heteroduplex DNA on a single-stranded circular DNA .
We have <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> two sets of 5  - tailed partial heteroduplex DNA substrates containing duplex regions of variable lengths ; one on M13mp18 vector and the other on M13mp19 containing a 66 nt long G-rich segment downstream of the <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridizing </term> </term> oligonucleotide .
We found that the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> can <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> duplex DNA up to 350 nt long on its own on the former substrate ( Figure 8D , left ) , consistent with previous results ( 13 ) .
In contrast , <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> was inhibited over the GC-rich segments on the latter substrate ( Figure 8D , right panel ) , although <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> up to 250 nt in length , albeit at a reduced level , was observed at a high concentration of Mcm4/6/7 complex .
This result is consistent with that on Y-fork and indicates that GC-rich duplex segment is inhibitory for <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> by the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
These results may indicate that the presence of thymine -- adenine pairs with a certain frequency in the duplex region may facilitate continuous <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> by Mcm4/6/7 .
Alternatively , Mcm4/6/7 is not efficient enough to <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> thermodynamically stable GC-base-paired segment .
In order to distinguish these two possibilities , we designed a new T-fork substrate containing inosine ( I ) residue instead of guanosine residue .
The thermal stability of the I : C base pair is lower than that of the G : C base pair in duplex DNA due to loss of one hydrogen bond and is even lower than A : T base pair ( 31 ) .
We <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> the T-tailed fork substrates containing the ( GCC : CGG ) 10 , ( GCC : CIG ) 10 or ( GAA : CTT ) 10 duplex DNA segment ( Figure 8E ) .
Mcm4/6/7 hardly <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> the 31 nt long duplex of GCC : CGG repeats , whereas the T-fork / ( GAA : CTT ) 10 was <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> efficiently , as described above .
T-fork / ( GCC : CIG ) 10 was <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> with efficiency much greater than that of T-fork / ( GCC : CGG ) 10 , indicating that the thermostability of the duplex segment , not the lack of AT base pair , is responsible for inability of Mcm4/6/7 to <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> the duplex .
<termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> is a central factor for operation of <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> forks .
It also plays a crucial role in the initiation step at the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origins .
Therefore , the elucidation of how the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicative </term> <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicases </term> </term> interact with DNA substrate and how they are activated is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of <termsem="GO:0006270"> initiation of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> </term> .
It is now believed that Mcm is a major component of the eukaryotic <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicative </term> <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
In this report , we have conducted detailed analyses on <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions of mouse Mcm4/6/7 using various substrates including fork and bubble structures .
Modes of <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> and activation of Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> on a bubble structure .
<termsem="GO:0006270"> Initiation of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> </term> is associated with localized <termsem="GO:0032508"> melting of duplex DNA </term> near <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origins .
<termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Helicases </term> </term> are loaded onto <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> forks through the <termsem="GO:0032508"> melted </term> region , induced by initiator <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> , in bacteria ( 32 ) .
We previously reported that Mcm4/6/7 can be loaded onto a bubble-like structure and can serve as a <termsem="GO:0003678"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNA helicase </term> </term> at the forks ( 13 ) .
The ability of Mcm4/6/7 to <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwind </term> the bubble substrate but not the conventional duplex DNA ( Figures 2 and 13 ) indicates that Mcm can be loaded through the single-stranded segment of the bubble .
Furthermore , the Mcm4/6/7 complex displays marked preference for thymine-rich sequences within the single-stranded segment for <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation ( 13 ) .
The results in this report indicate that <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> action of Mcm4/6/7 on synthetic bubbles may depend on the presence of an unpaired region of sufficient length ( at least 40 nt ) , which may permit assembly of a double-hexameric complex on the substrate DNA , similar to SV40 T-antigen protein ( Figure 2A ) ( 21 ) .
When one strand of the single-stranded segment in T-rich bubble was replaced by guanine-rich sequences , the efficiency of <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> was significantly reduced .
Our footprinting analyses showed that Mcm4/6/7 strongly protects 25 nt single-stranded DNA segment adjacent to each branch point and proximal to 5  ends of both strands of the bubble .
At each fork , one Mcm4/6/7 complex is likely to encircle the single-stranded DNA strand and two hexamers may <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> symmetrically to the bubble substrate , <termsem="GO:0022607"> forming </term> a double hexameric structure on the bubble ( see schematic drawing of Figure 1A ) .
Efficient <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> into both directions may require simultaneous activation of both hexamers which may sit at the center while extruding the <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> single-stranded DNA through the rings .
This may closely resemble the proposed modes of <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> and <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions of T-antigen ( 21 ) .
Although we can not totally exclude the possibility that one Mcm4/6/7 hexamer at each fork <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinds </term> the duplex independently , ring-shaped structures of mouse and archea MCM , as revealed by electron microscopy , bear much similarity to the recently solved structure of the SV40 large T-antigen ( 4,6 ) , and are in favor of the double-hexameric structure of mouse Mcm on a bubble DNA .
Substrate and sequence requirement for Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation .
<termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> assays indicate that Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to those substrates containing single-stranded DNA regions regardless of the presence or absence of single-stranded 3  or 5  end .
Unwinding of the duplex DNA depends on translocation of single-stranded DNA from 3  to 5  direction .
This is most clearly shown by its <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> action on A-fork [ 5  ] and <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> but not on A-fork [ 3  ] , A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] nor <termsem="GO:0006273"> 5  - extension </term> .
However , it does not necessarily require 3  end of single-stranded DNA , since Mcm4/6/7 can <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> annealing </term> </term> oligonucleotide on a circular single-stranded DNA .
The ability of the mouse Mcm4/6/7 to <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwind </term> <termsem="GO:0006272"> 3  - extension </term> is shared by the archaeal Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> but not by Mcm4/6/7 from S.pombe and S.cerevisiae ( 14,26,27 ) .
The archaeal Mcm can <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwind </term> A-fork [ 3  ] but eukaryotic Mcm4/6/7 can not , since the former <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to double-stranded DNA but the latter does not ( 5,27 ) .
While yeast Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicases </term> </term> can translocate on duplex DNA , such activity was not observed with mammalian Mcm4/6/7 ( data not shown ) .
Occurrence of AT-rich sequences , with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine , near the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origins , lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> , and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origins to activate Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
Both lamin-B2 and c-myc origins served as efficient activator for Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> in vitro .
Consistent with it , site-specific loading of Mcm in the <termsem="GO:0006270"> <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> initiation </term> zone of the c-myc was recently reported ( 33 ) .
We have examined in detail the effect of sequence context of the single-stranded DNA on the <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity of Mcm .
The results indicate that thymine content of 50 % is sufficient for the maximum <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity .
The efficiency of <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> decreased as the thymine content of the 3  - tail dropped to 33 % ( Figure 6 ) .
The stretches of thymine residues may not be necessarily required , since repeats of TC dinucleotides served as a potent activator for Mcm4/6/7 .
We also noticed that the presence of a secondary structure within the single-stranded DNA is inhibitory for <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> action .
<termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Nuclease </term> </term> footprinting assays indicated that <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> was interfered by the secondary structure ( data not shown ) .
Thus , we have concluded that Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> is most efficiently activated by non-structured single-stranded DNA with thymine content of 50 % or more , although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7 ) , suggesting that the sequence specificity for Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context .
This would be reasonable given the flexibility and differential <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of site selection for <termsem="GO:0006270"> initiation of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> </term> during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> or in various cell types , as well as the variability in initiation potential of each <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> origin on the genome even within the single cell type .
Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> during processive <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> at the fork .
The specific requirement of single-stranded thymine residues for activation of Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> prompted us to examine whether they are required also for processive <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding of duplex DNA </term> .
Our results indicated that increase of GC pair in the duplex segment significantly inhibited the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity .
Duplex DNA composed only of GC pairs ( 10 repeats of CGG ) on a Y-fork was not <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> at all , while the same template was readily <termsem="GO:0000732"> displaced </term> by SV40 T-antigen ( Figure 8B ) .
Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> was inhibited by the presence of GC-rich duplex segment also on a circular single-stranded partial heteroduplex substrate .
However , on this substrate , Mcm4/6/7 was able to <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> DNA past the GC-rich region , albeit to a limited extent , when it was added at a high concentration .
On the partial heteroduplex template , Mcm is loaded onto the circular single-stranded DNA of 6.4 kb , while it is loaded onto the 50 nt long 3  - tail DNA on the Y-fork .
Thus , the difference of <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> actions may reflect the efficiency of Mcm loading .
Alternatively , the presence of ` random ' sequence at the initially <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwound </term> duplex segment in the former template may engage the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> in a more active conformation which can <termsem="GO:0000732"> displace </term> the GC-rich duplex segment .
On Y-fork substrates , increase of AT base pairs in the duplex ( 10 repeats of CTT ) restored the <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> .
These results indicate either that thymine residues are required on the duplex DNA for continuous <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> , or that Mcm4/6/7 is simply not efficient enough to <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwind </term> the stable GC pairs .
Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG repeat duplex DNA resulted in <termsem="GO:0000732"> displacement </term> ( Figure 8E ) ( 31 ) , suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may not be essential for the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> function and that the thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> action of Mcm4/6/7 .
The results described in this manuscript reveal potentially important features of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> , which is likely to be a key component of the eukaryotic <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicative </term> <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> .
Prior to <termsem="GO:0006270"> initiation of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> </term> , Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> may adopt a double hexameric complex at the partially <termsem="GO:0032508"> melted </term> origin region , and may catalyze concurrent <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding of duplex DNA </term> into both directions , while stably associated with the origins of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> .
This is similar to the T-antigen model originally proposed by Smelkova and Borowiec ( 21 ) .
We propose that , only when both hexamers are activated by the interacting thymine-rich sequences present within the <termsem="GO:0032508"> melted </term> region , the Mcm <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> is mobilized and initiation takes place .
A crucial question is how these double hexameric <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> complexes are <termsem="GO:0022607"> generated </term> and turn into active <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicases </term> </term> at the origins .
This process would involve <termsem="GO:0032508"> melting of duplex DNA </term> , which may be facilitated by <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> of preRC components in the context of proper chromatin structures , or by other <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> factors including a <termsem="GO:0003916"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> topoisomerase </term> </term> or a newly identified Mcm8 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> ( 34 -- 36 ) .
It may also require association of fork-assisting proteins such as Cdc45 ( 37,38 ) as well as <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylation events </term> by Cdk and Cdc7 kinases ( 39,40 ) .
One unexpected finding of this study is low <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> activity of Mcm4/6/7 on GC-rich duplex DNA .
This , in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> , strongly indicates that the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicative </term> <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> at the <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> forks would require more than Mcm4/6/7 complex .
During the processive <termsem="GO:0032508"> unwinding </term> of duplex <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> forks , Mcm4/6/7 may be further stimulated by interaction with other proteins , including remaining Mcm subunits , Cdc45 ( 37,38 ) , GINS ( 41,42 ) , DNA polymerase subunits ( 43 ) , Mcm8 ( 35,36 ) , etc. to become a truly processive and potent <termsem="GO:0004386"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> helicase </term> </term> capable of <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicating </term> the entire genome .
