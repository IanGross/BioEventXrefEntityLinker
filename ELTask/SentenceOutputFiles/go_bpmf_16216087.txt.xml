<termsem="GO:0048518"> Enhanced </term> Odor Discrimination and Impaired <termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> by Spatially <termsem="GO:0065007"> Controlled </term> Switch of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPA Receptors </term> </term> .
Genetic perturbations of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> ) are widely used to dissect molecular mechanisms of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> coding , <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
In this study , we investigated the role of Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in <termsem="GO:0042048"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> behavior </term> .
<termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> modification was obtained by depletion of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B subunit or <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of unedited <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) , both leading to increased Ca2 + permeability of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> .
Mice with this functional <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> switch , specifically in forebrain , showed <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination and more rapid <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> in a go/no-go <termsem="GO:0035106"> operant conditioning </term> task .
<termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , however , was dramatically impaired .
<termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion in forebrain was ectopically variable ( `` mosaic '' ) among individuals and strongly correlated with decreased <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> in hippocampus and cortex .
Accordingly , <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> was rescued by transgenic <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> restricted to piriform cortex and hippocampus , while <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination was independent of both <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B variability and transgenic <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Thus , correlated differences in <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavior </term> and levels of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> allowed a mechanistic and spatial dissection of <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> , discrimination , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> capabilities .
The <termsem="GO:0007608"> sense of smell </term> is of paramount importance for rodents [ 1 ] , for which rapid odor discrimination and long-lasting <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> memory permits <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> to predator and prey critical for survival .
Consequently , the <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> analyses of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> capabilities in rodents are efficient , quantitative , and reproducible [ 2 -- 4 ] .
While in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and storage of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> piriform cortex [ 5 -- 7 ] , hippocampus [ 8,9 ] , and <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb [ 10 -- 12 ] are all implicated , the cellular correlates for these processes have not been clearly delineated .
The contribution of the hippocampus to <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> is presently controversial [ 2,13 -- 18 ] , but is deemed unlikely for simple <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination tasks [ 9,19 ] .
In fact , the most likely candidates for a cellular correlate of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> appear to be the neuronal connections in the piriform cortex due to the associational connectivity [ 5 ] and the expression of several forms of cellular and synaptic plasticity [ 7,20 -- 23 ] .
Concerning odor discrimination itself , <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular mechanisms </term> for this process are often attributed to the inhibitory circuitry of the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb ( [ 24 -- 30 ] ; reviewed in [ 31 -- 33 ] ) .
Lateral inhibitory circuits were postulated , in analogy to retina [ 34,35 ] , to mediate contrast enhancement [ 24 ] , for which physiological recordings [ 24,36,37 ] and modeling data , based on the well-known anatomy [ 29 ] , provide additional support .
Such contrast enhancement may rest in large part on the particular properties of dendrodendritic synapses between the principal output neurons ( mitral cells ) and local inhibitory neurons ( granule cells ) of the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb .
In these distinct synapses , lateral and recurrent inhibition mediated by the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A system may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> by the activity of the closely appositioned glutamatergic part , perhaps triggering increased <termsem="GO:0014051"> gamma-aminobutyric acid release </term> by Ca2 + influx through <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutamate-gated receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> ( [ 38 ] ; see also [ 39 ] ) .
Given that neuronal circuits underlying odor discrimination , as well as <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , rely on properties of fast excitatory <termsem="GO:0019226"> neurotransmission </term> mediated by <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> ) , we sought to alter , by genetic means , the specific functional contribution of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate ( AMPA ) <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> containing the dominant subunit <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B. Of the four <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> constituents , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - A to D ( GluR1 to 4 ) , which <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> tetrameric <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> with different binary subunit combinations , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B is contained in the majority of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> .
<termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B is critically involved in the <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> and <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> , and dominates their <termsem="GO:0006811"> ion conductance </term> and gating properties [ 40 -- 46 ] .
Notably , the normally low Ca2 + permeability of AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> in principal neurons is solely mediated by <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , due to a unique arginine residue ( R587 ) in the functionally critical glutamine/arginine ( Q/R ) site of the <termsem="GO:0046931"> <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> pore </term> </term> - forming </term> segment M2 [ 44,47,48 ] , resulting from <termsem="GO:0009451"> RNA editing </term> of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B pre-mRNA ( [ 49 ] ; reviewed in [ 50 ] ) .
Hence , either <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B deficiency , or the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Q/R site-unedited <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B with a glutamine residue at the critical <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channel </term> </term> site , leads to increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> , as amply demonstrated in gene-targeted mice [ 51,53,58,60 ] .
Thus , the absence of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , or the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , may generate increased inhibition in mitral cells .
Moreover , the ablation of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , but also changes in the extent of Q/R site <termsem="GO:0043412"> editing </term> of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , can alter the strength of excitatory <termsem="GO:0007268"> synaptic transmission </term> in the genetically addressed neuronal populations [ 51,58,60 ] , thus potentially shifting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory <termsem="GO:0007268"> transmission </term> in the affected circuits .
Similarly , changes in synaptic plasticity due to Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> [ 51,52,60 ] , e.g. , in piriform cortex , might alter odor <termsem="GO:0007613"> memorization processes </term> .
Thus , alterations of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> properties in these brain regions will allow investigation and possibly separation of mechanisms underlying these <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> traits .
Concerning this intended switch in <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> properties , mice lacking all <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , however , show a widespread impairment in <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavior </term> , including lethargy , <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination problems , and deficits in exploratory activity [ 51 ] , which preclude detailed <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> analyses .
Similarly , mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> ( in the entire brain ) a substantial part of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B population in the Q/R site-unedited form become seizure-prone and <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> prematurely [ 53 ] .
Some of these problems can be partially overcome by use of spatially and temporally restricted <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> systems [ 54 -- 56 ] , in particular the Cre-lox system , with Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in defined brain areas of gene-targeted mice carrying <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B alleles marked by loxP sites for Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> [ 55,57 ] .
Indeed , restricting the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Q/R site-unedited <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B to forebrain resulted in almost normal lifespan and an only weakly seizure-prone phenotype [ 58 ] .
Mice with forebrain-specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion appeared almost completely normal throughout life with no <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities , thus permitting a detailed , quantitative investigation of <termsem="GO:0042048"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> behavior </term> .
To allow for the mechanistic separation of <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> , discrimination , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , we exploited a well-known phenomenon of transgenes , which concerns heterogeneous <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> among different founder lines and even among genetically identical individuals of a given line .
Although such `` mosaic '' <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is usually undesired , here we took advantage of it by ablating <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B via gene-targeted , floxed <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B alleles with the help of a transgenic mouse line with variegated Cre <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in forebrain .
By correlating <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfaction </term> - related brain regions with quantitative <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> data , we investigated the dependence on <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
Moreover , to delineate the brain areas involved in these distinctive <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> processes we used transgenic `` rescue '' of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ablation , specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus .
These efforts allowed us to dissect , both spatially and mechanistically , the role of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-mediated <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> properties in selected brain regions in <termsem="GO:0008355"> odor learning </term> , discrimination , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
<termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> in the Forebrain Increases <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> Learning </term> and Discrimination .
To explore the role of fast excitatory <termsem="GO:0019226"> neurotransmission </term> carried by <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-containing AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> processes , we first analyzed mice that <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> part of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B population in a Q/R site-unedited form ( Figure 1A ; termed `` <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB '' ; see also [ 58 ] ) .
These mice carry , in addition to a wild-type <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B allele , a gene-targeted <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - Bneo allele in which the intronic sequence critical for <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0016556"> pre-mRNA editing </term> at the Q/R site is replaced by a floxed <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> - <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> gene , which severely reduces <termsem="GO:0008380"> splicing </term> of the modified intron and hence attenuates the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - Bneo allele [ 60 ] .
To unsilence the attenuated <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - Bneo allele , specifically in the postnatal forebrain , we crossed in the TgCre4 transgene , which encodes Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> and is <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by the CaMKII promoter ( [ 59 ] ; `` Camkcre4 '' ) .
Thus , Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> removes in forebrain neurons the intronic <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> - <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> gene , leading to the active <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS allele for Q/R site-unedited <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) subunits ( Figures 1 and S1 ) .
As expected [ 53,60 ] , also in mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> postnatally forebrain-specific Q/R site-unedited <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) subunits , Ca2 + permeability through <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> was increased and <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> currents showed rectification ( [ 58 ] and unpublished data ) .
<termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB mice had , in contrast to mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) globally , a prolonged lifespan and no severe <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> alterations .
They were however , still seizure-prone [ 58 ] , and hence <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> training was restricted to short periods of time .
We trained six <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB mice and six littermate controls on one odor pair in an automated go/no-go <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0008306"> <termsem="GO:0035106"> conditioning </term> </term> task [ 3,61 ] .
In this task , water-deprived mice are trained to distinguish a water-rewarded odor ( S + ) and an unrewarded odor ( S  ) by their licking <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> ( Figure 1B ) .
Both <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB and control mice acquired the `` simple '' task to discriminate between the monomolecular odors amylacetate and ethylbutyrate ( percentage correct > 70 % after 400 trials ) .
Strikingly , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB mice showed more rapid <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> discrimination capabilities ( Figure 1C , group effect : F ( 1,10 ) = 10.2 , p < 0.01 ) .
This was confirmed by fitting linear trend lines to the initial part of the <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> curve ( slope difference : p < 0.05 ; see Materials and Methods ) .
The training system employed allows for careful monitoring of head positions [ 3 ] .
For rewarded trials ( Figure 1D , green ) , already weakly trained animals kept their head in the sampling port ( large tube in Figure 1B ) during the entire 2-s trial , whereas for unrewarded trials the head is retracted quickly ( Figure 1D , red ) .
The difference of these two curves ( Figure 1E , black ) is a very sensitive assay for discrimination performance ; the fitted maximum of this curve ( Figure 1E , blue ) is referred to as the `` discrimination index '' in the remainder of the paper and is again strongly improved for <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB mice , compared with controls ( Figure 1F ; group effect : F ( 1,10 ) = 11.7 , p < 0.01 ) .
This was not due to general <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> performance , attention , or motivation changes , as both the intertrial interval ( group effect : F ( 1,10 ) = 0.56 , p > 0.4 ) and the overall licking frequency ( group effect : F ( 1,10 ) = 0.72 , p > 0.4 ) were unaffected .
Thus , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in forebrain areas , including the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , resulted in more rapid <termsem="GO:0008355"> odor learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination .
<termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB Mice Exhibit Increased <termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> Discrimination Performance .
To ascertain if <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> and odor discrimination may indeed correlate with the increased Ca2 + permeability of AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> in the Q/R site-unedited form , we next analyzed <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice , which lack <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B in forebrain .
This specific ablation was generated by forebrain-selective TgCre4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( [ 59 ] `` Camkcre4 '' ) in gene-targeted <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox mice carrying , in both <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B alleles , a floxed exon 11 ( Figure 2A ) .
The specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice can be monitored by immunohistochemistry ( see below ) and immunoblotting .
In quantitative immunoblot analyses , we found <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels reduced to 28  7 % , 29  8 % , and 52  9 % (  SEM ; n = 10 ) in the hippocampus , cortical areas , and <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , respectively , relative to <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox littermate controls .
In the absence of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , the electrophysiological properties of AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> become similar to those with <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B / <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) switch [ 51 ] showing strong rectification and increased Ca2 + permeability through AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> ( unpublished data ) .
However , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion is not <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> and does not produce seizures .
In addition , in contrast to the complete <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B knockouts , mice with forebrain-specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion appeared normal throughout life with no <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities , or difference in body size and weight in adulthood ( wild-type : 31.0 g  1.2 ; <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB : 28.4  0.9 ; each n = 10 ) .
Exploratory activity in an open field task was slightly increased in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice ( 3,480 cm  180 , n = 11 ) , compared with wild-type littermates ( 2,512 cm  96 , n = 12 , p < 0.01 ) .
<termsem="GO:0050879"> Motor </term> coordination measured in an accelerating rotarod was somewhat impaired in the mutant mice ( wild-type : 156 s  37 , n = 6 ; <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB : 37 s  10 , n = 6 ; p < 0.05 ) .
Tests in the dark/light box revealed increased anxiety of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice ( latency of first exit : wild-type [ 17 s  3 ] , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB [ 97 s  42 ] , p = 0.047 ; compartment changes : wild-type [ 17 s  3 ] , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB [ 7  2 ] , p < 0.05 ; time spent in lit compartment : wild-type [ 103 s  10 ] , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB [ 59 s  19 ] , p = 0.051 ; each n = 6 ) .
Hence , unlike the complete <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B knockouts , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice show only very minor changes in general activity and no sign of any major <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> disturbance , thus allowing detailed , quantitative <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> investigations .
If the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B / <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) switch-induced alterations in the Ca2 + permeability of the AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> are linked to <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination and learning , the depletion of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B subunit should lead to a similar phenotypic readout .
We therefore trained nine <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice and nine littermate controls in the same automated associative go/no-go <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> conditioning task described above .
To cover even small phenotypic changes in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfaction </term> , we tested different odor pairs , `` simple '' monomolecular odors and `` difficult '' binary mixtures [ 3 ] .
After <termsem="GO:0046959"> habituation </term> , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB and control mice were trained to discriminate between the `` simple '' monomolecular odors amylacetate and ethylbutyrate , and subsequently additionally on a `` difficult '' discrimination task consisting of similar binary mixtures of cineol and eugenol ; and finally again on a `` simple '' discrimination task with the monomolecular odors pelargonic and valeric acid .
Similar to <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice also showed <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and discrimination compared with controls ( Figure 2B ; group effect : F ( 1,16 ) = 6.55 ; p < 0.05 ) .
Increased discrimination performance is expected to show more pronounced effects for closely related odors because of the more challenging `` difficult '' discrimination task that is closer to the psychophysical limits of the system [ 3,4 ] .
Consistent with this notion , differences between <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB and control mice were not only larger if the detailed sampling pattern and discrimination index were investigated ( Figure 2C and 2D , group effect : F ( 1,16 ) = 29.5 ; p < 10  4 ) , but in particular for the discrimination of binary mixtures with similar composition ( group effect : F ( 1,16 ) = 27.8 ; p < 10  4 for the mixture ; FAA EB ( 1,16 ) = 7.0 ; p = 0.02 , and FPel Val ( 1,16 ) = 5.8 ; p = 0.03 for the `` simple '' discrimination tasks ; 3-way ANOVA : F ( 6,96 ) = 2.9 ; p = 0.01 ) .
As activity , measured by the intertrial interval , was not significantly different between genotypes ( F ( 1,16 ) = 3.1 ; p = 0.1 ) , and analysis of the lick frequency showed a tendency to reduced motivation of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice in this particular task ( F ( 1,16 ) = 9.2 ; p < 0.01 ) , we conclude that depletion of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B in forebrain areas indeed resulted in increased <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> and discrimination performances , rather than motivational alterations .
To assess <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfaction </term> specificity , we trained ten <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice and ten controls in a nonolfactory hippocampus-dependent spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> task ( elevated Y-maze ) .
Performance in this task was not improved compared with controls ( Figure S2 ) ; on the contrary , the acquisition of this task was slightly impaired , allowing the conclusion that the <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination performance is likely to be specific to the <termsem="GO:0007608"> sense of smell </term> and possibly related to <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> discrimination capability , rather than a general increase in alertness .
Furthermore , <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhancement </term> in odor discrimination in both <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice makes it likely that improvement in this task results from the common <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> property change mediated by the depletion of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B and the lack of the Q/R site - <termsem="GO:0043412"> edited </term> <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B subunit , both resulting in Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> .
Thus , this suggests that increased Ca2 + influx via <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> leads to <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> and discrimination .
<termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> Is Significantly Decreased but Highly Variable in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB Mice .
To capture the full extent of the role of Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in <termsem="GO:0042048"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> behavior </term> , we next assessed the effects of altered AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> on <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
To probe <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice , six days after the end of the first training phase for odor discrimination ( amylacetate versus ethylbutyrate ) , the training trials for the third odor pair ( pelargonic versus valeric acid ) were interleaved with unrewarded trials in which amylacetate or ethylbutyrate were again presented ( black bar in Figure 2C ) .
Whereas control mice reliably <termsem="GO:0050896"> responded </term> only to the previously rewarded odor ( <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> of 86  8 % , mean  SD , n = 9 , Figure 2E ) , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice showed reduced <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> ( 69  16 % , n = 9 , p < 0.05 , Mann-Whitney ) .
Due to the more rapid <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> observed in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB , one could speculate that a decrease in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> might simply reflect increased extinction .
However , extinction levels were low in general , no significant group-trial interaction could be found for the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> trials ( 2-way ANOVA , F ( 6,90 ) = 1.5 , p > 0.1 ) , and a restriction of the analysis to early <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> trials displayed essentially the same pattern ( Figure S3A ) .
Thus , reduced performance in the probe trials is not due to increased extinction but reflects genuine <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> impairment .
Moreover , because the hippocampus-dependent spatial <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> after-task acquisition in the Y-maze was not affected ( Figure S2 ) , we conclude that the observed <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit is rather specific for <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfaction </term> and does not readily generalize to other modalities .
While the improved odor discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning behavior </term> showed only little variability , the significantly impaired <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performance observed in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice was highly variable among individual animals compared with control littermates ( Figure 2E ) .
This variability in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> was reflected in the level and extent of Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in forebrain of transgenic TgCre4 mice , as visualized by Cre-activity in the Cre-indicator mouse line R26R .
We observed that onset and extent of Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in different forebrain regions varied among individual TgCre4 mice ( Figure 3A ) , which could also be directly visualized by immunohistochemistry with a Cre-antibody ( unpublished data ) .
As this variability persisted after several backcrosses , and Southern blot analysis revealed no differences of transgene integration or number among animals ( Figure 3B ) , it could not be attributed to genetic differences but rather to epigenetic mechanisms .
Hence , we hypothesized that the variability in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> reflected the mosaicism observed in the transgenic TgCre4 line .
The evaluation of regional differences in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern of animals with robust and poor <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> could then be applied to identify brain areas responsible for the observed phenotypes .
<termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> Correlates with Residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B Protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB Mice .
Thus , to examine whether the pronounced variability of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice ( Figure 2E ) reflects variability of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice , we analyzed the residual amount of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B protein in mice with disparate <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performances ( Figure 4A -- C ) .
Notably , mice with pronounced <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficits ( <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> < 70 % ) showed essentially no detectable <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B protein in hippocampus , amygdala , <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , and piriform cortex ( n = 2 , Figure 4B , and unpublished data ) , but mice with almost complete <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> displayed substantial residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in all brain areas investigated ( n = 2 , Figure 4B , and unpublished data ) .
To quantify the relation between residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B protein and <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> experiment was repeated with nine additional <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice and two <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox control animals ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 4A ) , resulting in the same mean , variability , and range of <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performance ( control : 89  10 % ; <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB : 63  14 % ) .
Subsequently , protein was extracted from <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulbs , cortical areas , and hippocampi from each mouse , and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B protein was quantified ( Figure 4C ) .
The summarized correlations are depicted in Figure 4D ( two animals were used for immunofluorescent analysis that yielded the same results as in the first experiment ) .
Whereas no <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> or discrimination-related parameter correlated with residual protein levels ( Figure 4D , R2 < 0.3 ) , a strong correlation between <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B protein was observed in hippocampus ( Figure 4D , R2 = 0.72 , p < 0.003 , n = 10 ) and cortical areas ( Figure 4D , R2 = 0.62 , p < 0.006 , n = 10 ) .
Only a weakly significant correlation was found in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb ( Figure 4D , R2 = 0.48 , p = 0.03 , n = 10 ) .
<termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - A levels were unchanged from wild-type , indicating that compensatory <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of other <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> subunits is unlikely ( <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - A levels relative to control : 1.02  0.05 , mean  SEM , n = 10 ) .
In summary , mice with reduced <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in forebrain areas showed decreased <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , which correlated tightly with a reduction in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in the hippocampus and cortical areas .
<termsem="GO:0048518"> Enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008355"> odor learning </term> and discrimination , on the other hand , was independent of residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb and other forebrain areas , indicating that moderate <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B reductions are sufficient to saturate <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008355"> odor learning </term> and discrimination .
Thus , although both are mediated by <termsem="GO:0043412"> alterations </term> in the <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> subunit <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , due to the qualitatively different dose - <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> curves , the phenotypes regarding <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , and <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> / discrimination must be mechanistically distinct .
Partial Rescue of <termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> Deficit by Selective Transgenic <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> in Hippocampus and Piriform Cortex in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB Mice .
The effect of selective <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion in mice indicated that <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-containing <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in the hippocampus , and/or ( <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> ) cortex are likely to be important for <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
The <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> phenotype could be due to depletion of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> cortex or hippocampus ; <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and discrimination capabilities might rather be evoked by <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> lacking <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb .
To obtain independent evidence for this spatial and mechanistic dissection of the roles of Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> , we <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by transgenic means N-terminally green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B specifically in hippocampus and piriform cortex of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
In accordance with the proposed region-dependence , we expected that additional <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B subunits in hippocampus and/or piriform cortex improve odor <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> but do not alter odor discrimination performance .
The mouse line employed for this purpose , termed <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue , had the genetic background of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice but additionally carried a bidirectional module for <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> and GFPGluR-B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> to the tetracycline - <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> transactivator [ 62 ] .
The transactivator was under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of a modified CaMKII-promoter fragment to obtain high <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> selectivity ( Figure 5A ; see also Materials and Methods ) .
The transgenic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level of GFPGluR-B was 9.72 %  1.25 ( n = 3 ) in the hippocampus , compared with endogenous <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Figure 5C and 5D ) .
Analysis of <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> activity and GFPGluR-B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in brain sections of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue mice revealed <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in hippocampus and piriform cortex , whereas cortex , amygdala , and striatum only rarely showed any positive cells ( Figure 5B ) .
Importantly , both the spatial pattern and intensity of GFPGluR-B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> were constant among all <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue mice analyzed ( n = 11 ) .
<termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> experiments with <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue , and both <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox mice as controls , were performed as described above ( indicated with shaded symbols in Figure 6A ) .
<termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> was again highly reproducible in both <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB ( 66  12 % ; n = 4 ) and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox ( 94  2 % ; n = 3 ) mice , compared with experiments performed earlier ( Figures 2E and 4A ) .
Importantly , <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue mice was intermediate ( 75  15 % , n = 8 ) , below <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox control levels , but better than in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice .
Assessing <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> under extinction-free <termsem="GO:0035106"> condition </term> , where each trial was rewarded , confirmed again that the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit was a true <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit and not due to increased extinction ( Figure S3B ) .
Data from the experiments described in Figures 2 and 4 were combined to allow statistical comparison ( Figure 6A and 6B ) .
In summary , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue mice showed both <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performances compared with <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB ( overall ANOVA : F ( 2,41 ) = 13.6 , p < 10  4 ; memoryRescue = 75  15 % , n = 8 ; memoryFB = 66  14 % , n = 22 ; p < 0.05 ; Figure 6A ) , but were still impaired relative to <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox controls ( memory2lox = 88  8 % , n = 14 ; p < 0.005 ) , consistent with a partial rescue of the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit by circumscribed transgenic GFPGluR-B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in hippocampus and piriform cortex .
Notably , the partial <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> is in numerical agreement with the predictions from the protein correlation and the measurement of transgenic protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( see predicted <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , blue line , in Figure 6B ) .
In the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> experiments with <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB animals , <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> linearly depended on <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in cortex and hippocampus with a slope of 9.1  2.5 % ( cortex ) and 8.9  2.0 % ( hippocampus ) increase in <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> per 10 % increase in protein ( Figure 4D ) .
A 9.7 % increase in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B in these brain regions , as achieved by <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BRescue animals ( Figure 5 ) , is thus predicted to increase <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> by approximately 9 % throughout the heterogeneous population ( blue line in Figure 6B ) .
This confirms the role of these brain areas as inferred from the mosaic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and protein correlation analysis described above ( Figure 4 ) .
However , odor discrimination ( measured by the discrimination index as in Figures 1 , 2 , and 4D ) was as <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> as in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice ( 0.79  0.05 , mean  SEM compared with 0.76  0.02 , p > 0.7 , Figure 6C ) , and improved relative to <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B2lox controls ( 0.48  0.06 ; Figure 6C ; overall ANOVA : F ( 2,41 ) = 17.2 , p < 10  5 ; post hoc Newman Keuls : p < 10  3 ) , as expected if the <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> discrimination phenotype is due to Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb and unaffected by <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in piriform cortex or hippocampus .
Hence , transgenic <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , specifically in the piriform cortex and hippocampus in the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B knockout background , rescues the odor <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit but leaves <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination and learning unaltered .
Here we present mechanistic and spatial dissections of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination , learning , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
We employed gene-targeted and transgenic mice with region-specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> to demonstrate that a change in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-mediated properties of AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> in CaMKII - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> neurons of mouse forebrain , including <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb mitral and granule cells , <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhances </term> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination and learning but impairs <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
These pertinent <termsem="GO:0042048"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> behaviors </term> were assessed in a go/no-go <termsem="GO:0035106"> operant conditioning </term> task , which provides a quantitative , robust , and reproducible <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> tool [ 3 ] .
We observed among individual mice a striking variability in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performance but not in odor discrimination .
This variability could be traced to epigenetic variability in the transgenic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> , which mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> within loxP-flanked segments of gene-targeted alleles for the dominant <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> subunit <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , and hence operated the switch in <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> properties toward <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ablation and increased Ca2 + permeability .
In contrast to variable <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination and learning performances appeared already saturated by even moderate extents of Cre <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , and hence moderate changes in <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> properties .
The subsequent transgene - <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> re-introduction of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus , reversed the Cre-induced loss of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B and partially rescued the odor <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit , but left unaltered the <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination .
In a nutshell , we conclude that <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination is <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> by an increase in <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> - mediated Ca2 + permeability within the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , whereas <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> becomes impaired upon genetically induced <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ablation in higher brain centers , specifically in piriform cortex .
<termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> Discrimination Is Increased in Mice with Forebrain-Specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B Ablation or <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> .
Both forebrain-specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion led to increased <termsem="GO:0008355"> <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> learning </term> and discrimination capabilities .
This was rather pronounced for <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> mice , consistent with the overall stronger phenotypic consequences in comparison to <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion , both when forebrain-selective ( [ 58 ] , and this study ) or global [ 53,60 ] .
A detailed analysis of the sampling pattern [ 3 ] , and in particular the analysis of discrimination tasks that involved `` simple '' dissimilar monomolecular odor pairs and `` difficult '' binary mixtures , were necessary to fully capture the characteristics of the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination phenotype for forebrain-specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-depleted mice .
For closely related binary mixtures , discrimination improvements were largest , consistent with a specific alteration in odor discrimination , rather than a general <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhancement </term> of <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> capabilities .
This is further supported by the notion that no general improvement was observed in other nonolfactory <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> tasks , e.g. , hippocampus-dependent spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> tasks such as matching-to-place spatial reference <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> tasks ( Figure S2 ) .
As no Cre <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and activity was observed in the main <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory sensory </term> neurons at any <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stage ( Figure S4 and unpublished data ) , <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> epithelial function was unaltered by the genetic modification .
The vomeronasal organ showed very weak Cre <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( unpublished data ) , but a role of this structure concerning performance in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination task is unlikely ( for review , see [ 63 ] ) .
The <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> phenotype is thus likely to be associated with the <termsem="GO:0050893"> processing </term> of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> information rather than the <termsem="GO:0050911"> detection of odors </term> .
Furthermore , increased performance even after long stretches of training and , in particular , increased sampling pattern differences ( TB and ATS , unpublished data ) supported the notion that <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion resulted in <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination capability .
The <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> phenotype might thus be a result of this <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> discrimination capability or reflect additional changes in circuits underlying task acquisition .
Putative Cellular Basis of <termsem="GO:0048518"> Enhanced </term> Odor Discrimination and Learning .
<termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> properties were altered specifically in neurons of forebrain areas , most notably <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> cortex , and other cortical areas and hippocampus , leading to <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination and learning .
Interestingly , transgenic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of GFPGluR-B in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice ( genetic `` rescue '' ) , specifically in piriform cortex and hippocampus with no detectable <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , did not alter <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> capabilities .
This is consistent with a primary role of the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination and learning .
Alternatively , transgenic protein levels might have been too low to alter discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> capabilities , although <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> was clearly affected .
This notion will be further tested in mice with piriform cortex-specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ablation .
A direct contribution to the phenotype by Ca2 + influx through genetically modified AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> seems to be likely , since mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> Q/R site-unedited <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B showed even better <termsem="GO:0008355"> odor learning </term> and discrimination performance compared with mice with depleted <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B .
In both mouse models Ca2 + influx through AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> is increased , whereas the effect on the macroscopic AMPA <termsem="GO:0006810"> conductance </term> differs .
<termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> currents are reduced in mice not <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B [ 51 ] , possibly due to fewer synaptic AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> and impaired <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> and <termsem="GO:0001881"> recycling </term> .
In mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> the unedited form of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) , macroscopic <termsem="GO:0006810"> conductance </term> in whole-cell patches of CA1 pyramidals is increased [ 60 ] , but excitatory transmission in CA3-to-CA1 cell synapses is somewhat reduced , in spite of a lower threshold for generating a population spike [ 58 ] , indicating increased synaptic excitability by sustained <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , in line with the seizure-prone phenotype .
Yet , both mouse models yield <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> capability .
The milder phenotype upon <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion could be attributed to reduced <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> densities at synapses [ 40,41 ] and therefore probably to a lesser extent of Ca2 + influx .
This is further supported by kainate-induced Co2 + uptake in acute brain slices , revealing considerably higher Co2 + uptake via Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) , than those lacking <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( DRS , RS , and PHS , unpublished data ) .
Normally , <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-containing <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> are prominently <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> at the dendrodendritic synapse between mitral and granule cells in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb [ 64,65 ] .
As Ca2 + influx through <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutamate receptors </term> </term> is thought to contribute to lateral and recurrent inhibition ( [ 38 ] see also [ 39 ] ) , the absence of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , or the presence of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , is likely to result in increased inhibition between the principal neurons in this structure .
Notably , the improved <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination capabilities were apparent even upon relatively small reductions in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels .
It will be interesting to see if <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B + / <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> mice also exhibit <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination , which is indeed likely given that low levels of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) , and hence a small increase in Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0009058"> arise </term> from the attenuated <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - Bneo allele [ 60 ] , and , moreover , that <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels are decreased in these mice due to the single copy of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B + allele .
In virtually all models of the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , lateral ( and , in fewer models , also recurrent ) inhibition plays a dominant role , either in establishing spatiotemporal dynamics [ 32,66 -- 69 ] , or in directly enhancing contrast and therefore simplifying discrimination and learning of similar odorants [ 24,28,29,36 ] .
Increased inhibition will thus in general improve discriminability , consistent with the <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> improvements observed with <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B knockout , and the `` rescue '' mice .
A direct test of this link would require the quantitative measurement of inhibition in the intact preparation , a task that might be feasible with further improved in vivo electrophysiological techniques , such as targeted recordings [ 70,71 ] or simultaneous pre - and postsynaptic intracellular measurements .
<termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> Is Reduced in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B Knockout Mice and Improved by <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> in Piriform Cortex and Hippocampus .
To assess <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice , after six days the mice were probed with unrewarded odor presentations that interleaved a simple discrimination task .
Prolonged <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> tasks such as the assessment of long-term <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> memory were not performed with the seizure-prone <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BECS : FB mice .
<termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice , however , was dramatically impaired .
This can not be attributed to a general , unspecific deficit because , simultaneous to the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> trials , the normal , rewarded discrimination task was performed even better than by controls .
Reduced <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> can also not be simply attributed to increased extinction , as no significant trial-group interactions were observed and also , when restricted to the first unrewarded <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> trials , a significant impairment was observed ( Figure S3A ) .
Additionally , investigating relearning of the first discrimination task revealed a significant correlation with the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performance , showing a `` <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> '' deficit under extinction-free conditions ( Figure S3B ) .
Finally , in other <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> - related tasks , such as a hippocampus-dependent spatial reference <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> task ( Figure S2 ) , mice with <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion were not impaired after task acquisition .
We therefore conclude that forebrain-specific ablation of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B results in a specific loss of long-term <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> memory but , at the same time , in <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination and learning capabilities .
To dissect the discrimination , <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> phenotypes , and ultimately identify potential cellular correlates , we made use of the variegated Cre <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of TgCre4 mice .
Therefore , residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels were determined from each mouse that had been tested in the <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> experiments , and levels were correlated with <termsem="GO:0008355"> odor learning </term> , discrimination , and <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
The significant direct correlation between residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in hippocampus and cortical areas with <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> suggested hippocampal and/or cortical neurons as putative mediators for odor <termsem="GO:0007613"> memorization </term> and/or storage .
No measure of discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> , on the other hand , correlated with residual <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels ; even the smallest reduction in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels ( about 20 % -- 60 % ) was sufficient to establish and saturate <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> odor discrimination capabilities .
Together , this allows the conclusion that distinct mechanisms mediate discrimination / <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
This is furthermore consistent with a prominent role of cortical areas or hippocampus in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , although <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B levels in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb were also weakly correlated with <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> performance .
Transgenic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of GFPGluR-B in piriform cortex and hippocampus indeed rescued <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> to an extent strikingly consistent with the transgenic protein levels ( approximately 10 % of wild-type <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ) , confirming the reliability of the correlation analysis and the sensitivity of the <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> assay .
In general , the hippocampus is thought to be involved in only those <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> tasks that involve temporal sequence analysis or require other higher <termsem="GO:0050890"> cognitive </term> features [ 2,13,72 -- 74 ] .
In particular , extensive lesions to the hippocampal formation in rats do not interfere with long-term <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> memory in go/no-go successive <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination tasks [ 72 ] , such as the one described .
This leaves piriform cortex as the most prominent candidate for the locus of the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> deficit described , consistent with the prevalent view of piriform cortex as an associational <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> structure [ 75 ] and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> - associated changes in piriform cortex [ 7,20 -- 23 ] .
Potential Mechanisms of Specific <termsem="GO:0007608"> Olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> Impairment .
What could be the cellular basis of the <termsem="GO:0007616"> long-term memory </term> deficit brought about by lack of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-containing <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> ?
For complete <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B knockouts , increased long-term plasticity ( LTP ) was reported in hippocampal field recordings [ 51 ] .
In addition , in hippocampal and amygdala pathways lacking <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B , an <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> - dependent , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor-independent form of LTP can be readily induced [ 51,52 ] .
Mechanistically , this is likely to be due to Ca2 + influx through <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B-less AMPA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> leading to non-hebbian forms of plasticity .
However , hebbian dependence on simultaneous pre - and postsynaptic activity is often a critical feature for <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> storage ( reviewed in e.g. [ 76 ] ) ; hence , a non-hebbian form of plasticity should result in impaired <termsem="GO:0007613"> memorization </term> .
Surprisingly , in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - BFB mice no LTP changes could be observed in field measurements in the hippocampus , nor could NMDA-independent LTP be induced in hippocampal synapses between Schaffer collaterals and CA1 pyramidal cells in presence of the NMDA <termsem="GO:0048019"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antagonist </term> </term> APV ( K. Jensen , O. Hvalby , personal communication ) .
However , in other brain areas that are potentially important for the <termsem="GO:0050893"> processing </term> of <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> information , such as piriform cortex or <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb , LTP measurements have not yet been performed ; synapses of these pathways may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> differently than hippocampal CA3/CA1 synapses .
Additionally , by changing the Ca2 + permeability of <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0019722"> Ca2 + signaling </term> via AMPA and colocalized NMDA <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channels </term> </term> might be disturbed , thereby impairing <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory formation </term> .
Other forms of plasticity [ 77,78 ] induced by Ca2 + - permeable <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> might play a prevalent role in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
Alternatively , long-term stabilization might involve <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylation </term> similar to cerebellar long-term depression [ 79 ] and thus be selectively impaired by <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion .
Physiological experiments to assess these hypotheses will ideally make use of even more restricted genetic modifications with completely undisturbed input structures .
One possibility would be Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B depletion and <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ( Q ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in piriform cortex as suggested above .
Correlating Quantitative <termsem="GO:0007610"> Behavior </term> and Mosaic <termsem="GO:0010467"> Gene Expression </term> for Dissecting Phenotypes .
A critical step in discerning the discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> phenotypes from the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> phenotype was the observation of increased variability in the <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> of the <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B knockout animals and , subsequently , the individual analyses of protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> levels .
We made use of the epigenetic variability in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B excision that could be correlated to the variability in <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> but showed no correlation to variability in discrimination .
The analysis of quantitative trait loci ( for review , see [ 80 ] ) , or classically correlating different <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> phenotypes within a truly wild-type population [ 81 -- 84 ] , also attempts to find common or distinct genetic origins of different <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> traits .
These attempts undoubtedly contribute significantly to unraveling the molecular basis of <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavior </term> .
Due to subtle and multigenic differences between different strains of rodents or different individuals in a wild-type population , however , they suffer from a rather low `` signal-to-noise '' ratio .
Differences in individual genes are rather small compared with the vast number of genes involved .
As a result , purely correlating <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> traits within a wild-type population usually remains rather descriptive , whereas quantitative trait loci analysis is capable of revealing multigenic basis of <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> traits but usually lacks the power to identify the individual genes themselves .
Herein , we described a way to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by making use of the mosaic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> often associated with transgenic approaches : combining the advantages of `` classical '' genetic manipulation -- namely , that the target of the manipulation is well defined -- with the possibility to analyze variability , might also in future provide novel ways to define molecular and cellular correlates of complex <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> traits .
In this study , we combined genetically induced manipulation of the <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPAR </term> </term> composition with quantitative <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> and molecular analyses .
We could thus provide evidence for opposing roles of specific <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B manipulation and increased Ca2 + influx via <termsem="GO:0004971"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> AMPARs </term> </term> in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination/learning , and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , potentially in the <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> bulb and piriform cortex , respectively .
To achieve this , we made use of the epigenetic variability in the extent of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B ablation , which correlated with the variability in odor <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , but not in discrimination and <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> ; this finding was subsequently confirmed in <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B rescue mice with piriform cortex-specific transgenic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0008066"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GluR </term> </term> - B. Extending these principles of combining quantitative <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> analyses with minimal and dosed genetic interference , together with further physiological analyses , will ultimately pinpoint the neural circuitries underlying related , but distinct , <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> traits in <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> and other systems .

Immunoreactivity was detected with ECLplus ( Amersham , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) , and immunoblots were scanned and quantitatively analyzed with ImageJ .
<termsem="GO:0007610"> Behavioral </term> analysis : Subjects .
All mice were four to six weeks old at the beginning of the experiments .
Subjects were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle in isolated cages in a temperature and humidity-controlled animal facility .
All <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> training was conducted during daytime .
During the training period , animals were kept on free food but on a water-restriction schedule designed to keep them at > 85 % of their free food body weight .
Continuous water restriction was never longer than 12 h. All animal care and procedures were in accordance with the animal ethics guidelines of the Max-Planck Society .
All <termsem="GO:0007608"> olfactory </term> discrimination experiments were performed using three modified eight - channel olfactometers ( [ 61 ] , Knosys , Bethesda , Maryland , United States of America ) operated by custom-written software in Igor ( Wave Metrics , Lake Oswego , Oregon , United States of America ) on Pentium I , II , and III PCs running Microsoft Windows 98 .
Great care was taken to counterbalance groups between setups .
In brief , animals were presented with odor from one out of eight possible odor channels and rewarded with a 2 - to 4-l drop of water in a combined odor/reward port ( Figure 1B ) , ensuring tight association of the water-reward with a presented odorant .
Head insertion into the port was monitored by an IR beam and photodiode ( Figure 1B ) .
Odors used were n-amyl acetate , ethyl butyrate , pelargonic acid , valeric acid , and binary mixtures of cineol and eugenol .
If not otherwise noted , odors were diluted to 1 % in mineral oil ( Fluka Chemie , Steinheim , Germany ) and further diluted by airflow to a final concentration of approximately 0.15 % .
All dilutions in the text refer to the dilution in mineral oil .
All chemicals were obtained from Fluka Chemie .
Task <termsem="GO:0046959"> habituation </term> training .
Beginning 1 -- 3 d after the start of the water restriction schedule , animals were trained using standard <termsem="GO:0035106"> operant-conditioning </term> procedures [ 3 ] .
In a first pretraining step , each lick at the water delivery tube was rewarded .
After 20 licks , a second stage was entered in which head insertion initiated a 2-s `` odor '' presentation during which a lick was rewarded .
The `` odorant '' used in the pretraining was the carrier medium mineral oil .
All animals <termsem="GO:0007612"> learned </term> this task within one day ( 2 -- 3 sessions 30 min each ) .
Structure of an individual trial .
The mouse initiates each trial by breaking a light barrier at the opening of the sampling port ( see also [ 3 ] ) .
This opens one of eight odor valves , and a diversion valve that diverts all air flow away from the animal for typically 500 ms. After the release of the diversion valve , the odor is accessible to the animal for 2,000 ms. If it continuously licks at the lick port during this time ( once in at least three out of four 500-ms bins ) , it can receive a 2 - to 4-l water reward after the end of the 2,000-ms period .
If the animal does not continuously lick , or if the presented odor was a designated nonrewarded odor , neither a reward is given nor any sort of punishment , to minimize stress for the animal .
Trials are counted as correct if the animal licks continuously upon presentation of a rewarded odor or does not lick continuously with a nonrewarded odor .
A second trial can not be initiated unless an intertrial interval of at least 5 s has passed .
This interval is sufficiently long so that animals typically retract quickly after the end of the trial .
Odors are presented in a pseudo-randomized scheme ( no more than two successive presentations of the same odor , equal numbers within each 20-trial block ) .
No intrinsic preference toward any of the odors was observed but controlled for by counterbalancing .
A total of 100 -- 300 trials were performed each day , separated into 30 - to 40-min stretches to ensure maximal motivation despite the mild water restriction scheme .
Additionally , motivation was controlled by monitoring intertrial intervals and the <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> frequency [ 3 ] .
The simplest measure of performance is the fraction of trials in which the animal <termsem="GO:0050896"> responds </term> correctly -- that is , <termsem="GO:0050896"> responds </term> with licking to the presentation of the S + odor and does not lick with presentation of the S  odor .
It was shown previously , however , that the detailed sampling pattern is a more sensitive measure of discrimination performance [ 3 ] .
To avoid long ( > 3-week ) training periods , we chose not to measure discrimination times [ 3 ] but to analyze the average sampling <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavior </term> in total .
Upon presentation of a rewarded odor , the animal usually continuously breaks the beam , whereas upon presentation of an unrewarded odor the head is quickly retracted .
The difference in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to the rewarded and unrewarded odor is approximately sigmoidal ( Figures 1D , 1E , and 2D ) and yields a sensitive measure of the discrimination performance .
From this difference or from a sigmoidal fit to the difference ( Figure 1E ) , several measures of discrimination can be determined : the average difference , peak , or maximum , time of half maximum , and slope of the fitted sigmoid .
Whereas for small trial numbers ( < 200 ) the slope often is not well constrained , any of the other parameters yielded essentially the same results .
The discrimination index plotted in Figures 1F , 2C , 4D , and 6C refers to the fitted maximum , generally ranging from zero to one , one indicating the best discrimination .
Identical results were obtained with other measures of discrimination , such as the average sampling difference .
After <termsem="GO:0046959"> habituation </term> , mice were trained to discriminate 1 % amylacetate from 1 % ethylbutyrate for 500 trials .
During the last 100 trials , the S + odor was rewarded in only 50 % of the cases to increase the resistance to extinction of the acquired <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> .
These trials were excluded for the statistical analysis of the <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> curves .
Inclusion did not alter the result of the ANOVA ; however , linear fitting of the <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> curve was not appropriate anymore as partial saturation of <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> performance had already occurred .
Subsequently , animals were trained for 500 trials on the `` difficult '' discrimination task [ 3 ] between the binary mixtures 0.6 % eugenol/0 .4 % cineol and 0.4 % eugenol/0 .6 % cineol .
To allow comparison , the last 100 trials were altered as for the `` simple '' discrimination task above .
After two days of rest , animals were finally trained on the `` simple '' discrimination task between 1 % pelargonic acid and 1 % valeric acid for another 600 trials .
In all experiments , counterbalancing between both odors and setups was ensured within and between genetic groups , or results were compared with counterbalanced subgroups , which in every case yielded identical results .
During the entire course of the experiment , the person handling the animals and operating the olfactometers was blind to the genotype of the mice .
To assess <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> , after 280 trials of training to discriminate between pelargonic acid and valeric acid , <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> trials were interleaved for 120 trials ; that is , within each block of 20 trials two unrewarded amylacetate and two unrewarded ethylbutyrate trials were included .
<termsem="GO:0007613"> Memory </term> scores are given as the fraction of those unrewarded trials that were <termsem="GO:0050896"> responded </term> to `` correctly '' ( licking response to the odor that was rewarded in the initial training session [ S + ] , no response to the odor that was not rewarded initially [ S  ] ) .
Due to the epileptic phenotype and the slightly increased mortality [ 58 ] , GluRBECS : FB mice were trained only for the initial period of 400 trials .
<termsem="GO:0007612"> Learning </term> curves for both correct performance ( `` percentage correct '' ) and the discrimination performance were analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA .
Additionally , <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> curves were assessed by linearly fitting of trend lines to the data with fixed offsets , leaving the slope as the only variable .

( B ) Scheme of an individual trial .
Breaking a light barrier , the mouse initiates a trial .
An odor is presented , and ( depending on the odor denotation and the mouse 's <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> ) the mouse is rewarded or retracts its head .
A small ( 2 - to 4-l ) water reward is given at the end of an S + odor if the mouse continuously licks at the delivery tube during the 2-s trial .
A trial is counted as correct if the mouse licks continuously upon presentation of a rewarded ( S + ) odor or does not lick continuously with a nonrewarded ( S  ) odor [ 3 ] .
