Cloning and characterization of the <termsem="EG:94178"> mouse Mcoln1 </term> gene reveals an alternatively spliced transcript not seen in humans .
Mucolipidosis type IV ( MLIV ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by severe neurologic and ophthalmologic abnormalities .
Recently the <termsem="EG:57192"> MLIV </term> gene , <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> , has been identified as a new member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP ) cation channel superfamily .
Here we report the cloning and characterization of the mouse homologue , <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> , and report a novel splice variant that is not seen in humans .
The human and mouse genes display a high degree of synteny .
<termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> shows 91 % amino acid and 86 % nucleotide identity to <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> .
Also , <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> maps to chromosome 8 and contains an open reading frame of 580 amino acids , with a transcript length of approximately 2 kb encoded by 14 exons , similar to its human counterpart .
The transcript that results from murine specific alternative splicing encodes a 611 amino acid protein that differs at the c-terminus .
<termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> is highly similar to <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> , especially in the transmembrane domains and ion pore region .
Also , the late endosomal/lysosomal targeting signal is conserved , supporting the hypothesis that the protein is localized to these vesicle membranes .
To date , there are very few reports describing species-specific splice variants .
While identification of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> is crucial to the development of mouse models for MLIV , the fact that there are two transcripts in mice suggests an additional or alternate function of the gene that may complicate phenotypic assessment .
Mucolipidosis type IV ( MLIV ; MIM 252650 ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder that is characterized by corneal clouding , delayed psychomotor development , and mental retardation that usually presents during the first year of life [ 1 ] .
Another interesting clinical characteristic is that patients are constitutively achlorhydric with associated hypergastremia [ 2 ] .
Patients with MLIV do not show mucopolysaccharide excretion , skeletal changes , or organomegaly like the other mucolipidoses .
Abnormal lysosomal storage bodies and large vacuoles have been found in skin and conjuctival biopsies using electron-microscopy and , prior to gene identification , served as the only means of diagnosis [ 3-5 ] .
A recent report estimates that the carrier frequency of MLIV in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is 1 in 100 , and mutations have been reported in Jewish and non-Jewish families [ 6-9 ] .
The human gene <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> ( GenBank #AF287270 ) maps to chromosome 19p13.2-13.3 and encodes a novel protein that is a member of the transient receptor potential ( TRP ) cation channel gene superfamily [ 7-10 ] .
Protein trafficking studies suggest that MLIV is the result of a defect in the late endocytic pathway , contrary to the other mucolipidoses which are typically caused by defective lysosomal hydrolases [ 11,12 ] .
Recent work in Caenorhabditis elegans supports this hypothesis .
Loss of function mutants of the <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> C. elegans homologue , <termsem="EG:176074"> cup-5 </term> , result in an increased rate of endocytosis , accumulation of large vacuoles , and a decreased rate of endocytosed protein breakdown ; while over-expression of this gene reverses the phenotype [ 13 ] .
Cloning and characterization of the mouse homologue of <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> is crucial for the development of mouse models of MLIV to further study this disorder .
Cloning and mapping of the mouse homologue <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> .
In order to clone the mouse homologue of <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> , the human amino acid sequence was compared to the high throughput genomic sequence ( HTGS ) database using TBLASTN , which identified the mouse BAC clone RPCI-23_387H4 ( GB No .
AC079544 .1 ) .
Correspondence with the Joint Genome Institute and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) Human Genome Center confirmed the location of this BAC to mouse chromosome 8 and allowed us to construct a physical map of this region [ 14 ] ( Fig. 1A ) .
The BAC sequence was then compared to the mouse EST database using BLASTN , and multiple ESTs and their corresponding I.M.A.G.E. clones were identified .
Physical and transcript map of the <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> gene region .
( A ) Physical map showing a 590 kb segment of mouse chromosome 8 syntenous to human chromosome 19 , anchored by the genes <termsem="EG:16337"> Insr </term> and <termsem="EG:50767"> Nte </term> .
The region is covered by three BACs : RPCI-23_334D24 ( AC087153 ) , RPCI-23_312B8 ( AC087150 ) , and RPCI-23_387H4 ( AC079544 ) .
( B ) The transcript map of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> shows 14 exons , and the locations of the probes used in this study are illustrated .
The map also shows the expanded exon 13 in the alternatively spliced transcript ( hashed box ) .
UniGene cluster Mm .39099 is the homologue of the human zinc finger gene ( AC001252 ) .
It should be noted that the scale of the transcript map is in reference to the 201 kb scale of BAC RPCI-23_387H4 .
Three clones ( ID Nos. 604971 , 1228665 , 1247566 ) from the UniGene cluster Mm .
8356 were obtained , sequenced , and assembled into a 2 kb transcript with an open reading frame of 580 amino acids designated <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> ( GB No .
AF302010 ) .
Comparison of the cDNA sequence to the BAC clone showed that the gene consists of 14 exons .
We then created a transcript map of the <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> region of mouse chromosome 8 ( Fig. 1B ) , noting the presence of the UniGene Cluster Mm .
39099 , a homologue of the human zinc finger gene ( GB No .
AC001252 ) that terminates approximately 1.8 kb before the start of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> ; and <termsem="EG:50767"> Nte </term> , the mouse homologue of the <termsem="EG:10908"> human neuropathy target esterase </term> gene ( NTE ) beginning 130 base pairs after the polyadenylation signal for <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> .
The transcript map of the region surrounding <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> is similar to the corresponding region of the homologous <termsem="EG:57192"> human MCOLN1 </term> region [ 15 ] , and the presence of the zinc finger gene and <termsem="EG:50767"> Nte </term> confirms and extends the region of synteny between human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 8 .
Characterization of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> .
Comparison of the mouse and human peptide sequences showed 91 % identity ( Fig. 2 ) .
The C. elegans homologue <termsem="EG:176074"> cup-5 </term> shows 34 % identity with <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> and BLASTP analysis of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> identified a putative Drosophila melanogaster homologue that shows 38 % identity ( Fig. 2 ) .
Interestingly , two <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> amino acid substitutions that result in MLIV occur at conserved amino acids .
TMPred analysis predicts a protein structure that is nearly identical to <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> , containing 6 transmembrane domains with the N - and C-termini residing in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2 ) [ 9 ] .

Expression analysis of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> .
Mouse adult multiple tissue and embryonic Northern blots were hybridized using a probe generated from mouse exon 2 ( probe 1 , Fig. 1B ) , yielding a band of approximately 2.4 kb ( isoform 1 ) , as expected , and a less abundant and unexpected 4.4 kb band ( isoform 2 ) ( Figs. 3A & 3B ) .
The 2.4 kb band shows ubiquitous but variable expression , with the highest expression in brain , liver and kidney .
The fetal tissue blot shows decreasing levels of the 2.4 kb message with increasing gestational age .
Since the <termsem="EG:57192"> human MCOLN1 </term> gene encodes a single transcript [ 7-9 ] , we carried out additional hybridizations with probes generated from various regions of the coding sequence and 3 ' UTR , and all probes identified the same two transcripts in the mouse ( data not shown ) .
In order to verify the presence of a single mouse locus , we hybridized a mouse Southern blot with the exon 2 probe .
Four different restriction enzymes were used , and only the expected size bands for the chromosome 8 locus were detected ( data not shown ) .
Northern analysis of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> .
( A ) Mouse fetal tissue Northern and ( B ) mouse multiple tissue Northern blots ( Clontech ) hybridized with a probe generated from exon 2 ( probe 1 , Fig. 1B ) .
( C ) Hybridization of the multiple tissue blot with a probe from the alternatively spliced segment of exon 13 ( probe 2 , Fig. 1B ) .
<termsem="EG:11461"> -Actin </term> control hybridization is shown below each blot .
Characterization of the <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> alternative splice variant .
In order to determine the coding sequence for the larger transcript , we searched the mouse EST database using each intron as well as the genomic sequence flanking the <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> gene .
Two ESTs were identified that contained sequence from intron 12 ( GB No .
AI430291 and AA874645 ) , and the corresponding clones were sequenced .
Clone 408619 ( ESTs : GB No .
AI430291 , AI429558 ) begins approximately 1.1 kb before exon 13 and continues through the exon and splices correctly to exon 14 .
Clone 1281641 ( EST : GB No .
AA874645 ) begins 175 bp before exon 13 and also splices correctly to exon 14 .
A mouse multiple tissue Northern was hybridized using a probe generated from the putative intron sequence in clone 408619 ( Probe 2 , Fig. 1B ) , which detected only the 4.4 kb band ( Fig. 3C ) .
In order to determine the sequence of the entire transcript , RT-PCR using primers in exons 10 and 11 paired with a primer in intron 12 was performed using BALB/c mouse brain total RNA and the resulting products sequenced .
These products show that the larger transcript is due to an alternative splice event that results in an expanded exon 13 .
Specifically , exon 12 splices at bp 436 of intron 12 , creating a large 1614 bp exon 13 that splices correctly to exon 14 .
The open reading frame of this alternatively spliced transcript is 611 amino acids , 28 amino acids longer than the message encoded by the 2.4 kb transcript .
TMPred analysis predicts that isoform 2 encodes a protein identical in structure to <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> , possessing 6 transmembrane domains and a channel pore , however the protein sequences diverge at amino acid 526 .
The 55 amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic tail encoded by the 2.4 kb transcript is completely different from the 86 amino acid tail encoded by the murine specific 4.4 kb transcript ( Fig. 4 ) .
Clontech Mouse RNA Master Blots were hybridized with the exon 2 and intron 12 probes mentioned above in an attempt to determine if these two transcripts showed differences in expression patterns , however , there was no significant difference in the 22 tissues represented ( data not shown ) .
Peptide sequence comparison of the two alternatively spliced <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> isoforms .
The green box surrounds the divergent c-terminal cytoplasmic tails .
The blue lines indicate the transmembrane domains .
Next , we directly compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the alternatively spliced mouse transcript to the entire <termsem="EG:57192"> human MCOLN1 </term> genomic sequence and found no significant similarity .
As mentioned previously , Northern blots performed with <termsem="EG:57192"> human MCOLN1 </term> probes show only one 2.4 kb transcript .
In addition , we hybridized a human multiple tissue Northern and human Southern with a probe in human intron 12 that is adjacent to exon 13 .
The probe was located in the region syntenic to that which encodes the alternate mouse transcript .
Only the expected bands were detected on the Southern and no bands were detected on the Northern , confirming that this alternative transcript is specific to <termsem="EG:94178"> murine Mcoln1 </term> .
Recent BLASTP analysis of the alternate <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> transcript yields a match to a putative 145 amino acid anonymous protein ( GB No .
BAB25862 ) predicted from a RIKEN clone .
It is obvious from our results , however , that the identification of this sequence as a full-length protein is incorrect since probes unique to the clone , as well as probes containing the <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> coding sequence , identify the same transcripts .
Comparison of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> isoform 1 to its human homologue shows striking similarity at both the amino acid and nucleotide level .
All six of the transmembrane domains , as well as the putative cation channel are highly conserved .
The putative di-leucine ( L-L-X-X ) motif at the C-terminus , which may act as a late endosomal/lysosomal targeting signal , is also conserved [ 9 ] .
This speculation is supported by work with <termsem="EG:176074"> cup-5 </term> [ 13 ] , the c. elegans homologue of <termsem="EG:57192"> MCOLN1 </term> , since cellular localization studies suggest that the protein is found in the late endosomes and/or lysosomes .
The <termsem="EG:94178"> mouse Mcoln1 </term> gene has two alternatively spliced isoforms , with isoform 2 having a different c-terminal cytoplasmic tail .
The unique 86 amino acid c-terminal tail lacks the lysosomal targeting signal and does not contain any conserved domains when compared against the current profile databases .
We speculate that this protein may have similar channel function but an alternate subcellular localization , but this must be proven once isoform-specific antibodies are raised .
However , our results suggest that phenotypic assessment of <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> knock-out mice may be complicated and that care must be taken when interpreting data on mouse gene expression and phenotype .
Interestingly , the second <termsem="EG:94178"> Mcoln1 </term> isoform is not seen in humans and the sequence of the alternatively spliced region is not conserved between man and mouse .
To date , very few genes have been reported that show species specific alternative splice variants .
<termsem="EG:4340"> MOG </term> , <termsem="EG:4340"> myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein </term> , has many different splice variants in humans that are not found in mice [ 17 ] .
<termsem="EG:100008757"> ATP11B </term> , a P-type ATPase , has a rabbit-specific splice variant that deletes a transmembrane domain and therefore likely alters the putative function of the protein [ 18 ] .
Sequencing of the human genome has led to estimates of approximately 32,000 genes , a total surprise given the previous significantly higher estimates that were based on the number of expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) in the public databases .
This apparent disparity suggests a major role for alternative splicing in creating genetic complexity , and has brought the study of splicing regulation to the forefront of molecular genetics .
It is likely that an abundance of species-specific splice variants will be identified as the characterization of alternatively spliced transcripts progresses .

For the alternative transcript , a probe was generated in the region between exons 12 and 13 with primers 5 ' - GTGTCCACCACCTGAGAG-3 ' ( forward ) and 5 ' - GAAGTAGCATTCCTGCAGGC-3 ' ( reverse ) with an annealing temperature of 62 C .
The filters were then hybridized with <termsem="EG:11461"> -actin </term> probes .
