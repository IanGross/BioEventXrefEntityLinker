A screen for proteins that interact with PAX6 : <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> disrupt interaction with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The PAX6 protein is a transcriptional regulator with a key role in ocular and neurological development .
Individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in the PAX6 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> have malformations of the eye and brain .
Little is known about the interactions of PAX6 with other proteins , so we carried out a systematic screen for proteins that interact with PAX6 .
We used bioinformatics techniques to characterise a highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> at the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> of the PAX6 protein .
Yeast two-hybrid library screens were then carried out to identify brain-expressed proteins that interact with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> and with the entire PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> - <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> - <termsem="SO:0001445"> threonine </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
Three novel PAX6-interacting proteins were identified : the post-synaptic density ( PSD ) protein HOMER3 , the dynein subunit DNCL1 , and the tripartite motif protein TRIM11 .
Three <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> , previously identified in patients with eye malformations , all reduced or abolished the interactions .
Our preliminary data suggest that PAX6 interacts with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
We propose that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 is a mechanism by which synaptic activation could lead to changes in neuronal transcriptional activity , and that some of the neural anomalies in patients with PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> could be explained by impaired protein-protein interactions .
The PAX6 protein is a member of the PAX ( paired-box ) family of transcriptional regulators and is essential for normal ocular and neural development [ 1 ] .
Heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> of the human PAX6 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> cause aniridia ( absence of the iris ) and a range of other congenital eye malformations [ 2 ] .
Neural defects such as foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve hypoplasia are common in PAX6-associated eye disease [ 3-5 ] .
Homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in man and mouse are lethal and result in severe developmental abnormalities including anophthalmia , severe reduction of the olfactory structures and gross brain malformations [ 2,6 ] .
The roles of PAX6 in brain development have mainly been studied in homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice or rats and include arealisation of the cerebral cortex [ 7 ] , formation of the prosencephalon-mesencephalon boundary [ 8 ] , axon guidance [ 8 ] , differentiation of neurons from glia [ 9 ] and neuronal migration in the cerebellum [ 10 ] .
The discovery of multiple and diverse roles for PAX6 in brain development prompted MRI analyses of aniridia patients , and a range of distinctive brain anomalies were uncovered .
The most common and striking of these was absence or hypoplasia of the anterior commissure [ 11 ] .
Other defects included absence or hypoplasia of the pineal gland , cortical polymicrogyria , white matter changes in the corpus callosum and grey matter changes in the cerebellum [ 11-13 ] .
Functional changes included hyposmia and abnormal inter-hemispheric auditory transfer [ 11,14 ] .
The defining <termsem="SO:0000110"> feature </term> of all PAX proteins is the presence of a 128 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - binding paired <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> that has been highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> over evolution [ 1 ] .
In addition to the paired <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , PAX6 also contains a <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - binding homeodomain and a <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> , <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> and <termsem="SO:0001445"> threonine </term> - rich ( PST ) <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> at the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> [ 1,6 ] .
The PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , which encompasses the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> 145 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> of PAX6 , has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator [ 6 ] .
The PAX6 protein directly regulates a wide range of target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 1,2 ] including Pax2 [ 15 ] , Ngn2 [ 16 ] and glucagon [ 17 ] .
The Pax6 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> has a spatially and temporally complex expression pattern in the eye , brain , nasal structures , spinal cord and pancreas [ 1 ] .
Although PAX6 is clearly involved in multiple developmental processes , common themes are now emerging concerning the role of PAX6 in neural tissues .
Gradients of Pax6 expression are important for determining positional characteristics in the retina [ 18 ] and the neocortex [ 7 ] .
PAX6 plays a role in development of specific axonal connections between the retina and the brain [ 18 ] and within the forebrain [ 8,19 ] .
It is also involved in the differentiation of neural cell types from multipotent precursors in the retina [ 16 ] and the cerebral cortex [ 9 ] through activation of bHLH <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> such as Ngn2 and Mash1 .
These studies provide a clear link between PAX6 function in the retina and the brain , and are of particular relevance to the neurological phenotypes of individuals with PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
It is becoming apparent that transcription factors do not act in isolation but are dependent on interactions with other proteins to carry out their function [ 20,21 ] .
These interactions introduce more specificity into the regulatory function of a given transcription factor .
To date only three PAX6 protein-protein interactions have been described : with SOX2 on the lens-specific <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer element </term> of the -crystallin <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 22 ] ; with MDIA , which modulates PAX6 activity in early neuronal development [ 23 ] , and with MAF proteins on the glucagon <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> , which causes increased expression of this pancreatic hormone <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 17 ] .
Here we report the preliminary results of the first systematic screen for proteins that interact with PAX6 .
We used <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignment algorithms and <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> prediction programs to define a new <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of 32 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> at the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal end </term> of the PAX6 protein .
We then screened a brain library with this <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> using the yeast two-hybrid technique and identified three novel interacting proteins , HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The interaction between PAX6 and these proteins was disrupted by <termsem="SO:0000782"> naturally occurring </term> <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .

We and others [ 31-33 ] noted that there is significant <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> at the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal end </term> of the PAX6 protein .

Strong <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> was seen in distantly related species such as axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum ) and sea urchin ( Paracentrotus lividus ) ( Figure 1a ) .

( c ) When 4 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> are added in the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> direction , 2 beta sheets are now predicted .
We subjected the whole PAX6 PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> to <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> analysis using JPRED , a program that uses a number of different protein structure prediction algorithms to generate a <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> ( Figure 1 ) [ 25,26 ] .
The PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> was largely devoid of <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> except for the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal region </term> , which contained two <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> beta sheets within the highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , one in the ` GLISP ' motif and one in the ` SPVPQ ' motif ( identical to the pattern shown in Figure 1c ) .
Initially we defined the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> </term> as running from the ` GLISP ' motif up to the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> , since this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> was most highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> and contained strongly <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure elements </term> .
However when we performed <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> prediction analysis on this 28 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> , the first beta sheet was lost ( Figure 1b ) .
Addition of another 4 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> ( TTST ) immediately before ` GLISP ' caused recovery of the first beta sheet ( Figure 1c ) .
Although these 4 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> are not highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> ( Figure 1a ) , they appear to be important for seeding the first beta sheet and therefore for <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> .
Thus we define the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> as being the final 32 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> of PAX6 , running from <termsem="SO:0001445"> threonine </term> 391 to the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> ( top line of Figure 1c ) .
We hypothesised that the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> might be involved in protein-protein interactions , and we tested this by screening a <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library using the yeast two-hybrid system with a <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> ( PAX6CTP ) in which the 32 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> was fused to the yeast GAL4 <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
We chose to screen a mouse brain <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library as no human libraries were available .
Given the fact that the <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequence </term> of the PAX6 protein is identical in man and mouse , we reasoned that a mouse brain library would yield relevant interactors .
For comparison we also carried out the screen using a <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> containing the whole PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( PAX6PST ) .
The <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> screen gave 15 colonies that were positive with all three reporters and the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> screen gave 62 colonies .
The interacting <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> were isolated and the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000667"> inserts </term> sequenced .
Three <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> were identified 3 or more times , Homer3 ( NM_011984 ) , Dncl1 ( Dynein cytoplasmic light <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain </term> 1 , NM_019682 , also known as Pin or Dlc8 ) and Trim11 ( Tripartite motif protein family member 11 , NM_053168 ) .
Homer3 ( 6 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ) and Dncl1 ( 2 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ) were identified in the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> screen .
Homer3 ( 7 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ) , Dncl1 ( 2 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ) and Trim11 ( 6 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ) were identified in the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> screen .
All <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000667"> inserts </term> were in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> with the <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding region </term> of the pPC86 GAL4 activation <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
None of the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> was present in a list of <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> false positives [ 34 ] .
HOMER3 is a member of the HOMER family of neuronal post-synaptic density ( PSD ) proteins [ 35 ] .
DNCL1 is a subunit of two motor protein complexes , dynein and myosin-Va , both of which are involved in intracellular trafficking of proteins and organelles in neurons [ 36,37 ] .
TRIM11 is a member of the tripartite motif protein family and contains a RING finger , a <termsem="SO:0000620"> B-box </term> zinc finger , a <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and a B30 .2 <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> [ 38 ] .
The possible significance of the interactions between these proteins and PAX6 is discussed below .
To check that the Homer3 , Dncl1 and Trim11 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were not identified multiple times solely because they are highly abundant in the library , we performed a semi-quantitative PCR assay .
We compared the relative abundance of Homer3 , Dncl1 , Trim11 and Pax6 with Gapdh and Atp5a1 .
Gapdh and Atp5a1 both show strong constitutive expression in a variety of tissues including the brain [ 29,30 ] .
Homer3 , Dncl1 , Trim11 and Pax6 were only amplified strongly after 35 cycles of PCR ( Figure 2 ) and were therefore present at relatively low levels compared to Gapdh ( amplified strongly after 25 cycles ) and Atp5a1 ( amplified strongly after 30 cycles ; Figure 2 ) .

Atp5a1 ( 415 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) and Gapdh ( 450 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) , which are highly expressed in the brain , are included for comparison .
M indicates the   174 HaeIII <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> size marker ; the positions of the 603 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> and 310 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> marker bands are indicated .
We concluded that Homer3 , Dncl1 and Trim11 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were not highly abundant in the library .
This is consistent with the idea that they were pulled out because the encoded proteins interact specifically with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> or PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of PAX6 .
Yeast two-hybrid pairwise interactions .
By library screening we identified two proteins ( HOMER3 and DNCL1 ) that interact with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> and three proteins ( HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 ) that interact with the whole PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
This suggests that HOMER3 and DNCL1 interact specifically with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> while TRIM11 interacts with a more <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> part </term> of the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
We conducted pairwise tests between specific <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> to confirm the interactions identified in the library screen and to further investigate the interaction between PAX6 and HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The Dncl1 and Trim11 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> that were pulled out of the library were full-length , but the Homer3 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> lacked the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> 70 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> .
The missing <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding region </term> was <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> into the truncated Homer3 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> to give a full-length expression <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> ( see Methods ) .
Pairwise interactions were carried out with both the full-length and truncated Homer3 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> .
We confirmed that the whole PAX6 PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> interacts with HOMER3 ( full-length and truncated <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> ) , TRIM11 and DNCL1 , as all three reporter <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were strongly activated in pairwise tests ( Figure 3 ; Table 1 ) .
In contrast the interaction between the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> and HOMER3 or DNCL1 could not be confirmed with pairwise tests ( Table 1 ) .
Occasionally , partial suppression of growth on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid was observed , indicating low-level activation of the URA3 reporter ; however HIS3 and LacZ activation were not observed .
The reasons for this are not clear , although it may be that the pairwise tests were of sub-optimal sensitivity compared to the library screen .
However we were able to confirm that the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> is important for the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 because interaction with the PAX6PST-CT <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , which lacks the final 32 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , was completely abolished ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
TRIM11 interacted equally well with PAX6PST and PAX6PST-CT ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
This is consistent with the library screens in which TRIM11 was isolated with the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> but not with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> and supports the idea that the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> is not important for the interaction between PAX6 and TRIM11 .

Having confirmed that HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 interact with the PAX6 PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , we next investigated how the interactions were affected by three <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> that have been previously described in patients with ocular anomalies .
The first <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> is a single <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitution </term> 1627A > G that causes a <termsem="SO:0001448"> glutamine </term> to <termsem="SO:0001451"> arginine </term> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitution </term> in the last <termsem="SO:0000360"> codon </term> of PAX6 .

The second <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( 1615del10 ) was found in an aniridia family [ 28 ] .
This <termsem="SO:0000865"> frame-shifting </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> occurs just before the PAX6 <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> and is predicted to cause translational read-through into the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> , generating a protein in which the last 5 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> of the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> are <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaced </term> by a 103 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> - extension .
Affected individuals in this family showed unusual neurobehavioural traits including impaired social cognition and poor verbal inhibition [ 28 ] .
MRI analysis revealed grey matter abnormalities in the frontal lobe , temporal lobe and cerebellum , and white matter deficits in the corpus callosum [ 13 ] .
The third <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> 1629insT ( X423L ) has been reported in several aniridia patients [ 11,12,27,33 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000046"> Insertion </term> of a single T <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> at <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> 1629 <termsem="SO:0000041"> changes </term> the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> ( TAA ) to a <termsem="SO:0001437"> leucine </term> <termsem="SO:0000360"> codon </term> ( TTA ) and generates a full length PAX6 protein with a <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> extension that extends for a further 35 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> into the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> .
MRI analysis of six patients with this <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> revealed variable brain defects including absence or hypoplasia of the anterior commissure , pineal gland and olfactory bulbs [ 12 ] .
Two patients had temporal polymicrogyria , one in association with epilepsy [ 12 ] .
The three <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> were introduced into the PAX6PST <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , and pairwise tests were carried out to investigate the interaction of each <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> protein with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
All three <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> had a clear effect on the interactions .
The most subtle <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( Q422R ) caused a reduction in the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
The <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> extension <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> X423L and1615del10 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> both dramatically reduced or abolished the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
None of the three <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> affected the interaction with TRIM11 which again is consistent with the hypothesis that TRIM11 interacts with a more <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> part </term> of the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
On the basis of <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> predictions and <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> , we defined a novel PAX6 protein <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , which we have called the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> .
We performed yeast two-hybrid library screens with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> and the whole PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and we identified three novel interacting proteins , HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
In library screens , HOMER3 and DNCL1 interacted with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> and the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> while TRIM11 interacted only with the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , suggesting that HOMER3 and DNCL1 specifically interact with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> while TRIM11 interacts with a more <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> part </term> of the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
The interactions between the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 were confirmed in pairwise tests .
We were not able to confirm the interaction between HOMER3 or DNCL1 with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> in pairwise tests , but we showed that the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> was important for PAX6/HOMER3 or PAX6/DNCL1 interaction because HOMER3 and DNCL1 did not interact with a PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> lacking the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> .
HOMER3 is found in the PSD of neurons and directly binds to type I metabotropic glutamate receptors , which act via phospholipase C to stimulate IP3-mediated release of Ca2 + from intracellular vesicles [ 35,39 ] .
HOMER3 is a member of the HOMER family of proteins that are constitutively expressed in the brain and play a role in post-synaptic signalling and receptor trafficking by forming multivalent links with various receptors and PSD scaffolding proteins [ 35,39-41 ] .
HOMER proteins have also been implicated in axon guidance during brain development [ 42 ] .
DNCL1 is a subunit of two intracellular transport protein complexes , dynein and myosin Va [ 36 ] .
Dynein and myosin Va are involved in the microtubule-based and actin-based movement respectively of proteins , organelles and vesicles in neurons [ 36,37 ] .
Myosin Va is enriched in the PSD [ 43 ] , and DNCL1 binds to a variety of PSD proteins including guanylate kinase <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> - associated protein [ 44 ] and neuronal nitric oxide synthase [ 45 ] .
TRIM11 is a member of the mouse tripartite motif protein family ( also known as the RBCC family ) , and contains the three characteristic structural motifs of this protein family , a RING finger , a <termsem="SO:0000620"> B-box </term> zinc finger , and a <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , as well as a B30 .2 <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> that is found in many but not all TRIM proteins [ 38 ] .
TRIM11 interacts with Humanin , a protein that suppresses the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer 's disease [ 46 ] .
TRIM11 lowers Humanin levels by a mechanism that appears to involve ubiqutin-mediated proteasomal degradation [ 46 ] .
At present our data must be considered preliminary because the interactions have not been confirmed by any other approach .
However it is interesting to speculate that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 may be the basis of a mechanism by which synaptic signalling causes changes in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression .
We propose that PAX6 is sequestered in the PSD by binding to HOMER3 .
Since receptor activation causes dissociation of HOMER proteins [ 35 ] , PAX6 may be released as a result of synaptic activity , allowing it to interact with DNCL1 .
The PAX6/DNCL1 complex could then participate in myosin Va-mediated transport along the PSD-associated actin cytoskeleton followed by dynein-mediated transport along the microtubule network , eventually reaching the nucleus [ 36 ] .
Since TRIM11 is implicated in protein degradation [ 46 ] , it may play a role in PAX6 protein turnover .
Precedents for association of transcription factors with the post-synaptic density include STAT3 and CREB , which act as messengers between the synapse and the nucleus [ 47,48 ] .
Although the full-length PAX6 protein is predominantly nuclear , there is good evidence in mouse , quail and nematode for an <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> that lacks the paired <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , is both nuclear and cytoplasmic , and binds <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> through the homeodomain alone [ 49-51 ] .
In mice the paired-less <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> is relatively abundant in brain [ 49 ] ; however its subcellular localisation in neurones , and the possibility of an association with the PSD , remains to be investigated .
Regarding the subcellular localisation of the putative interacting proteins , HOMER3 is predominantly found at the interface between the PSD and the cytoplasm [ 39 ] , DNCL1 is chiefly cytoplasmic , although nuclear localisation has been reported [ 51 ] , and TRIM11 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic [ 38 ] .
Therefore cytoplasmic PAX6 could potentially interact with all three proteins , while nuclear PAX6 could interact with TRIM11 and DNCL1 .
At the tissue level , HOMER3 expression has been detected in thymus and lung but it has mainly been studied in brain where it is found in the forebrain , hippocampus and cerebellum [ 39 ] .
DNCL1 and TRIM11 both have wide expression domains that include the brain [ 44,38 ] .
Thus the expression of all three interactors overlaps with PAX6 at the tissue level [ 2,7,8,10 ] .
We detected co-expression of PAX6 , HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 by RT-PCR in human adult brain <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> ( IH , L Harrison and A Brown , data not shown ) .
We demonstrated that the interaction between the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and HOMER3 or DNCL1 was impaired by three <termsem="SO:0000782"> naturally occurring </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> that are located in the PAX6 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> .
The Q422R <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> , which involves a <termsem="SO:0001448"> glutamine </term> to <termsem="SO:0001451"> arginine </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitution </term> at the last <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> of PAX6 , caused a reduction in the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 .
The X423L and 1615del10 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> severely reduced or completely abolished the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 .
The predicted effect of the X423L and 1615del10 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> is to cause translation into the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> , thus generating proteins with abnormal extensions that might be expected to disrupt the conformation of the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal end </term> of the protein .
The 1615del10 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> also <termsem="SO:0000045"> removes </term> the last 5 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> of the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> [ 28 ] .
None of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> affected the interaction with TRIM11 , suggesting that they do not alter the conformation of the more <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> part </term> of the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
All our data are consistent with the hypothesis that TRIM11 does not interact with the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> , but interacts with the PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> between the homeodomain and the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> .
Most aniridia patients are heterozygous for <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> that introduce a premature <termsem="SO:0000319"> termination codon </term> into the PAX6 <termsem="SO:0000236"> open reading frame </term> [ 2,52 ] .
These <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> would be expected to encode truncated proteins or no protein at all if the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay [ 52 ] .
We propose that the brain anomalies that have been observed in aniridia patients may be partly explained by impaired interaction between PAX6 and HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The neurobehavioural phenotype associated with 1615del10 and the polymicrogyria associated with X423L may result from a specific effect of these unusual <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> extension <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
There is evidence that signalling and transport mechanisms that were initially characterized in the brain may also be conserved in the retina , suggesting that impaired PAX6 protein-protein interactions may also have implications for the retinal defects observed in individuals with PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> [ 53,54 ] .
We have presented preliminary evidence that the neurodevelopmental transcriptional regulator PAX6 interacts with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
We suggest that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 is a mechanism by which synaptic signalling could lead to regulated changes in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression in neurons .
We also propose that some of the neural anomalies in patients with PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> may be explained by impaired protein-protein interactions .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> database searches were carried out using the BLAST program available through the Bioinformatics Applications at the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research [ 24 ] .

All <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> and <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> numbering is based on the human PAX6 cDNA and protein reference sequences available from the Human PAX6 <termsem="SO:0001023"> Allelic Variant </term> Database web site [ 27 ] .

PAX6PST contains the whole PST <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> 278 -- 422 of the full-length PAX6 protein ) .

This was made by cutting PAX6PST with NdeI and NotI to drop out the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> , and <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserting </term> a <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> linker between the two <termsem="SO:0000061"> restriction sites </term> .

Yeast two-hybrid library screens .
A mouse brain <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library ( ProQuest , Invitrogen ) was screened with the PAX6PST and PAX6CTP pDBLeu <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> .
The library was constructed in the pPC86 <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , which produces proteins fused to the yeast GAL4 activation <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
The system uses three GAL4-activated reporter <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , HIS3 , URA3 and lacZ , to identify positive interactions .
Reporters are activated when the bait protein fused to the GAL4 <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( pDBLeu ) interacts with the prey protein fused to the GAL4 activation <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( pPC86 ) , thus reconstituting GAL4 function .
HIS3 activation allows growth on plates lacking histidine .
Weak URA3 activation suppresses growth on plates containing 5-fluro-orotic acid while strong URA3 activation permits growth on plates lacking uracil .
LacZ activation causes X-gal to turn blue in a beta-galactosidase assay .
All assays were carried out in parallel with the five ProQuest control yeast strains A-E , which range from non-interactor ( A ) to strong interactor ( E ) .
All procedures were carried out according to the supplier 's protocols .
Briefly , chemically competent MaV203 yeast cells were co-transformed with the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library and the bait <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> pDBLeu PAX6CTP or pDBLeu PAX6PST .
Transformants ( 5  107 ) were plated on medium lacking histidine to check for HIS3 activation .
HIS3 positives were then assayed for all 3 reporters .
The pPC86 prey <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> was isolated from all HIS3/URA3/LacZ positives and the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000667"> insert </term> sequenced .
BLAST searches were performed to identify the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000667"> insert </term> [ 24 ] .
Specific interactions were tested by transforming competent MaV203 yeast cells with one bait <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> ( in pDBLeu ) and one prey <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> ( in pPC86 ) and testing the resulting colonies for activation of the HIS3 , URA3 and LacZ reporters as before .
To create a full-length Homer3 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clone </term> for pairwise tests , a <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clone </term> ( IMAGE <termsem="SO:0000151"> clone </term> 3602414 , accession number BE569374 ) containing the missing <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> 70 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> was identified by a BLAST search of the <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST <termsem="SO:0000348"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> </term> sequence </term> database and obtained from the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research .
