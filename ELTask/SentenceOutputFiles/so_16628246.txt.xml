Loss of Atrx Affects Trophoblast Development and the Pattern of X-Inactivation in Extraembryonic Tissues .
ATRX is an X-encoded member of the SNF2 family of ATPase/helicase proteins thought to regulate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression by modifying chromatin at target <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> .
<termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutations </term> in ATRX provided the first example of a human <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> disease associated with defects in such proteins .
To better understand the role of ATRX in development and the associated abnormalities in the ATR-X ( alpha thalassemia mental retardation , X-linked ) syndrome , we conditionally inactivated the <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> in mice , Atrx , at the 8 - to 16-cell stage of development .
The protein , Atrx , was ubiquitously expressed , and male embryos null for Atrx implanted and gastrulated normally but did not survive beyond 9.5 days postcoitus due to a defect in formation of the extraembryonic trophoblast , one of the first terminally differentiated lineages in the developing embryo .
Carrier female mice that inherit a maternal null <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> should be affected , since the paternal X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> is normally inactivated in extraembryonic tissues .
Surprisingly , however , some carrier females established a normal placenta and appeared to escape the usual pattern of imprinted X-inactivation in these tissues .
Together these findings demonstrate an unexpected , specific , and essential role for Atrx in the development of the murine trophoblast and present an example of escape from imprinted X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> inactivation .
ATRX belongs to a class of proteins that may modify how <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> is packaged into chromatin , altering the accessibility of other proteins in the nucleus to <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
In this way , ATRX is thought to influence <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression .
<termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutations </term> in the ATRX <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , which is located on the female sex <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> ( X ) , provided the first example of a human disease ( ATR-X syndrome ) associated with defects in such proteins .
Affected males ( XMUTY ) have multiple developmental abnormalities in a wide variety of systems .
Currently , it is not understood how proteins like ATRX influence cell biology .
To address this question , the authors <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> the <termsem="SO:0001060"> version </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in mice , Atrx .
Although affected male mice ( XMUTY ) started to develop normally , they died early in development because they failed to form a normal placenta .
In the placenta , female mice normally inactivate the X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> that they inherit from their fathers ( Xp ) , so if females inherit from their mother an X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> ( Xm ) that bears the abnormal copy of Atrx ( XmMUTXp ) , one would predict that , like affected males , they would fail to form a normal placenta .
The authors unexpectedly found this not to be so .
They showed , instead , that in such females the normal , paternally derived Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is active .
This study has therefore demonstrated an important facet of X - <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> imprinting .
ATR-X syndrome is a severe , nonprogressive form of X-linked mental retardation that is frequently associated with multiple congenital abnormalities [ 1 ] .
It is usually associated with a mild form of -thalassaemia , caused by reduced expression of structurally intact -globin <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , and characterised by the presence of -globin tetramers ( haemoglobin H inclusion bodies ) in peripheral red blood cells .
Carrier females occasionally manifest haemoglobin H inclusions , but are otherwise intellectually and physically normal .
Studies of X - <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> inactivation in carrier females have demonstrated preferential inactivation of the <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> bearing the abnormal <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in a variety of tissues [ 2 ] , and this skewing of X-inactivation is thought to explain the mild phenotype observed in carriers .
The ATR-X syndrome is caused by <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( ATRX ) that comprises 36 <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> spanning 300 kb of <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> at <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> Xq13 .3 [ 3 ] .
This <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encodes two dominant protein <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> ( Figure 1 ) .
As well as the full-length ATRX protein of ~ 280 kDa , which is encoded by a <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> of ~ 10 kb , we recently demonstrated that a truncated <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> called ATRXt ( ~ 200 kDa ) is produced from a <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> of around 7 kb , which arises when <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 11 fails to be spliced from the <termsem="SO:0000185"> primary transcript </term> and an alternative <termsem="SO:0000188"> intronic </term> <termsem="SO:0000551"> <termsem="SO:0000610"> poly ( A ) </term> signal </term> is used [ 4 ] .
The mouse <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> of the ATRX <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , Atrx , is also situated on the X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> , and also gives rise to full-length ( Atrx , ~ 280 kDa ) and truncated ( Atrxt , ~ 200 kDa ) <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> [ 4,5 ] .
Disease-causing missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> are clustered in two regions of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> : a PHD-like zinc finger <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and a SNF2-like ATPase <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( Figure 1 ) [ 6 ] .
The former motif is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions in chromatin [ 7 ] , and the latter is a <termsem="SO:0000110"> feature </term> of chromatin-remodelling proteins , and the presence of disease-causing <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> indicates the functional importance of these <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
ATRX has been shown to remodel chromatin [ 8 ] .
It also interacts with HP1 at heterochromatin [ 9 ] and is recruited to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies via an interaction with Daxx [ 10 ] .
Furthermore , disruption of ATRX leads to diverse changes in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> methylation [ 11 ] .
Nevertheless , the role ATRX plays in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression remains unclear .
The consistent core of clinical and haematological features observed in ATR-X patients suggests that , like the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin-remodelling protein , ATRX probably regulates transcription of a discrete set of target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
However , although there are clearly others to be found , at present the -globin <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> remain the only confirmed targets for transcriptional regulation by ATRX .
Little is currently known about the precise role of the ATRX protein during mammalian development .
To investigate the role of this protein during mouse development , we generated a conditionally <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> of the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells , and used these cells to examine the effect of ablating expression of the full-length Atrx protein in ES cells and in mouse embryos .
Generation of ES Cells Lacking Full-Length Atrx .
Like the human <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , the mouse Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is also X-linked , such that a direct disruption of the single Atrx <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in male ES cells would immediately give rise to the null state .
No targeted <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were recovered after attempted homologous recombination in male E14TG2a ES cells using two different <termsem="SO:0000440"> vectors </term> that <termsem="SO:0000045"> removed </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 18 of the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000147"> Exon </term> 18 encodes the first of the seven motifs composing the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> SNF2-like <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of Atrx ( Figure 1 ) ; <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of the corresponding motif of the yeast SNF2 protein has been shown to severely impair SWI/SNF-dependent <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression [ 12 ] .
The failure to recover targeted <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> with these <termsem="SO:0000440"> vectors </term> suggested that Atrx may be important for normal ES cell growth and expansion and that direct targeting of the single <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> may not be possible .
We therefore adopted a conditional strategy for targeting <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 18 ( Figure 2 ) and recovered two <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> in which <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 18 has been <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP recognition sites </term> for the Cre recombinase ( Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in Figure 2A ) ( Figure 2B ) .
This <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> also contains a <termsem="SO:0000359"> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> - flanked </term> MC1-neor <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 17 ( Figure 2A ) .
Northern and Western blot analyses ( Figure 2D and 2E ) confirmed that the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> continued to express both full-length Atrx protein and the truncated Atrxt <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> .
To generate the full <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> in ES cells , the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ( 1/F12 and 1/G11 ) were transiently transfected with a Cre-recombinase expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> ( pCAGGS-Cre-IRESpuro ) , and subclones were recovered bearing an <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( Atrx18neo in Figure 2A ) in which both <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 18 and the neor <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> had been <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> by the Cre recombinase ( resulting from the recombination event labelled `` C '' in the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> shown in Figure 2A ) ( Figure 2C ) .
Northern and Western blot analyses ( Figure 2D and 2E ) revealed that the full-length Atrx <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> and protein is completely <termsem="SO:0000045"> abolished </term> in the Atrx18neo recombinant <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> , suggesting that <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> has a highly destabilising effect on the full-length <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> .
As expected , the truncated Atrxt <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> , the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> of which is terminated within <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 11 [ 4 ] , is unaffected by the <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 18 ( Figure 2E ) .
While the function of Atrxt is not yet clear , this <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> , which contains the PHD-like <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> but not the SWI/SNF motifs ( Figure 1 ) , is unlikely to be functionally equivalent to the full-length protein .
Thus , a conditional knockout strategy allowed the isolation of ES cells that are null for full-length Atrx .
Perturbed Growth and Methylation Defects in Atrxnull ES Cells .
Atrxnull ES cells could be maintained in culture but were generally slower growing than Atrx + ES clones , and appeared to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation .
We investigated directly the effect of Atrx on ES cell growth by comparing Atrx + and Atrxnull ES cell clones in competition cultures .
Equal numbers of Atrx + ( bearing either an AtrxWT or an Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ) and Atrxnull ( bearing an Atrx18neo <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ) ES cells were inoculated into cultures and the mixed cultures were passaged ( 1:3 split ) every 2 d for 8 -- 10 d .
The relative abundance of the different <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> in the culture at each time point was analysed by Southern blotting ( Figure 3A ) .
The clone containing the Atrx18neo <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was rapidly outgrown by both AtrxWT ES cells and cells bearing the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
In a control competition experiment between different clones bearing functional Atrx <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> ( AtrxWT and Atrxflox ) , both clones continued to be equally represented after 8 d of cocultivation .
Thus , although Atrxnull ES cells could be recovered and maintained in culture by a conditional targeting approach , these cocultivation experiments suggested that the absence of Atrx does negatively impact upon normal ES cell growth .
To investigate a possible cell-cycle defect in the absence of Atrx , we analysed the cell cycle distribution of bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) - pulsed ES cells by flow cytometry ( Figure S1A ) .
Surprisingly , both Atrxnull ES cell clones exhibited a cell cycle profile that was indistinguishable from ES cells bearing a functional Atrx <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox ) .
We also specifically quantitated the mitotic index within each population by flow cytometry after staining ES cells for phosphorylated ( Ser10 ) histone H3 , a specific marker of mitosis ( Figure S1B ) [ 13 ] .
Consistent with the normal cell-cycle profile observed above , there was no depletion in the size of the mitotic population in the Atrxnull ES clones , despite their slow growth .
Finally , we investigated whether the growth defect in the Atrxnull ES cells was due to an up-regulation of apoptosis by staining cells with Annexin V ( Figure S2 ) and found that the proportion of apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the absence of full-length Atrx .
Thus , the growth defect observed in ES cells lacking Atrx is not due to a specific cell cycle block or significant induction of cell death .
While the cause of the proliferative delay is not yet clear , since Atrxnull ES cells appear to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation ( unpublished data ) , it seems likely that the observed growth defect reflects the spontaneous transition from fast-cycling , undifferentiated ES cells into more slowly cycling , differentiated cell types in these cultures .
It has been shown that disease-causing <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in the human ATRX <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> give rise to changes in the normal pattern of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> methylation at several <termsem="SO:0000657"> repetitive sequences </term> within the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> [ 11 ] .
Notably , the transcribed region of the ribosomal <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> ( rDNA ) <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat </term> </term> was found to be significantly hypomethylated in ATR-X patients relative to normal individuals .
Using methylation-sensitive restriction <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> , we also observed significant hypomethylation at several <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> tested within the mouse rDNA <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> in Atrxnull ES cells and 12-d embryoid bodies relative to ES cells and embryoid bodies bearing a functional Atrx <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( AtrxWT or Atrxflox ) ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx , even in ES cells , is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR-X patients .
Other mouse <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repetitive sequence elements </term> </term> surveyed in ES cell <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> include the heterochromatic major satellite ( assayed with MaeII ) and minor satellite ( assayed with HpaII ) <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> , as well as interspersed retroviral <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of the intracisternal A particle ( IAP ) type and the Line 1 and Sine B1 families ( all assayed with HpaII ) .
These <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> were found to be moderately ( Line 1 and Sine B1 ) or highly ( IAP , major <termsem="SO:0000005"> satellite </term> , minor <termsem="SO:0000005"> satellite </term> ) methylated in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ES cells , and this methylation was not detectably perturbed by the absence of Atrx ( Figure S3 and unpublished data ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that the subtle interplay between the ATRX protein and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> methylation observed in human patients is also present in mouse cells .
Early Embryonic Lethality in Atrxnull Male Mice .
To investigate the role of the Atrx protein during mouse development , we initially established lines of mice bearing the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Two independently targeted Atrxflox ES cell clones with normal male karyotype were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to produce chimaeric mice , which were then used to obtain germline transmission .
Intercrosses between males hemizygous ( Atrxflox/Y ) and females heterozygous ( AtrxWT / <termsem="SO:0000359"> flox </term> ) for the <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were also carried out to generate homozygous females ( Atrxflox / <termsem="SO:0000359"> flox </term> ) .
Males hemizygous and females heterozygous or homozygous for the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were viable , appeared healthy , and bred normally , suggesting that , as expected , the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was functionally normal .
To generate Atrxnull mice by Cre-mediated recombination , the Atrxflox mice were crossed with mice harboring a <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the <termsem="SO:0005836"> regulatory elements </term> of the mouse GATA-1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( GATA1-cre ) [ 14 ] .
Widespread expression of the GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> has been demonstrated during early embryogenesis [ 14 ] .
We more accurately defined the onset of GATA1-cre expression using a ROSA26 reporter strain , in which a -galactosidase/neor <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> reporter gene is expressed only after Cre-mediated <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> of <termsem="SO:0000359"> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> - flanked </term> transcription and <termsem="SO:0000319"> translation termination signals </term> [ 14 ] .
We found that the GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> was already active at the 16-cell morula stage of development ( 0.5 days postcoitus [ dpc ] ) ( Figure 4A ) .
To generate Atrxnull mice , heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> females ( AtrxWT / <termsem="SO:0000359"> flox </term> ) were mated with homozygous GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> males ( AtrxWT/Y ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) .
No Atrxnull males ( Atrxnull/Y ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  ) were recovered at birth , indicating that the absence of Atrx results in embryonic lethality .
This finding was unexpected , since human ATR-X patients clearly survive to adulthood ( see Discussion ) .
Embryos were dissected at 7.5 , 8.5 , and 9.5 dpc and genotyped by PCR analysis of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> extracted from yolk sac or total embryo ( Figure 4B and Protocol S1 ) .
Atrxnull males were present at expected mendelian ratios ( ~ 25 % ) at both 7.5 dpc and 8.5 dpc ( Table 1 ) .
However , by 9.5 dpc , depletion was observed both in the number of Atrxnull males ( 7 % ) and in the total number of males recovered ( 31 % ) .
No Atrxnull males were recovered after 9.5 dpc .
Thus the absence of Atrx gives rise to embryonic lethality in mice before 9.5 dpc .
To investigate the morphology of Atrxnull embryos prior to death , embryos from the above crosses were initially dissected in their deciduas at 7.5 dpc , and paraffin sections were stained with haematoxylin ( Figure 5A ) or with an anti-ATRX antibody ( Figure 5B -- 5E ) .
Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Atrx was widely expressed in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> 7.5 dpc embryos ( Figure 5B ) .
Expression was highest in the embryonic region ( Figure 5C ) and the chorion ( Figure 5D ) .
Detectable but lower levels of expression were observed in the ectoplacental cone ( Figure 5D ) and surrounding decidual tissue .
We also observed very high levels of Atrx expression in trophoblast giant cells ( TGCs ) surrounding the Reichert 's membrane ( Figure 5E ) .
Within the large nuclei of these TGCs , the typical nuclear association of Atrx with blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin [ 15 ] was clearly observable .
Only background staining was seen in the corresponding Atrxnull embryonic tissues ( Figure 5B -- 5D ) , while expression in the surrounding decidual tissue ( of maternal origin ) was normal and served as an antibody staining control ( unpublished data ) .
Morphologically , 7.5 dpc Atrxnull embryos were dramatically reduced in size and appeared developmentally retarded relative to stage-matched <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> embryos ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
However , despite their reduced size , the general morphology and organisation of embryonic structures in Atrxnull conceptuses appeared grossly normal .
The amnion and chorion were clearly present and the amniotic , exocoelomic , and ectoplacental cavities were distinguishable , as were all three embryonic germ layers ( Figure 5A -- 5C ) .
At 8.5 dpc , embryos were dissected free of deciduas , and observed in whole mount .
Individual conceptuses were genotyped by PCR using <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> isolated from yolk sac as described in Protocol S1 .
Consistent with observations at 7.5 dpc , the general morphology of the embryo proper of Atrxnull conceptuses also appeared grossly normal at 8.5 dpc .
The head fold had clearly formed , and expression of the early mesoderm marker brachyury ( T ) [ 16 ] was detected in the primitive streak and emerging notochord by whole-mount in situ hybridisation ( WMISH ) ( Figure 5F ) , indicating that Atrxnull embryos had gastrulated .
To investigate whether the reduced size of the Atrxnull embryos was due to an increase in apoptosis , we analysed sections of paraffin-embedded 7.5 dpc embryos by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) assay ( Figure 6A ) .
Very few apoptotic cells were detected in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> 7.5 dpc embryos .
In Atrxnull embryos , a slight increase in the apoptotic population was evident .
However , consistent with our observation of a grossly normal apoptotic index in Atrxnull ES cells ( Figure S2 ) , the apoptotic response observed in Atrxnull embryos was also not uniform , but was restricted to a low number of scattered TUNEL-positive cells .
Since this small apoptotic response is unlikely to account fully for the dramatic size deficit observed in Atrxnull embryos , a possible proliferation defect was also investigated by immunohistochemical staining of 7.5 dpc embryo sections for the mitosis marker phosphorylated ( Ser10 ) histone H3 [ 13 ] .
Relative to the very high mitotic index observed in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> embryos , the proportion of mitotic cells observed in Atrxnull embryos at 7.5 dpc was dramatically reduced ( Figure 6B ) .
Taken together , these results suggest that the size deficit observed in Atrxnull embryos prior to lethality largely reflects a proliferative defect , with a minor but indirect contribution from increased apoptosis .
Although a growth defect was also observed in Atrxnull ES cells ( Figure 3A ) , in contrast to the Atrxnull embryos , the mitotic index of the ES cell population ( as measured with the same antibody ) was not depleted ( Figure S1B ) .
These observations suggest that the mitotic defect observed in embryos is unlikely to be a direct , cell-autonomous effect of the absence of Atrx , and is more likely to be a secondary effect resulting from the failure to develop a normal trophoblast ( see below ) .
Trophectoderm Failure in Atrxnull Embryos .
Whole-mount observation of 8.5 dpc embryos revealed that , in contrast to the basically normal although delayed morphology of the embryo itself , the extraembryonic tissues of Atrxnull conceptuses appeared highly disorganised .
When embryos were removed from deciduas , the surrounding trophectoderm layer appeared dramatically reduced in Atrxnull embryos relative to <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> littermates , and the underlying ectoplacental cone appeared reduced and abnormally shaped ( Figure 7A ) .
Vacated deciduas surrounding 8.5 dpc <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and Atrxnull embryos were bisected and analysed by WMISH for expression of placental lactogen-1 ( Pl-1 ) , a marker of terminally differentiated TGCs .
The number of Pl-1-expressing cells attached to the decidual wall after removal of the embryo is an indication of the density of trophoblast cells surrounding each implantation site [ 17 ] .
We found that the population of Pl-1-expressing cells was depleted in the decidual implantation sites containing Atrxnull embryos relative to those containing <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> littermates ( Figure 7B ) ; this was also apparent at 7.5 dpc , as determined by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin sections of embryos in deciduas with an anti-Pl-1 antibody ( Figure 7C ) .
A TGC deficiency in the absence of Atrx is consistent with the observation that Atrx is highly expressed in giant cells surrounding <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> 7.5 dpc embryos ( Figure 5E ) .
To investigate whether the trophoblast defect was restricted to the production of secondary TGCs ( produced by diploid precursors in the ectoplacental cone and derived originally from the polar trophectoderm overlying the inner cell mass of the blastocyst ) or also affected the production of primary TGCs ( resulting from differentiation of the mural trophectoderm of the blastocyst ) , blastocysts ( 3.5 dpc ) from crosses between AtrxWT / <termsem="SO:0000359"> flox </term> females and GATA1-Cre homozygous <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> males ( AtrxWT/Y ; GATA1-Cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) were cultured in vitro for 5 d to monitor outgrowth of the primary trophoblast .
After 5 d , individual blastocyst cultures were scored for the extent of primary trophoblast outgrowth , and the Atrx <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> and sex of the blastocyst were determined by PCR .
Most blastocysts hatched from the zona pellucida within 24 h , and trophoblast cells spreading out from the inner cell mass could usually be detected within 48 h of culture .
No difference was observed in the rate or extent of trophoblast outgrowth over 5 d of culture between Atrxnull blastocysts ( Atrxnull/Y , n = 6 ) and blastocysts bearing an AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( AtrxWT / <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> , n = 6 ; AtrxWT/null , n = 6 ; AtrxWT/Y , n = 6 ) ( examples shown in Figure 7D ) , suggesting that the defect specifically involves the secondary giant cell compartment .
This is consistent with the observation that Atrxnull conceptuses implant successfully and survive to gastrulation .
Taken together , these data suggest that loss of Atrx results in a defect in formation of the secondary trophoblast that is apparent from 7.5 dpc .
Despite initiating normal organisation in the embryo proper , Atrxnull conceptuses exhibit a proliferative defect by 7.5 dpc and die by around 9.5 dpc , probably due to a nutritional deficit resulting from failure to develop a normal trophoblast .
Escape from Imprinted Inactivation of the Paternally Inherited AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> Allele </term> in Extraembryonic Tissues of Carrier Female Mice .
Female mice carrying an Atrxnull <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( AtrxWT/null ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  ) were detected at 9.5 dpc ( Table 1 ) and recovered at birth ( unpublished data ) , although at both time points the number of carrier females was lower than that of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ( AtrxWT / <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  ) females , suggesting that a proportion of carrier female embryos died in utero .
Surviving adult carrier female mice were not phenotypically normal and exhibited mild behavioural abnormalities , although some could reproduce .
For all AtrxWT/null carrier female embryos presented in Table 1 , the AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was paternally derived , while the Atrxnull <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was maternally derived .
In the mouse , X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> inactivation is subject to parental imprinting in the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm lineages that give rise to the extraembryonic tissues , resulting in inactivation of the paternal X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> ( Xp ) [ 18 ] .
In contrast , in tissues of the embryo proper ( derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst ) X-inactivation is random [ 19 ] .
Thus , in the extraembryonic compartment of AtrxWT/null carrier females , normal imprinted X-inactivation would be expected to result in silencing of the paternally derived AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , leaving only the Atrxnull <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on the active maternal X ( Xm ) and thereby render the extraembryonic tissues null for full-length Atrx protein .
However , the absence of Atrx in the extraembryonic compartment is lethal in Atrxnull/Y males .
This suggested the possibility of an escape from imprinted inactivation of the paternally derived AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in the extraembryonic compartment of a proportion of carrier female embryos .
To investigate further , we crossed homozygous Atrxflox / <termsem="SO:0000359"> flox </term> females and homozygous GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> males ( AtrxWT/Y ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) , which would be expected to yield only Atrxnull males ( Atrxnull/Y ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  ) and carrier females ( AtrxWT/null ; GATA1-cre <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  ) .
In these carrier females , the AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is paternally inherited .
Embryos were dissected in their deciduas at 7.5 dpc , and paraffin sections were stained with anti-ATRX antibody , along with sections from a <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> 7.5 dpc embryo for comparison ( Figure 8 ) .
As described above , Atrx expression was detected in every cell in the epiblast ( embryo proper ) region of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> 7.5 dpc embryos ( Figure 8B ) .
In contrast , the epiblast region of carrier female embryos was composed of a mosaic of small clusters of Atrx-positive cells ( in which the Atrxnull <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on Xm had been inactivated ) and Atrx-negative cells ( in which the AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on Xp had been inactivated ) , indicating that the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was subject to normal random X-inactivation in the epiblast .
Remarkably , clear Atrx expression could also be detected in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females , as shown in the extraembryonic-derived chorionic ectoderm ( Figure 8C ) .
Atrx expression could be detected in almost all cells of the chorionic ectoderm .
Atrx expression was also clearly detected in other extraembryonic structures , including TGCs ( unpublished data ) .
Escape from silencing of an Xp-inherited AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was also observed in the chorionic ectoderm of carrier females at 8.5 dpc ( Figure S4 ) .
Thus , although random X-inactivation occurs normally within the epiblast , the AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( inherited on the Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> ) escaped the normal imprinted X-inactivation in the extraembryonic compartment of some carrier females .
We investigated the role of the Atrx protein in mouse development .
By using a conditional knockout approach , we ablated the full-length Atrx protein first in ES cells and embryoid bodies , and then in developing mouse embryos .
Atrx in ES Cells .
Atrxnull ES cells could not be recovered by direct targeting and were eventually generated by adopting a conditional targeting approach .
This is consistent with our observation that Atrx is highly expressed in ES cells , and that the absence of full-length Atrx imparts a growth disadvantage relative to cells bearing a functional Atrx <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
At present , the cause of the proliferative delay in Atrxnull ES cells is not known .
Interestingly , we demonstrated that apoptosis is not significantly up-regulated in ES cells lacking Atrx and is only mildly elevated in Atrxnull 7.5 dpc mouse embryos .
In contrast , it was recently shown that the loss of Atrx markedly increased the apoptotic population in the differentiating cells of the embryonic cortex and postnatal hippocampus , when Atrx expression was ablated in the developing mouse forebrain using the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> described here [ 20 ] .
The human ATRX protein has been shown to associate in a complex with Daxx [ 8 ] , a protein that has been implicated in multiple pathways for the regulation of apoptosis [ 21 ] .
It is possible that disruption of the mouse Atrx-Daxx complex ( by ablation of the Atrx protein ) could have triggered a universal proapoptotic response .
However , our observations in ES cells demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis is not an automatic response triggered by the removal of Atrx in all cell types , and suggest that the inappropriate apoptosis observed in the Atrx - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> forebrain may reflect a requirement for Atrx during terminal differentiation .
An Unexpected Role for Atrx in Development of the Mouse Trophoblast .
We show that Atrxnull male mice are not viable and embryos die by around 9.5 dpc .
Before death , Atrxnull embryos exhibit a markedly reduced mitotic index , suggesting a proliferative defect .
Although the embryonic compartment of the conceptus appears initially normal , by 7.5 dpc Atrxnull embryos display abnormalities in development of the trophoblast , including a depletion in the population of TGCs surrounding the conceptus and a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone , which contains the diploid giant cell precursors [ 22 ] .
TGCs are highly differentiated , postmitotic cells that ultimately form an epithelial layer at the periphery of the placenta , which interfaces with the maternal cells of the decidua [ 23 ] .
These highly invasive cells are important for mediating initial invasion of the uterine tissue , but are also involved in remodelling the maternal decidua after implantation and in secreting hormones that regulate fetal and maternal growth [ 24 ] .
Since Atrxnull embryos appear to implant normally , lethality is likely to arise due to a failure of TGC function later during development .
Embryonic lethality in mice in the absence of Atrx was a surprising finding , as there had been no suggestion of foetal loss in the human ATR-X syndrome .
It is possible that the role of Atrx in the trophoblast is specific to mice and that ATRX has no role or is redundant in the human trophoblast .
Indeed , the birth weight of babies with ATR-X syndrome is usually normal .
An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly severe phenotype we observed in mice is that the Atrx18neo <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> generated by Cre recombination completely ablates full-length Atrx protein ( Figure 2E ) .
In contrast , all disease-causing <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> characterised in human ATR-X pedigrees appear to give rise to hypomorphic <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
Some full-length ATRX protein is detected in cases predicted to have truncating <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> ( RJG , unpublished data ) , and residual ATPase activity in ATRX immunoprecipitates can be detected in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes of all human patients analysed to date ( A. Argentaro and M. Mitson , unpublished data ) .
The failure to observe a truly null ATRX <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> among human patients strongly suggests that , as in the mouse , the complete absence of ATRX protein is incompatible with human fetal survival .
While this study has revealed an unexpected role for Atrx in the murine trophectoderm , as a result of the early lethality observed in Atrxnull embryos it is not possible to rule out other roles for Atrx at later developmental stages in tissues of the embryo proper .
Indeed , we show that Atrx is highly expressed throughout the entire developing embryo at 7.5 dpc ( Figure 5B ) , and it is likely that Atrx function will turn out to be important for other differentiating tissues .
Tetraploid aggregation experiments ( in which <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos are rescued with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> extraembryonic tissues ) might shed more light on the role of Atrx during later mouse development , but these issues can be more subtly dissected by combining the conditional Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> that we have generated with different tissue-specific Cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenes </term> .
As mentioned above , this approach has already revealed a critical role for Atrx during neuronal differentiation in adult mice [ 20 ] .
Further evidence that Atrx is also required at later stages of mouse development is provided by the observed dramatic skewing against Atrx-negative cells in some somatic tissues of carrier female mice , whose tissues initially comprise a mosaic of Atrx-positive and Atrx-negative cells as a result of random X-inactivation ( M. Muers , personal communication ) .
Atrx joins an expanding list of mouse <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which targeted disruption results in peri-implantation lethality as a result of trophoblast or placental abnormalities ( reviewed in [ 25 ] ) .
Comparison with other phenotypes might provide some insight into the role of Atrx in trophoblast development .
Atrx - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos progress further than embryos nullizygous for factors involved in the initial specification of trophoblast stem cells ( such as Cdx2 ) or in stem cell maintenance and proliferation ( such as Eomes ) .
Cdx2 - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos fail to implant and die between 3.5 and 5.5 dpc [ 26 ] , while Eomes - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> blastocysts implant into the uterus , but arrest soon after implantation without forming organised embryonic or extraembryonic structures [ 27 ] .
In contrast , Atrx - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos implant successfully and establish organised embryonic structures by 7.5 dpc .
The Atrx - <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> phenotype closely resembles that observed in mice nullizygous for the basic <termsem="SO:0001114"> helix </term> - loop - <termsem="SO:0001114"> helix </term> transcription factor Hand1 .
Hand1 - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> conceptuses arrest at around 7.5 dpc and display a normal embryonic compartment , but , like Atrx - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos , ablation of Hand1 causes a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone and density of TGCs [ 28 ] .
As with Atrx <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , only arrested or resorbed Hand1 - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> conceptuses were recovered after 8.5 dpc .
Also like Atrx , disruption of Hand1 specifically affects secondary giant cell formation , and primary trophoblast outgrowths from blastocysts appeared normal .
Hand1 is required for terminal differentiation of secondary TGCs , and in its absence trophoblast cells arrest at a precursor stage in the ectoplacental cone [ 17,28 ] .
Given the similarity of the Atrx - and Hand1 - <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> phenotypes and the likelihood that Atrx acts as a transcriptional regulator by modifying chromatin structure , it will be of interest to determine whether Atrx is itself a regulator of Hand1 expression , or alternatively whether it acts as a co-regulator of one or more of the downstream transcriptional targets of Hand1 .
It is noteworthy that , in the brain-specific Atrx knockout mice , the defect was observed in terminally differentiating neurons [ 20 ] .
The secondary TGCs affected in the universal Atrx knockout reported here represent one of the first terminally differentiated tissues in the developing mouse , and this may point to the requirement for Atrx in the high-level expression of some tissue-specific <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> during the final stages of differentiation .
Interestingly , the -globin <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , the only confirmed transcriptional targets of regulation by human ATRX , are also highly expressed specifically during terminal differentiation within the erythroid lineage .
Atrx Escapes Imprinted X-Inactivation in Extraembryonic Tissues of Carrier Female Mice .
Another surprising finding of this study is that , in carrier female embryos , a paternally inherited AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> appears to escape the process of imprinted X-inactivation , which ordinarily silences the Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> in the extraembryonic compartment of female murine tissues [ 18 ] .
Silencing of the AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on Xp should render these females null for Atrx in the extraembryonic tissues , since the normally active Xm <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> carries the Atrx18neo <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Although not phenotypically normal , some Atrx carrier females developed to term and went on to reproduce .
Thus , the failure to correctly silence the paternally derived AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females is consistent with our observations that in Atrxnull males , the Atrx protein plays an essential role in the development of the trophoblast and is necessary for survival in utero in the mouse .
The survival of Atrx carrier females contrasts with the phenotypes seen in carriers of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> of other murine X-linked <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> known to be essential in the extraembryonic compartment .
For example , targeted disruption of the dyskerin ( Dkc1 ) , glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) , and choroideremia ( Chm ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> cause embryonic lethality in null male embryos through defects of the extraembryonic-derived tissues [ 29 -- 31 ] .
Female mice carrying <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> on the maternally inherited X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> also die in utero , whereas females that inherit the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> on the Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> survive .
Thus , unlike Atrx , these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and/or their effects on cell growth are unable to circumvent the processes that ultimately cause all cells in the extraembryonic tissues to express only the maternally derived X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> .
How might expression of the paternal AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> be maintained in the extraembryonic tissues of the Atrx carrier females ?
One possibility is that , like some other X-linked <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , silencing of the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> on Xp is incomplete , such that there is always a low-level , leaky output of Atrx from a normally inactivated Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> in extraembryonic tissues .
However , it was recently demonstrated that the paternal Atrx ( called Xnp ) <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is completely silenced in a normal mouse trophoblast stem cell line [ 32 ] , suggesting that Atrx does not normally escape imprinted X-inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> females .
Thus , the expression of the Xp-linked AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> that we observed is unique to female carriers of the Atrxnull <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Perhaps a more likely explanation for this phenomenon stems from experimental observations suggesting that imprinted X-inactivation is not imposed on all precursors of the mouse extraembryonic tissues : A subpopulation of cells may escape this process and make a random `` choice '' of which X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> will be inactivated .
On average , 50 % of the cells in this randomly inactivating subpopulation would be expected to maintain an active Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> .
In support of this hypothesis , it has been demonstrated that expression of paternally transmitted X-linked lacZ [ 33,34 ] and GFP [ 35 ] <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenes </term> failed to be silenced in a small subpopulation of extraembryonic cells .
Further , it has been shown that in a subpopulation of extraembryonic cells , it is the Xm rather than the Xp that undergoes late replication , a molecular correlate of the inactive state [ 18,36 ] .
Although initially small and quickly diluted in normal embryos , the cellular subpopulation that inactivates the Xm <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> could rapidly expand to replace the normally imprinted cells in extraembryonic lineages if the normal silencing of Xp compromises cell growth or differentiation .
Interestingly , it has been suggested that the size of the population that initially escapes imprinting may range widely ( from 0 % to 30 % ) , even between <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> identical embryos [ 37 ] , and this may account for the variable phenotype observed among females bearing Xm-linked <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> essential for normal extraembryonic development [ 38 ] .
Put simply , carrier females bearing a small initial population of escaping cells would be more severely affected than those bearing a larger population .
This could explain why we have observed significant phenotypic variation among Atrx carrier females , with some carriers dying in utero by 9.5 dpc ( Table 1 ) and others developing to term .
Another possible mechanism is that inactivation of the paternal X proceeds normally in all cells , but subsequently the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> within individual cells is reactivated .
Alternatively , in the absence of Atrx , the paternal <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> may partially escape the normal process of silencing .
In both of these cases , other <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> on the paternal X <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> must be inactivated and remain so , since blocking inactivation of the entire Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> causes embryonic lethality due to biallelic expression of X-linked <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the trophoblast [ 39 ] .
ATR-X syndrome is the first human <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> disease known to be caused by <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in a chromatin remodelling factor .
At present we do not know how ATRX influences <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression or what effect it has on cell behaviour .
Nevertheless , we have previously noted that none of the <termsem="SO:0000782"> natural </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> causing ATR-X syndrome are nulls , which suggests that it plays a critical role in normal development .
Results of conditional inactivation of Atrx in the developing mouse forebrain , based on the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> described here , shows that Atrx exerts a major effect on terminally differentiating neurons .
Conditional inactivation of Atrx in other tissues is underway .
Here we have shown that animal-wide disruption of the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> causes a severe embryonic-lethal phenotype , revealing an essential role for Atrx in the formation of the murine trophoblast .
In addition , Atrx appears to escape imprinted X - <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of some carrier female mice .
Generation of ES cells bearing the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Briefly , the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> ( shown in Figure 2A ) places a <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP site </term> within <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 18 and a <termsem="SO:0000359"> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> - flanked </term> MC1neopA selection <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 17 of the Atrx <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .

Cre-recombination and characterisation of Atrxnull ES cells and embryoid bodies .
ES cell clones bearing the Atrxflox <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( 1  107 cells ) were transiently transfected with 50 g of uncut Cre expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> ( pCAGGS-Cre-IRESpuro ) [ 40 ] .
Following transfection , cells were plated at a range of clonal densities in complete medium without G418 , and isolated subclones were picked after 7 d. Subclones were expanded and analysed for the presence of a recombinant <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> initially by PCR , to detect <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of the MC1neopA <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> , and then by Southern blot and hybridisation with the <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 17 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> described above ( Figure 2A and 2C ) .
Northern blots were carried out according to standard techniques using 20 g of total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> isolated using TRI Reagent ( Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) .

After it was stripped , the membrane was hybridised with a -actin <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> ( Clontech , Palo Alto , California , United States ) .
Protein extraction and detection of Atrx by Western blotting was performed as described previously [ 4 ] , using the mouse monoclonal anti-ATRX antibody 23C [ 15 ] .

Immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridisation , and TUNEL assay .
7.5 dpc decidual swellings were dissected away from maternal tissue and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight at 4 C .
After embryos were washed thoroughly in PBS , they were dehydrated through an ethanol series and xylene , embedded in paraffin , and sectioned at 5 m .
Sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using the ABC Staining System ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , California , United States ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ATRX ( H-300 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , Placental lactogen-I ( AB1288 , Chemicon International , Temecula , California , United States ) and phospho ( Ser10 ) - histone H3 ( 06 -- 570 , Upstate Biotechnology , Waltham , Massachusetts , United States ) .
Where appropriate , adjacent sections were stained with haematoxylin .
In some cases , adjacent sections were also analysed to detect apoptotic cells by TUNEL using the in situ cell death detection kit ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) .
After labelling , these slides were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI ( <termsem="SO:0000440"> Vector </term> Laboratories , Burlingame , California , United States ) and visualised by fluorescence microscopy .
Whole-mount in situ hybridisations were performed on 8.5 dpc embryos ( dissected away from maternal and extraembryonic tissues ) using a brachyury ( T ) riboprobe [ 16 ] and on bisected decidual implantation sites from which embryos ( 8.5 dpc ) had been removed using a placental lactogen-1 ( Pl-1 ) riboprobe ( see Protocol S1 for details ) .

Escape from Imprinted Inactivation in 8.5 dpc Carrier Female Embryo .
A cross was carried out between a carrier female ( AtrxWT/null ) and <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> male ( AtrxWT/Y ) , and embryos were dissected in their deciduas at 8.5 dpc .
Any carrier female progeny of this cross will carry an AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on the Xp <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> and an Atrxnull <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on the Xm <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> .
Transverse paraffin sections were stained with the anti-ATRX antibody ( H-300 ) .
( A ) High-magnification image ( 400  ) of the neural fold region ( nf ) ( embryo proper ) of a carrier female ( AtrxWT/null ) embryo .
This tissue is clearly comprised of a mosaic of Atrx-positive and Atrx-negative cells due to random X-inactivation .
This section was counterstained with haematoxylin .
( B ) High-magnification image ( 400  ) of the same embryo depicted in ( A ) , showing the extraembryonic derived-chorionic ectoderm ( ce ) and visceral endoderm ( ve ) , two tissues that undergo imprinted X-inactivation .
Although Atrx is poorly expressed in the visceral endoderm ( even in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> females [ unpublished data ] ) , strong expression of Atrx can be seen in the chorionic ectoderm , indicating that the paternally-derived AtrxWT <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> had escaped inactivation in this tissue .
