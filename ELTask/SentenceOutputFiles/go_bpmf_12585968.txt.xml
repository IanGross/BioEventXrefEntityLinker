Brn3c null mutant mice show long-term , incomplete retention of some afferent inner ear innervation .
Ears of Brn3c null mutants <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> immature hair cells , identifiable only by certain molecular markers , and undergo <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in neonates .
This partial <termsem="GO:0060119"> development of hair cells </term> could lead to enough neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> to sustain <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons through <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> .
We have therefore investigated in these mutants the patterns of innervation and of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of known neurotrophins .
At <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> there is a limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BDNF and NT-3 in the mutant <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia and DiI tracing shows no specific reduction of afferents or efferents that resembles neurotrophin null mutations .
At postnatal day 7/8 ( P7/8 ) , innervation is severely reduced both qualitatively and quantitatively .
1 % of myosin VIIa-positive immature hair cells are present in the mutant cochlea , concentrated in the base .
Around 20 % of immature hair cells exist in the mutant vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia .
Despite more severe loss of hair cells ( 1 % compared to 20 % ) , the cochlea retains many more <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons ( 46 % compared to 15 % ) than vestibular epithelia .
Even 6 months old mutant mice have some fibers to all vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia and many more to the cochlear apex which lacks MyoVIIa positive hair cells .
Topologically <termsem="GO:0048532"> organized </term> central cochlea projections exist at least until P8 , suggesting that functional hair cells are not required to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> such projections .
The limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of neurotrophins in the cochlea of Brn3c null mice suffices to support many <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons , particularly in the cochlea , until <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
The molecular nature of the long term survival of apical spiral neurons remains unclear .

Brn3c is a POU domain factor that is crucial for <termsem="GO:0060119"> inner ear hair cell development </term> .
Targeted null Brn3c mutants have no mature hair cells [ 1,2 ] .
Close examination has revealed that some ` immature ' hair cells <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in Brn3c null mutants and <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> cellular markers such as Myosin VI and VIIa , calretinin and parvalbumin [ 3 ] .
Furthermore , these immature hair cells of Brn3c null mutants undergo <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in neonates [ 3 ] .
Consistent with an apparent absence of mature hair cells , initial work suggested that all vestibular and most spiral ganglion cells are lost by postnatal day 14 ( P14 ; [ 1 ] ) .
However , more detailed quantification by others [ 3 ] reported that at P4 about 77 % of vestibular neurons and only 29 % of spiral neurons are lost .
It was suggested that there is possibly a complete loss in adults [ 3 ] .
Other than these preliminary statements , no data exists concerning the detailed pattern of loss of innervation in Brn3c null mutants .
The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in these cells to sustain <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons through <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> and beyond .
Data on various single and compound neurotrophin null mutants have shown that the loss of a specific neurotrophin leads to topologically restricted loss of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in the embryonic ear [ 4,5 ] .
Such selective loss in Brn3c null mutants would therefore indicate reduction of a specific neurotrophin in immature hair cells .
Moreover , recent work shows that in embryos NT-3 is primarily <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in supporting cells , <termsem="GO:0006810"> moving </term> only around <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> into hair cells [ 6,7 ] .
In fact , the selective loss of vestibular as compared to cochlear <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons ( 77 % versus 29 % ; [ 3 ] ) suggests that NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> may be less <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in Brn3c null mutants than BDNF [ 6,8,9 ] , provided that at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes place .
In the ear [ 4 ] as well as elsewhere [ 10 ] neurotrophins are progressively <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in postnatal mammals and possibly replaced by other factors [ 11 ] .
We have investigated in detail the pattern of innervation in the Brn3c mutants , as well as the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of NT-3 and BDNF .
We want to evaluate a possible correlation between the topology of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neuron loss and absence of a specific neurotrophin or topological loss of hair cells at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and in older animals .
This information could be important for an in-depth evaluation of the human deafness related to the Pou4f3 gene , DFNA15 [ 12 ] .
We report here long term retention of cochlear <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons for at least 6 months , in particular in the cochlear apex , in Brn3c null mutant mice .
This retention of afferents and efferents is unrelated to hair <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> as not even immature hair cells can be detected at early postnatal stages with MyoVII immunocytochemistry in this part of the cochlea .
This retention of apical spiral neurons is also largely unrelated to neurotrophins which are known to be reduced in their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in neonatal rodents [ 4 ] .
To appreciate the effects of the Brn3c null mutation on the pattern of the inner ear innervation , we first want to present the effects of BDNF and NT-3 null mutations at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> [ 6,13,14 ] .
Null mutants of BDNF or its <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> trkB lose all innervation to the semicircular canals and have a reduced innervation to the utricle , saccule and apical turn of the cochlea .
In contrast , null mutations of either NT-3 or its <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> trkC result in loss of spiral neurons in the basal turn with <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of an inner spiral bundle of afferents extending to the basal tip .
Our null hypothesis for this study would be that Brn3c null mice show severe compromised <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> of these neurotrophins and should therefore show a comparable pattern of nerve fiber loss .
Brn3c null mutants at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( P0 ) .
Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 1b ) than in control littermates ( Fig. 1a ) , but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age [ 13,15 ] .
The reduction in apparent size of the vestibular ganglia is in agreement with quantitative data published previously [ 3,13 ] .
These data suggest a loss of 80 -- 85 % of vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in BDNF and trkB null mutants [ 13 ] and of 77 % of vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in P4 Brn3c null mutants [ 3 ] .
Thus , the size reduction in the vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> ganglion could be compatible with a loss of BDNF <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> in the immature hair cells .
Size variations of vestibular ganglia in control and mutant littermates labeled with DiI .
In newborn animals , the vestibular ganglion shows a dramatic reduction in Brn3c null mutants ( b ) compared to control littermates ( a ) .

However , the Brn3c null mutants show only a reduced density of afferent and efferent fibers to all vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia .
There is no specific loss of all afferent and efferent innervation to the canal crista ( Fig. 2a ) , a hallmark of both BDNF and trkB null mutations [ 13,15 ] .
In fact , the reduction of fibers seems to be rather uniform throughout a given <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelium with the crista innervation being qualitatively no more reduced than the innervation of the utricle and saccule .
No loss in specific areas , comparable to that in BDNF null mutant mice , is apparent in the saccule or utricle of Brn3c null mice .
Similar patterns of innervation are obtained using <termsem="GO:0006473"> acteylated </term> tubulin immunocytochemistry ( Fig. 2b ) .
Innervation of Brn3c null and control ears are shown for newborn mice .
There is no specific loss of fibers to any vestibular endorgan , as visualized by DiI labeling ( a ) or <termsem="GO:0006473"> acetylated </term> tubulin immunoreactivity ( b ) .
No major differences in pattern of projection through radial fibers are found in the cochlea of Brn3c null mutants ( d , f ) as compared to control littermates ( c ) .
Note , however , the lack of orderly fiber outgrowth to the outer hair cells ( c , d ) .
Efferent fibers to the ear show a well <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> intraganglionic spiral bundle ( IGSB ) with no detectable differences compared to controls ( e ) .
Bar indicates 100 m .
Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al. [ 3 ] of only a 29 % loss of spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons at P4 , our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 2c ,2 d ) .
No selective loss of spiral neurons is observed in Brn3c null mutants in the basal turn , a feature of either NT-3 or trkC loss [ 6,9,14 ] .
Likewise , the innervation of the apex ( Fig. 2f ) shows no detectable abnormality in overall pattern of innervation compared to control animals ( data not shown ) , an indication that BDNF could be <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the apex [ 6 ] .
In addition , the pattern of efferent innervation shows no deviation from normal either ( Fig. 2e ) , whereas they show the same pattern of loss as afferent fibers in neurotrophin null mutants [ 16 ] .
These data suggest that the spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> qualitatively normal at least until P0 and therefore allow normal pathfinding of efferents .
Most interestingly , there is no increase in radial fiber spacing in the apex , a specific problem of BDNF null mutants [ 6,13 ] .
However , there is one qualitative difference not recognized in any single neurotrophin null mutant .
Afferents reach all three rows of outer hair cells in the basal turn of control wildtype littermates ( Fig. 2c ) , but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 2d ) and does not show any clear <termsem="GO:0048532"> organization </term> into three distinct longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the three rows in the outer hair cell region .
These data suggest that fiber <termsem="GO:0048532"> organization </term> in the outer hair cell region is partly disrupted in Brn3c null mutant .
Brn3c null mutants at P7/8 .
Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced than at P0 .
Loss of afferents and , even more clearly of efferents , is most pronounced in the utricle ( Fig. 3a ,3 b ) and saccule ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , the innervation to the canal cristae , while reduced , has changed little from P0 .
In particular the horizontal canal receives a rather dense afferent and efferent innervation in Brn3c null mutants .
Reduction of innervation of the ear is shown in 8-day old mice .
While all vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia retain some afferent ( a ) and efferent ( b ) innervation , there is a more pronounced reduction , in particular of efferent fibers , to the utricle ( a , b ) as compared to the canals .
In the cochlea there is an increased spacing between radial fiber bundles in the basal turn ( c , e ) .
No afferents can be traced to the three outer spiral bundles along outer hair cells of mutant littermates ( c , e ) .
The apex shows little change , except for the absence of fibers to the area of outer hair cells and the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of inner spiral bundles passing along the few immature hair cells ( d , f , g ) .
The pattern obtained with DiI tracing is identical to that obtained by <termsem="GO:0006473"> acetylated </term> tubulin immunoreactivity ( f , g ) .
Bar indicates 1000 m in a , 100 m in b-g .
The cochlea at P8 shows more qualitative deviations from the normal pattern of innervation .
For example , all three rows of outer hair cells now receive both afferent and efferent innervation in the base of control littermates ( Fig. 3c ) .
However , no fibers extend to the outer hair cell region in Brn3c null mutants ( Figs. 3d ,3 e ,3 f ) .
In control animals there is dense innervation of inner hair cells , whereas Brn3c null mutants show a curious aggregation of fibers near focal spots around the habenula perforata .
The apex shows less pronounced deviations from normal ( Fig. 3f ,3 g ) .
However , as in the base , afferents and efferents extend sparingly to the outer hair cell region .
There is <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of an inner spiral bundle <termsem="GO:0007154"> communicating </term> both afferents and efferents between the focal points where fibers appear to pass through the habenula perforata ( Fig. 3f ,3 g ) .
As in newborn animals , efferent fibers closely follow the pattern of innervation displayed by afferents ( data not shown ) .
The limited qualitative effect of Brn3c null mutations on fiber loss is particularly obvious in the P8 Brn3c null mutant apical turn ( Fig. 3g ) .
Immunocytochemical and histochemcial data show the presence of only a few immature hair cells in the cochlea ( Fig. 4 ) , which amounted to about 1 % ( Table 1 ) .
Not a single immature hair cell <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> in the apex of the cochlea .
In contrast , more immature hair cells are found in the appropriate position of hair cells in the vestibular endorgans ( Table 1 ) .
In fact , the vestibular end organs show no overt morphological defect other than the reduced presence of these immature hair cells .
Nerve fibers can be traced into the <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelium of P0 and P8 Brn3c null mutants past the habenula perforata and there is a normal location of spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in Rosenthal 's canal in the apex of P8 Brn3c null mutants ( Fig. 3d ,3 g ) .
The cochlea shows other defects as well .
For example , the spiral capillary is not found underneath the organ of Corti but in the spiral limbus nearby ( Fig. 4 ) .
The lack of immature hair cells seems to affect also the formation of pillar cells ( undifferentiated almost throughout the cochlea ; Fig. 4 ) and Deiters ' cells ( not recognizable based on their morphology ) , a suggestion consistent with recent molecular data on the interaction of hair cells and supporting cells [ 17,18 ] .
The distribution of hair cells as identified with MyoVII immunocytochemistry is shown for 7-day old whole mounted cochlea ( a-d ) and the appearance of <termsem="GO:0030154"> cytological differentiation </term> is shown as revealed with epoxy resin sections in 7-day old ( e-g ) and 6-month old ( h ) control ( a , c , e ) and Brn3c mutant cochleae ( b,d,f-h ) .
Note the uniform staining with this antibody of all three rows of outer hair cells ( OHC ) and the single row of inner hair cells ( IHC ) in the wildtype ( a , c ) .
In contrast , only few immature hair cells ( iHC ) are found in the basal turn of the mutant littermate ( b ) and only an occasional cell is MyoVII immunopositive in the middle turn ( d ) .
No MyoVII positive immature hair cells exist in the apex .
Sections show the degree of differentiation of hair cells and their innervating fibers stained with tubulin immunocytochemistry ( arrow ; e-h ) .
Note the presence of a spiral capillary ( C ) under the tunnel of Corti separating the inner and outer hair cells in the P7 wildtype ( e ) .
In contrast , no such capillary is present underneath the organ of Corti in mutants ( f-h ) and no tunnel of Corti is found either .
A tectorial membrane <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> ( TM ) but otherwise there is little <termsem="GO:0030154"> cyotological differentiation </term> .
Note that tubulin-positive fibers can be traced to the immature cells until 6 months ( h ) .

Numbers of hair cells and <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in P7 wildtype and Brn3c mutant littermates .
Differences between wildtype and mutants are all highly significant .
Comparison of numbers of immature hair cells in the vestibular and cochlear areas ( Fig. 4 ) with the numbers of surviving vestibular and cochlear <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons does not show any correlation ( Table 1 ; Fig. 5 ) .
Only a few undifferentiated hair cells were detected by MyoVIIa immunostaining and only in the basal region of the cochlea .
And yet only about 50 % of cochlear <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the apex in which we could not detect any immature hair cells with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry .
This does not exclude the possibility that even less <termsem="GO:0035315"> differentiated </term> hair cells may <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in the apex .
This graph shows the reduction in <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons ( top ) and in hair cells ( bottom ) between 7-day old wildtype and Brn3c null mutant littermates .
Note the sharp reduction to 1 % in the cochlear immature hair cells ( bottom ) whereas spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons ( SG ) are only reduced by 50 % ( top ) .
In contrast , 20 % immature hair cells could be identified in vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia ( saccule has been selected ; bottom ) whereas only around 15 % of the vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons survive to this age ( VG ; top ) .
For details on the data see Table 1 .
The central projection of DiI and DiA traces fibers to the cochlear nuclei ( Fig. 6 ) where they show a clear segregation of apical turn afferents ( Fig. 6 , green ) and basal turn afferents ( Fig. 6 , red ) in both the entering cochlear nerve ( Fig. 6a ) and the ventral cochlear nucleus ( VCN ) ( Fig. 6b ) .
Qualitative comparable central projections are found in wildtype control littermates ( data not shown ) and suggest that the central projection to cochlear nuclei is at least until P8 in mice not critically dependent on <termsem="GO:0007605"> auditory </term> information or other hair cell-mediated influences , in agreement with recent suggestions [ 5,19 ] .
These confocal images show the projection pattern of a P8 Brn3c null mutant mouse .
DiI ( red ) was inserted into the basal turn , DiA ( green ) was inserted into the apical turn .
Note that the fibers run in discrete bundles inside the cochlear nerve ( a ) , spiral around each other near the root and project to distinct medial and lateral divisions of the ventral cochlear nucleus ( b ) .
These data suggest that a crude cochleotopic projection can <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> independently of any <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> from the immature hair cells of the cochlea .
Arrow indicates the efferent bundle as it leaves the afferent fiber tract .

6 months Brn3c null mutants .
Very few fibers ( both afferent and efferent ) to the vestibular epithelia remain ( Fig. 7a ) , thus displaying a further reduction of the pattern of innervation found in P8 Brn3c null mutants .
Notably , there are still a number of fibers extending from the very few vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons to the canal epithelia , in particular the horizontal canal ( Fig. 7a ,7 b ) .
Only very few fibers extend to the utricle and saccule with the reduction of efferents to these epithelia being almost complete ( Fig. 7a and data not shown ) .
Comparable to control mice , there is some transcellular labeling with DiI to cells apparently contacted by the afferent fibers in the Brn3c null mutant utricle ( Fig. 7b ) .
However , these cells could not be clearly identified as immature hair cells based on their morphology .
The innervation of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia is shown in 6-month old Brn3c null mutant mice .
Compared to P8 animals there is a further reduction of fiber density to vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia , but fibers can be traced to all <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia ( a , b ) .
Transcellular labeling with DiI ( b ) suggest contacts between these afferents and immature hair cells .
The cochlea shows a much reduced density of radial bundles , even in the apex ( c , d ) .
However , spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons are present in Rosenthal 's canal ( c , d ) and fibers extend to the organ of Corti where they <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> longitudinal tracts in the immature epithelium .
Bar indicates 100 m .
The cochlea , most prominently the apex , receives many afferent fibers , which <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> an interrupted inner spiral bundle ( Fig. 7c ) .
Some of the radial fiber bundles are <termsem="GO:0042552"> myelinated </term> ( Fig. 7d ) .
Only an occasional fiber extends beyond the inner spiral bundle into the area of the outer hair cells ( Fig. 7d ) .
Even at this late stage in <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> there are still numerous spiral neurons present in the apex ( Fig. 7c ,7 d ) .
In summary , these tracing data suggest that mature hair cells are not necessary to <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> fiber outgrowth and to maintain some fibers at least up to 6 months in the apex of the cochlea .
Importantly , the spatio-temporal loss of innervation does not follow the pattern of loss known from neurotrophin and <termsem="GO:0005030"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neurotrophin receptor </term> </term> null mutations as it starts in Brn3c mutant mice after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> confirms neonatal neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
We processed four ears of P0 and P8 Brn3c null and control littermates for <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BDNF and NT-3 using the riboprobes previously described [ 7 ] .
We did not analyze neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in 6-month old animals as neurotrophins are <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in neonates [ 20 ] and no <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> can be found even in normal animals [ 4 ] .
In the canal cristae we expected , and found , only a BDNF signal .
This signal was very strong over hair cells of the P0 control animals ( Fig. 8b ) .
In contrast , only a faint signal was detected in the Brn3c null mutant ( Fig. 8a ) and the few silver grains were located predominantly over the area of the immature hair cells .
The BDNF signal in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains appeared also in the Brn3c null mutants ( data not shown ) .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA is shown in the P0 vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia .
Silver grains are false colored as red to enhance visibility against the grey Nissl-stained background .
Canal cristae contain only BDNF ( a , b ) , but gravistatic endorgans , such as saccule and utricle , contain both BDNF and NT-3 ( c-f ) .
Note the prominent BDNF <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the hair cell region ( HaC ) of control canal ( b ) and saccule ( d ) and low levels of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the Brn3c null mice ( a , c ) over immature hair cells ( iHC ) .
The NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is much more diffuse in both control and Brn3c mutant littermates .
Bar indicates 100 m .
In the saccule , we directly compared the BDNF ( Fig. 8c ,8 d ) and NT-3 signal ( Fig. 8e ,8 f ) of the Brn3c null mutant ( Fig. 8c ,8 e ) and control littermates ( Fig. 8d ,8 f ) .
A strong BDNF signal was found over the hair cells of control animals and an occasional immature hair cell also showed a BDNF signal in the Brn3c null mutants .
The NT-3 signal was more diffuse in both the control and the Brn3c null littermates but showed some slightly above background signal in the area of the <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelium even in the Brn3c null mutant .
In the cochlea , the BDNF signal was very weak in the base in both the control ( Fig. 9b ) and the Brn3c null littermates ( Fig. 9a ) .
However , there was a surprisingly strong NT-3 signal over the organ of Corti in the apex of Brn3c null littermates ( Fig. 9c ) that closely matched the signal found in the control littermates ( Fig. 9d ) .
The NT-3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC 's persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice ( Fig. 9e ,9 f ) .
BDNF and NT-3 mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is shown in the cochlea of P0 ( a-d ) and P8 ( e , f ) Brn3c null and control littermates .
Note the limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BDNF in the basal turn of both wildtype and mutant littermates ( a , b ) and the much stronger <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of NT-3 in the apex over the region of the inner hair cells in both wildtype and control littermates ( c , d ) .
NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> persists at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice in an area that topologically compares to the inner hair cells of control animals ( e , f , arrows ) .

We will explore five points in this discussion : How the limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of neurotrophins relates to the apparent survival of primary neurons until P8 ; how the known absence of apical hair cells and of classical neurotrophins can be related to the presence of large numbers of apical turn spiral neurons ; how absence of <termsem="GO:0035315"> differentiated </term> hair cells affects afferent and efferent <termsem="GO:0008039"> targeting </term> ; and how these data possibly relate to other mutant animals and to children <termsem="GO:0007567"> born </term> with profound <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> loss .
Immature hair cells and limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of neurotrophins rescue afferent projection until P8 .
The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the mediators for target mediated <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> .
In essence , this theory of <termsem="GO:0050789"> regulation </term> of neuronal connections via <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are <termsem="GO:0046903"> released </term> by the target tissue to support only properly connected <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins [ 21 ] .
Past experiments , which eliminated one or more neurotrophins entirely , only partially tested the basic assumption of this theory in vivo .
For example , in BDNF heterozygotic animals there is a small decrease in the number of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in the ear [ 13 ] but no change in the overall pattern of innervation .
Moreover , all of the neurotrophin / <termsem="GO:0005030"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neurotrophin receptor </term> </term> null mutants studied to date eliminate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in both the peripheral target and the brain simultaneously and achieve their effects in late embryos .
In contrast , Brn3c is barely <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> in the CNS [ 22 ] thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons depends crucially on the periphery .
We suggest that limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice .
In agreement with this suggestion , our in situ data show a severe reduction in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BDNF ( Figs. 8 , 9 ) .
Despite this reduction , some , apparently biologically significant low levels of neurotrophins are apparently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in all <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia in embryonic Brn3c null mutants .
It appears that even these low levels of neurotrophins in the vestibular <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia can sustain normal fiber outgrowth and a limited maintenance until P0 .
The comparatively high level of NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Brn3c null mutant cochlea , which has been shown to be the neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons [ 6,9,14 ] , is in agreement with the normal <termsem="GO:0021562"> development of cochlear innervation </term> in newborn Brn3c null mutants .
Since BDNF appears to be exclusively <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> by hair cells [ 6,7,20 ] , the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BDNF , as is the case in the canal cristae ( Fig. 8 ) .
Past research has shown that in BDNF and trkB null mutants this innervation to canal cristae is lost before <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> [ 6,13 ] .
That even these low levels of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> are significant is clear from the fact that all canal <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia receive an innervation by both afferents and efferents at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and later ( Figs. 2 , 3 ) .
The situation in the utricle , saccule and cochlea is less clear as both BDNF and NT-3 are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> [ 6,7 ] .
In fact , it appears that the levels of NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> hardly differ from those in control littermates ( Figs. 8 , 9 ) .
The latter is particularly obvious in the apex of the cochlea .
In fact , in the cochlea of embryos and neonates as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos , NT-3 is predominantly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in supporting cells [ 6 ] .
This <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of NT-3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons in the apex of 8-day old animals ( Figs. 3 , 4 ) .
Long term survival of apical <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons is unrelated to <termsem="GO:0035315"> differentiated </term> hair cells and likely is independent of neurotrophins .
Past work has shown that BDNF and NT-3 appear to shift in their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> into inner hair cells around <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> or are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system [ 6,10,20,23 ] .
It has been suggested that other neurotrophins may come into play in the ear [ 11 ] .
However , the apex of Brn3c null mutants , which retains most of the spiral neuron afferents at 6-month , shows no formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here ( P0 , P8 , P10 ) .
Thus the factor ( s ) can not be <termsem="GO:0046903"> released </term> by <termsem="GO:0035315"> differentiated </term> hair cells but there is an unexplored possibility of generalized <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of neurotrophins at low levels in the undifferentiated epithelia .
However , known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult cochleae [ 4 ] and significant amounts of neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appear to develop only in postnatal animals in the CNS [ 24 ] .
Such <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the CNS could possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of neutrophins in targeted null mutants .
This would work only in cases in which the loss of primary neurons would not already be completed long before <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> as is the case in the ear [ 6,13 ] .
It therefore remains unclear what supports the many afferents in the apex of the Brn3c null mutants until 6 months of age or longer , unknown peripheral <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> substances or <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support provided by the CNS .
Comparable long term retention of apical spiral <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons was described for the deaf white cat [ 25 ] and may also be the case in humans with congenital deafness .
<termsem="GO:0040007"> Growth </term> of fibers to the cochlea does not require mature hair cells .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Formation </term> of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal , even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa .
This does not preclude that even less <termsem="GO:0035315"> differentiated </term> hair cell precursors may <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in the apex or that those precursors have <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> before <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Interestingly , the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> to outer hair cells is most affected in Brn3c null mutant cochleae .
Instead of extending radially through the tunnel of Corti to outer hair cells , afferents appear to stall and extend in longitudinal directions as inner spiral bundles ( Figs. 3 , 7 ) .
It has been shown that the differentiation of pillar cells depends on activation of Fgfr3 [ 26 ] by FGF 's , probably Fgf8 , a factor <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> by <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> and mature inner hair cells [ 18,27 ] .
The formation of supporting cells also appears to depend on the proper <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of various bHLH factors such as Hes 1 and 5 which appear to be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by the <termsem="GO:0007219"> Notch signaling pathway </term> [ 17,28,29 ] .
It is possible that the apparent inability of fibers to extend along outer hair cells is related to the lack of differentiation of supporting cells in the absence of mature hair cells .
Probing for the proper <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of supporting cell specific markers in Brn3c null mutants is necessary to further evaluate these suggestions .
Previous work has suggested that efferent fibers , derived from facial branchial motoneurons , follow afferents and for that reason reflect in detail all connectional deviations of afferents [ 16,30-32 ] .
Our data agree with this scenario but extend it .
Specifically , efferent fibers may suffer the same loss of their molecularly unknown <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support as do afferents and therefore show the same spatio-temporal profile of loss ( Fig. 3 ) .
Alternatively , efferent fibers can sustain <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> connections only as long as afferent fibers are present .
More information on the actual molecular support of efferent fibers in the ear is needed before those two possibilities can be distinguished .
The onset of cochleotopic projections has been investigated in detail in only very few mammals [ 19 ] .
These data suggest that a cochleotopic projection <termsem="GO:0032502"> develops </term> before onset of <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> .
Our data show that at least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and the cochlear nuclei <termsem="GO:0032502"> develops </term> even in Brn 3c null mutants ( Fig. 6 ) .
Those data are also consistent with the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of a crude cochleotopic projection in NT-3 null mutants [ 6,14 ] .
Those mutants have a much more severely reduced density of innervation in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> cochlea [ 6,14 ] than the reduction we found in Brn3c null mutants at P0 .
In this context , it would be interesting to see whether the recently <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> transgenic mouse in which BDNF is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> under NT-3 promoter <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> [ 33 ] could actually perform an even more pronounced rescue in a Brn3c null mutant background .
Relevance of our findings to other mutations with hair cell loss .
Vahava et al. [ 12 ] and Frydman et al. [ 34 ] have demonstrated that mutation in a single human allele of Pou4f3 ( Brn3c ) results in a late onset of high frequency <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> loss .
Thus far no data are available that correlate the late onset of <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> loss with morphological defects in the cochlea .
In fact , an investigation of Brn3c heterozygotic mice showed no additional effect on <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> loss due to haploinsufficiency in these mice [ 35 ] .
Our data on Brn3c null mouse mutants nevertheless suggest that the high to low frequency progressive <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> loss in humans may correlate with the unknown factor ( s ) that mediate apical spiral neuron survival into adulthood .
Quantitative data on human Pou4f3 cochleae is needed to verify that spiral neuron loss is more pronounced in the basal , high frequency area of these <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> - deficient patients .
Similar data are also needed for other congenitally deaf children [ 36 ] and in the deaf white cat [ 25 ] .
Further work on the recently available mutant mice with specific absence of all hair cells [ 37 ] , outer hair cells in the base [ 38 ] or apex [ 39 ] could further help to clarify the role of hair cells in <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> and maintaining afferent and efferent innervation in these model mice .
The progressive loss of afferent and efferent innervation in Brn3c null mutants shows neither in spatial nor in temporal pattern a resemblance to losses reported in simple BDNF or NT-3 null mutations [ 6 ] .
Null mutants of ear specific neurotrophins have completed the loss of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons before <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
In contrast , our results suggest a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation between P0 and at least 6 months .
This late <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neuron loss is likely not related to known neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> which becomes reduced in neonatal wildtype animals .
Other factors , such as GDNF [ 11,40 ] need to be investigated in their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in these mutants and their functional role needs to be assessed , in particular in the cochlear apex .
The long term retention of afferents in the cochlear apex in the absence of any apparent differentiation of hair cells raises hopes for cochlear implants in deaf - <termsem="GO:0007567"> born </term> children .
Similar long term retention of apical afferents exists in the deaf white cat [ 25 ] and should be explored in other model systems with embryonic and neonatal hair cell loss [ 37,38 ] .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> <termsem="GO:0007618"> Breeding </term> </term> and genotyping .
Brn3c mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> </term> as previously described [ 22 ] .
Mice were genotyped and Brn3c null mutants were raised to a specific age ( P0 , N = 8 ; P7 , N = 6 ; P8 , N = 6 ; 6 months old , N = 2 ) .
The animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) .
Ears were postfixed in the same fixative for at least one day prior to dissection .
Tracing of nerve fibers .
DiI tracing from the brainstem was performed as previously described [ 41 ] .
Small filter stripes soaked with saturated DiI were implanted into the efferent fiber bundle near the floor plate or into the ascending or descending afferents in the alar plate [ 42 ] .
After appropriate diffusion time of the dye , the ears were dissected and mounted flat for visualization in an epifluorescent microscope .
Images were taken on black and white film or acquired with a cooled CCD camera and processed using ImagePro software ( Media Cybernetics ) .
Ears were subsequently reacted for <termsem="GO:0006473"> acetylated </term> tubulin to reveal the pattern of innervation in addition to the DiI tracing with a different technique as previously described [ 14 ] .
Briefly , dissected ears were incubated with 1:500 anti- <termsem="GO:0006473"> acetylated </term> tubulin antibodies ( Sigma , St. Louis ) followed by secondary antibodies <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> to HRP .
Dissected inner ears were reacted with DAB and H2O2 for HRP <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> and subsequently viewed as whole mounts .
After photographing as whole mounts , the ears were embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned to reveal the distribution of fibers inside the <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelia in more detail .
Cochleotopic projection was evaluated by inserting DiI soaked filter strips into the base and DiA soaked filter strips into the apical turn of 2 P0 and 4 P8 Brn3c null mutants and a similar number of wildtype littermates .
After appropriate diffusion time [ 43 ] , the brains with the attached cochlear nerve were embedded in gelatin , hardened in 4 % PFA over night , sectioned coronally on a vibratome ( 100 m thickness ) and viewed with a Biorad Radiance 2000 confocal system attached to a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope .
Image stacks were collapsed to view the entire projection in one section in one focal plane .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
Four ears each of Brn3c null mutants ( P0 and P8 ) and control littermates were embedded in paraffin , sectioned and probed for the presence of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA using the in situ technique previously described [ 7 ] .
Sections were lightly counterstained and viewed with bright and dark field microscopy .
Images were acquired with a CCD camera and displayed as false color images as previously described [ 18 ] .
Immunocytochemistry of hair cells and quantification of hair cells and neurons .
Immunostaining of P7 cochlear whole mounts using the hair cell specific-myosin VII ( MyoVIIa ) antibody was performed as previously described [ 2 ] .
Images of labeled organs of Corti were then acquired using a SPOT digital camera ( Diagnostic Instruments Inc. ) and the number of hair cells was scored from acquired images .
To determine the number of hair cells or neurons in vestibular endorgans or <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> ganglia , serial sections were stained with Cresyl Violet and images were similarly acquired and scored .
Every other section was scored for each <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> epithelium and every forth section was scored for each ganglion .
Only neurons or cells with a clear nucleus and nucleoli were counted and 4 -- 6 samples were counted for each epithelium and ganglion .
All data were tested for significance using two-sample Student 's t-test with unequal variances .
MX generated the null mutation , <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> all the mice used for this study and generated the statistical data and the immunocytochemical data with MyoVII , AM conducted the tract tracing studies of cochlear afferents and helped with the histological analysis and assembly of image plates , UP carried out the in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> for neurotrophins and assembled the plates for these data , BF wrote the manuscript , carried out most of the neuronal tracing and immunocytochemistry for <termsem="GO:0006473"> acetylated </term> tubulin and data presentation .
