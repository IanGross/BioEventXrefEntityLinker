A mouse model of sitosterolemia : absence of Abcg8/sterolin -2 results in failure to secrete biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> .
Mutations in either of two genes comprising the STSL locus , <termsem="CHEBI:15422"> <termsem="CHEBI:30616"> ATP </term> </term> - binding cassette ( ABC ) - transporters ABCG5 ( encoding sterolin-1 ) and ABCG8 ( encoding sterolin-2 ) , result in sitosterolemia , a rare autosomal recessive disorder of <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> trafficking characterized by increased plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels .
Based upon the genetics of sitosterolemia , ABCG5/sterolin -1 and ABCG8/sterolin -2 are hypothesized to function as obligate heterodimers .
No phenotypic difference has yet been described in humans with complete defects in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 .
These <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , based upon the defects in humans , are responsible for regulating dietary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> entry and biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion .
In order to mimic the human disease , we created , by a targeted disruption , a mouse model of sitosterolemia resulting in Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficiency alone .
Homozygous knockout mice are viable and exhibit sitosterolemia .
Mice deficient in Abcg8 have significantly increased plasma and tissue <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels ( <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> ) consistent with sitosterolemia .
Interestingly , Abcg5/sterolin -1 was expressed in both liver and intestine in Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice and continued to show an apical expression .
Remarkably , Abcg8 deficient mice had an impaired ability to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> into bile , but still maintained the ability to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> .
We also report an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygous Abcg8 + / - mice that are not sitosterolemic , but have a decreased level of biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion relative to wild-type mice .
These data indicate that Abcg8/sterolin -2 is necessary for biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion and that loss of Abcg8/sterolin -2 has a more profound effect upon biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion than <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> .
Since biliary <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> secretion is preserved , although not elevated in the sitosterolemic mice , this observation suggests that mechanisms other than by Abcg8/sterolin -2 may be responsible for its secretion into bile .
Absorption of dietary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> from the intestine is an important part of <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> homeostasis and represents the initial step that allows dietary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> to exert its metabolic effects .
A typical western diet contains relatively equal amounts of <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> and non - <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> , mainly <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> , of which about 55 % of the dietary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> is absorbed and retained compared to ~ 1 % of the dietary non - <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> [ 1-3 ] .
Schoenheimer recognized more than 75 years ago that only <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> , not non - <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> , is absorbed in the intestine , although the exact <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> molecular </term> mechanisms by which preferential <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> absorption occurs has not been fully elucidated [ 4 ] .
Similarly , although the liver secretes free <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> into bile , it can preferentially excrete non - <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> into bile and the mechanism ( s ) of this process has yet to be elucidated as well .
Only recently , through the study of a rare human disease , have clues to this process been revealed .
Sitosterolemia ( MIM 210250 , also known as phytosterolemia ) is a rare autosomal , recessively inherited disorder characterized by elevated blood and tissue <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels [ 5 ] .
Affected individuals can develop tendon and/or tuberous xanthomas , hemolytic episodes , arthralgias , arthritis , and premature atherosclerosis [ 6,7 ] .
Sitosterolemic patients have diagnostically elevated plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels ( for example , <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> , stigmasterol , and avenosterol , etc. ) and their 5-saturated stanol metabolites , particularly sitostanol , with normal or only moderately increased <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> levels .
Clinical studies have shown that affected individuals hyperabsorb all dietary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> ( thus have lost the ability to restrict the <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> species absorbed ) and have lost the ability to excrete <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> into bile [ 8,9 ] .
Infusion of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> into normal individuals leads to a rapid and preferential excretion of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> into bile , but in sitosterolemic individuals biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion is almost absent [ 7,9 ] .
Previous studies on sitosterolemia have suggested a defect involving a putative <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> ` transporter ' expressed in the intestinal brush border and/or the hepatic canalicular membrane [ 10,11 ] .
Genetic analyses of sitosterolemia pedigrees allowed the mapping of the STSL locus to human chromosome 2p21 , between D2S2294 and D2S2298 [ 12,13 ] .
By using positional cloning procedures or by screening for genes induced by exposure to LXR <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonists </term> , two groups identified not one but two genes , ABCG5 and ABCG8 , which encode the <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 , mutations of which cause sitosterolemia [ 14-16 ] .
Interestingly , complete mutation in either ABCG5 alone or ABCG8 alone is not only necessary , but sufficient to cause the disease [ 14 ] .
To date , no patient with sitosterolemia has been identified with mutations in both genes .
Based upon these data , and the similarity of the clinical and biochemical phenotype , sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 are hypothesized to function as obligate heterodimers .
This is also supported by the fact that each of these <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> is a ` half-transporter ' , containing six transmembrane domains , and not the classical 12 transmembrane characteristic of functional ABC transporters .
The exact function of these two <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> still remains unknown but recent studies have shown that overexpression of ABCG5/ABCG8 in a transgenic mouse model results in an increased biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> concentration and a 50 % reduction in the fractional absorption of dietary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> [ 17 ] .
It has been suggested that ABCG5 and ABCG8 act as mutual chaperones for both maturation and correct apical targeting .
Co-expression of both was required for apical trafficking in a polarized cell line , as well in vivo using Abcg5/Abcg8 double-knockout mice [ 18,19 ] .
However , no functional assay has yet been developed to demonstrate whether or not the two half-transporters function as homo - or heterodimers and whether they selectively pump <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> .
Likewise , the cellular localization of these two <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> has yet to be shown in a model deficient in either Abcg5 or Abcg8 alone .
A mouse model disrupting both Abcg5 and Abcg8 simultaneously results in a phenotype similar to that of the human disease [ 20 ] .
However , it is important to point out that the human disease is caused by complete mutation in one or the other gene , but not both simultaneously .
We hypothesized that disruption of only one of the half-transporters would result in sitosterolemia and selective loss of either sterolin may show a differential effect on the biliary secretion of <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> or intestinal absorption of <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> .
These studies are difficult to test in humans , as the target organs are relatively inaccessible .
In order to test this hypothesis , we report a mouse model that has a selective genetic mutation of Abcg8 .
Mice homozygous for Abcg8 loss exhibit many of the characteristics of the human disease sitosterolemia .
In addition , we report studies of biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion that show that despite forced secretion , Abcg8-deficient animals can not secrete <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> into bile , although <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> secretion seemed unaffected .
Targeting vector construction and generation of knockout mice .
A mouse genomic bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) library ( CitbCJ7 , ES cell line/129Sv , Research Genetics , Inc. , Huntsville , AL , USA ) was screened by using primers designed from the sequences of mouse Abcg5 and Abcg8 cDNA as previously reported [ 21 ] .
A positive BAC clone was used as a template to amplify genomic DNA fragments of Abcg8 .
Long-fragment polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was performed using Expanded Long Template PCR system kit ( Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IA , USA ) .
An approximately 4.5 kb ` long-arm ' genomic fragment containing partial exon 1 to partial exon 3 was inserted into the Pml I restriction-cloning site A of OSDUPDEL vector .
The ` short-arm ' genomic fragment , containing partial exon 4 to partial exon 6 , was cloned into the Not I-Kpn I of cloning site B. Homologous targeting would result in complete intron 3 , partial exon 3 and partial exon 4 replacement by the <termsem="CHEBI:44577"> neomycin </term> - resistance cassette , resulting in the disruption of the ABC Walker A motif ( Figure 1a ) .
ES cells ( 129/SvEvTac-cell line ) were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector DNA and cultured on sub-confluent embryonic fibroblasts .
Transfected cell colonies were selected by culturing cells in medium containing 200 g/mL G418 ( Life Technologies , Rockville , MD , USA ) .
The ES cells were screened for homologous recombination by PCR with the forward primer , neoF ( 5 ' - GGGTCGTTTGTTCGGATCAA-3 ' ) from neo cassette , and reverse primer intron 6R ( 5 ' - ACCAGTTGGTCCTAGCTCGA-3 ' ) , which is located outside the targeting construct in mouse Abcg8 intron 6 .
Positively targeted ES cell clones were confirmed by Southern blotting , using ES cell DNA digested by BamHI and a probe comprising of a 562 bp PCR fragment from partial intron 2 and exon 3 of Abcg8 gene .
Positively targeted ES cells were microinjected into C57BL6 blastocysts and transplanted into pseudopregnant recipients .
Five highly chimeric mice ( agouti coat color , three males and two females ) were isolated and bred with C57BL/6J mice to generate germ-line transmission heterozygous mice of Abcg8 gene disruption .
Heterozygous offspring mice were back-crossed to C57BL/6J mice ( n > 5 ) to produce disrupted line and inter-crossed to generate knockout mice .
All mice were maintained on a standard rodent <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> ( Harlan Teklad mouse/rat diet LM-485 ) which contained 61 mg/kg <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> , 31 mg/kg <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> , and 105 mg/kg <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> , given free access to <termsem="CHEBI:15377"> water </term> and maintained at 25 C with a 12-h light , 12-h dark cycle .
All animals were housed in the facilities for laboratory animals provided by the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources ACLAM .
The Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at Medical University of South Carolina approved all experiments .
Mouse tail DNA was isolated and purified by cutting approximately 0.5 cm of mouse tail and digesting it in 500 l lysis buffer ( 50 mM <termsem="CHEBI:9754"> Tris </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:17883"> <termsem="CHEBI:36807"> HCl </term> </term> , pH8 .0 , 100 mM <termsem="CHEBI:30378"> <termsem="CHEBI:42191"> EDTA </term> </term> , 125 mM <termsem="CHEBI:26710"> NaCl </term> , 1 % <termsem="CHEBI:8984"> SDS </term> , 200 g Proteinase K ) with rocking overnight at 55 C .
200 l saturated <termsem="CHEBI:26710"> NaCl </term> was added into digested solution with vigorous shaking for at least 60 seconds .
Mixed solution was spun down at maximum speed in top micro-centrifuge for 20 min .
The supernatant was transferred to a new tube with equal volume 100 % <termsem="CHEBI:16236"> EtOH </term> and mixed by inversion .
The DNA pellet was washed in 70 % <termsem="CHEBI:16236"> EtOH </term> and resuspended in 100 -- 150 l TE buffer .
UV spectrophotometry and electrophoresis were used to analyze the quality and quantity of the genomic DNA .
Genotyping was performed by multiplex PCR reaction using three separate primers ( two Abcg8 gene specific primers , mg8-in3F 5 ' - CCCAATGATGAATGAGACGCT-3 ' , mg8-R9 5 ' - TTTGTCACGCTGGGCCTGG-3 ' and neoF for identification of Abcg8 target status ) .
The PCR reaction consisted of 1x PCR buffer ( 1.5 mM <termsem="CHEBI:6636"> MgCl2 </term> , 16 mM ( <termsem="CHEBI:28938"> NH4 </term> ) 2SO4 , 0.1 mM <termsem="CHEBI:16381"> dNTPs </term> , 67 mM <termsem="CHEBI:9754"> Tris </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:17883"> <termsem="CHEBI:36807"> HCl </term> </term> ( pH8 .8 ) ) 1 M of each primer , <termsem="CHEBI:15377"> water </term> and 1.0 units of Taq polymerase .
The reactions were cycled as follows : 94 C for 30 sec , 60 C for 30 sec , 72 C for 1 min for 35 cycles .
The PCR products were identified by electrophoresis .
To confirm PCR results , DNAs were digested with Bam HI , subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.6 % <termsem="CHEBI:2511"> agarose </term> gel and transferred to <termsem="CHEBI:25614"> nylon </term> membrane .
Southern blot filters were hybridized with a 562 bp PCR fragment from partial intron 2 and exon 3 of Abcg8 <termsem="CHEBI:37972"> 32P </term> - randomly-labeled probe as previously described [ 22 ] .
Isolation of liver and intestinal total RNA from Abcg8 + / + , Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice and Northern blot analyses were performed as previously described [ 23 ] .
The probe for Abcg5 was 1964 bp ( <termsem="CHEBI:25613"> nt </term> 136 -- 2099 , GeneBank  accession no .
AH011511 ) and the probe for Abcg8 was 2019 bp ( <termsem="CHEBI:25613"> nt </term> 103 -- 2126 , GeneBank  accession no .
AH011518 ) .
To confirm that there was no alternative splicing of the disrupted allele , RT-PCR was performed on cDNAs of pooled mouse liver .
Briefly , samples of total RNA ( 0.5 g ) from pooled mouse livers ( n = 4 ) were reverse transcribed according to the SuperScript  First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) using random hexamers in a final total reaction volume of 20 l .
RT-PCR was performed using primers located outside of the targeted region : F1 ( CCTCAGCTGGTGAGGAGGTG ) with R1 ( GATGGAGAAGGTGAAGTTGCC ) , F2 ( ATTTCCAATGACTTCCGGGAC ) with R1 and F3 ( CTGGAAGACGGGCTGTACACT ) with R1 , to produce expected product lengths of 1449 , 654 and 429 bp respectively in wild-type cDNA .
Primers were based upon previously published primer sets [ 24-26 ] or designed using MacVector , which were designed from either <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> or cDNA to avoid the amplification of potentially contaminating genomic DNA in the total RNA sample ( Table 1 ) .
Samples of total RNA ( 0.5 g ) from pooled mouse livers ( n = 4 ) were reverse transcribed according to the SuperScript  First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) using random hexamers with a final total reaction volume of 20 l .
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a PE Biosystems GeneAmp  5700 sequence Detection System ( Forest City , CA , USA ) .
Standard reaction volume was 10 l containing 1  QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) , 0.002 U AmpErase UNG enzyme ( PE Biosystems , Forest City , CA , USA ) , 0.7 l of cDNA template from reverse transcription reaction as above and 100 -- 500 nM of oligonucleotide primers .
Initial steps of RT-PCR were two minutes at 50 C for UNG activation , followed by a 15 minute hold at 95 C .
Cycles ( n = 40 ) consisted of a 15 second melt at 95 C , followed by a 1 minute annealing/extension at 60 C .
The final step was a 60 C incubation for 1 minute .
At the end of the run , samples were heated to 95 C with a ramp time of 20 minutes to construct dissociation curves to ensure that single PCR products were obtained .
All reactions were performed in triplicate .
Threshold cycle ( CT ) analysis of all samples was set at 0.5 relative fluorescence units .
The relative quantities of message of genes of interest from the mouse liver samples used in real-time RT-PCR were normalized to cyclophilin to compensate for variations in input RNA amounts .
The data were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle method ( CT ) .
Briefly , the CT values are averaged , from the triplicates defining a -CT value calculated by taking the average CT of the gene of interest and subtracting it from the average CT of cyclophilin .
The -CT was calculated by subtracting the average -CT ( calibrator ) values from the -CT ( sample ) .
The relative quantification was then calculated by the expression 2-Average-CT .
The <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> quantity for the calibrator ( wild type ) was expressed as 1 and all other quantities were expressed as a fold difference relative to the calibrator ( wild type ) .
Plasma <termsem="CHEBI:18059"> lipid </term> analysis by fast <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> liquid chromatography .
Following 16 hrs of fasting , blood samples ( n = 3 ) from each of the Abcg8 + / + , Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice were collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus using heparinized capillary tubes under isoflurane anesthesia , and placed into precooled tubes containing 10 l of 0.5 M <termsem="CHEBI:30378"> <termsem="CHEBI:42191"> EDTA </term> </term> .
Equal volumes of plasma from each genotype were pooled and 100 L of the pooled sample were injected and fractionated by fast <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> liquid chromatography ( FPLC ) using a Superose 6 HR10/30 column ( Pharmacia Biotech Inc. , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) and analyzed as described [ 27 ] .
<termsem="CHEBI:15889"> Sterol </term> composition of plasma and tissues .
Following a four-hour fast of 12-week-old mice fed on regular rodent <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> diet ; blood and tissues were collected under isofluorane anesthesia from each of the Abcg8 + / + , Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice ( n = 3 for each group ) .
Blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus by heparinized glass tube .
The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation for tissue collection .
Plasma ( 100 l ) was saponified in 1 N <termsem="CHEBI:32145"> NaOH </term> for one hour , 1.5 mL <termsem="CHEBI:15377"> water </term> added and <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> extracted with three sequential portions of 1.5 mL <termsem="CHEBI:27750"> <termsem="CHEBI:37807"> <termsem="CHEBI:42266"> ethyl </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:30089"> <termsem="CHEBI:40574"> acetate </term> </term> </term> , containing 70 g <termsem="CHEBI:35515"> 5-cholestane </term> as an internal standard , pooled and dried .
Mouse tissues ( liver , spleen and brain ) were weighed , homogenized in 1 mL <termsem="CHEBI:26020"> <termsem="CHEBI:35780"> phosphate </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:35225"> buffer </term> saline ( PBS ) with a dounce homogenizer ( 15 strokes at 500 rpm ) and a small aliquot of the whole homogenate assayed for <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> concentration .
Aliquots for <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> analysis from whole tissue homogenates were extracted as described above .
Dried <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> samples were derivatized as trimethylsilylethers , redissolved in 10 L <termsem="CHEBI:29021"> hexane </term> and 2 L samples were injected into a capillary column ( 26 m length , 0.32 mm ID , 0.45 mm OD ) coated with liquid CpWAX 57 CB ( Chrompak , Bridgewater , NJ , USA ) in a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector [ 28 ] .
Concentrations of plasma and tissue <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> were reported as mg/dL and g/g wet weight tissue , respectively .
Three separate polyclonal anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 antibodies have been raised as previously described [ 20,29,30 ] .
In experiments , anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 antibodies are labelled as follows : 1 ) SC -- from the Patel group , 2 ) AMC -- from the AMC Liver Center group , and 3 ) UTSW -- from the Hobbs group .
Membrane <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> preparations .
Total membranes were prepared by taking approximately 500 mg of liver tissue cut into small pieces and homogenized in ice cold lysis buffer ( 5 mM <termsem="CHEBI:9754"> Tris </term> - pH7 .5 , 250 mM <termsem="CHEBI:17992"> sucrose </term> with <termsem="CHEBI:37670"> protease inhibitors </term> ) by a dounce homogenizer times 10 strokes .
Samples were then subjected to centrifugation -- 1300 g for 10 minutes at 4 C .
The supernant was saved and the pellet was resuspended and again subjected to dounce homogenization times 10 strokes then centrifuged 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C .
This step was repeated twice each time with the supernant being collected and kept on ice .
The supernants were then pooled and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 60 minutes at 4 C .
The supernant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer .
Plasma membranes were prepared as previously described [ 31 ] .
<termsem="CHEBI:36080"> Protein </term> sample concentrations were then determined by Bio-Rad <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> colormetric assay per manufacturer 's protocol ( BioRad , Hercules , CA , USA ) .
50 g of membrane <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> were then resolved on 7.5 % <termsem="CHEBI:8984"> SDS </term> <termsem="CHEBI:28619"> acrylamide </term> gel .
<termsem="CHEBI:36080"> Proteins </term> resolved by <termsem="CHEBI:8984"> SDS </term> - PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes .
Membranes were then blocked for one hour in 5 % dry milk in PBS-T ( <termsem="CHEBI:26020"> <termsem="CHEBI:35780"> Phosphate </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:35225"> Buffered </term> saline and 0.1 % Tween 20 ) .
Blots were then probed with primary antibody against Abcg5 in 5 % milk in PBS-T overnight at 4 C .
The blot was then washed three times for five minutes in TBS-T ( <termsem="CHEBI:9754"> Tris </term> <termsem="CHEBI:35225"> Buffered </term> Saline/0 .1 % Tween-20 ) with 150 mM <termsem="CHEBI:26710"> NaCl </term> , and secondarily stained with goat-anti-rabbit conjugated HRP 1:10,000 dilution in 5 % milk in PBS-T for one hour .
The blot was again washed three times for five minutes in TBS-T with 150 mM <termsem="CHEBI:26710"> NaCl </term> then covered in Western Lightning  Chemiluminescence <termsem="CHEBI:33893"> Reagent </term> Plus ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences , Inc. .
Boston , MA , USA ) , wrapped in plastic , exposed to film and developed .
Snap-frozen liver and intestine tissue were cut to produce 8 m thick frozen sections , air-dried for 30 minutes onto glass slides and stored at -80 C until required .
The slides were stained with hematoxylin , rinsed three times with PBS , fixed for 10 min with cooled <termsem="CHEBI:17790"> methanol </term> at -20 C and then rinsed three times with PBS .
Slides for antibody staining were initially blocked in PBS/0 .1 M <termsem="CHEBI:15428"> glycine </term> / 10 % goat serum for 60 min at room temperature then incubated with anti-sterolin-1 antibody ( 1:15 dilution ) overnight at 4 C .
The slides were washed with 1  PBS and incubated with secondary antibody ( goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with rhodamine , 1:1000 dilution ) for 30 min at room temperature , washed and then observed under an Olympus BX-5 confocal microscope with Fluoview .
The sections stained at the AMC Liver Center were fixed in 100 % <termsem="CHEBI:15347"> acetone </term> for 30 min at room temperature , blocked in a solution of PBS/0 .05 % Tween-20 / 5 % goat serum ( GS ) for one hour , then incubated with Anti-sterolin-1 ( 1:40 dilution ) and anti-Bsep ( 1:200 dilution ) diluted in PBS/Tween/GS , for one hour .
Thereafter , slides were washed 3  10 min in PBS/Tween and the secondary antibody ( goat-anti-rabbit Alexa 488 ) was applied in 1:1000 dilution in PBST/GS for one hour at room temperature .
After washing for 3  10 min the sections were mounted in Dapi/Dapco solution .
Fluorescence microscopy was done with a Leica DM RA2 microscope equipped with a Leica DC350F photo camera .
For Dapi staining , 359 nm ( 30.38 ms exposure ) was used and for Abcg5 and Bsep staining , 514 nm ( for both : 1654.34 ms exposure ) was used and the pictures were analyzed and overlaid using FW4000 software ( Leica ) .
Transfection and immunostaining of COS-1 cells .
COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-mouse Abcg5 and pCMV-mouse Abcg8 expression constructs using the Qiagen SuperFect reagent per protocol ( Valencia , CA , USA ) .
Briefly , COS-1 cells were seeded onto a six-well plate the day prior to transfection to generate 60 % confluence when grown at 37 C and 5 % <termsem="CHEBI:16526"> CO2 </term> in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 U/ml <termsem="CHEBI:17334"> penicillin </term> , 100 g/ml <termsem="CHEBI:17076"> streptomycin </term> and 1  <termsem="CHEBI:28300"> glutamine </term> .
On the day of transfection , 2 g of DNA was mixed with Qiagen SuperFect reagent and incubated for 10 minutes .
This mixture was then added to serum-free media and placed on the cells to incubate for two hours .
The cells were washed once with 1x PBS and fresh media was added .

Bile sampling started directly after cannulation and was collected for 10 min .
Bile flow was determined gravimetrically .
Biliary <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipid </term> concentrations were determined as described previously [ 32 ] .
To determine maximal secretion rates of biliary <termsem="CHEBI:18059"> lipid </term> secretion , bile was diverted for 90 min to deplete the endogenous <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> pool .
Subsequently , tauroursodeoxycholate ( Sigma <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> Chemical </term> Co. , MO , USA ) dissolved in PBS was infused into the jugular vein in stepwise increasing rates from 600 -- 1,800 nmol/min/100 g body weight .
Bile was collected in 10 min fractions and analyzed for <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:18059"> lipid </term> content .
In separate experiments , following distal ligation of the bile duct and cannulation of gallbladder , bile was diverted for 30 minutes while mice were infused with sterile PBS .
Subsequently , the mice were infused continuously with 1,200 nmol/min/100 g body weight of tauroursodeoxycholate and two 30-minute fractions were collected .
<termsem="CHEBI:15889"> Sterol </term> analyses of bile was performed by GC analysis as described above .

Mouse liver microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation [ 33 ] .
Briefly , 0.1 -- 0.2 g liver was homogenized in a Potter-Elvjhem homogenizer with five volumes of buffer ( 0.25 M <termsem="CHEBI:17992"> sucrose </term> , 0.1 M <termsem="CHEBI:9754"> Tris </term> , 0.1 mM disodium <termsem="CHEBI:30378"> <termsem="CHEBI:42191"> EDTA </term> </term> , 0.1 mM <termsem="CHEBI:18320"> DTT </term> , pH 7.4 ) .
Microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugation ( 10,000 g to 100,000 g ) .
The pellets were washed and resuspended in storage buffer ( 0.1 M dipotassium <termsem="CHEBI:26020"> <termsem="CHEBI:43474"> phosphate </term> </term> , 0.05 M <termsem="CHEBI:32588"> KCl </term> , 1 mM <termsem="CHEBI:18320"> DTT </term> , 5 mM disodium <termsem="CHEBI:30378"> <termsem="CHEBI:42191"> EDTA </term> </term> , 20 % <termsem="CHEBI:17754"> glycerol </term> , pH 7.4 ) at 25 -- 30 mg <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> / ml .
<termsem="CHEBI:36080"> Protein </term> concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowry et al. [ 34 ] .
The activity of <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> 7-hydroxylase ( EC 1.14.12.17 ) was measured by an isotope incorporation method according to Shefer et al. [ 33 ] with some modifications .
The reaction mixture ( final volume 0.5 ml ) consisted of <termsem="CHEBI:26216"> potassium </term> <termsem="CHEBI:26020"> <termsem="CHEBI:35780"> phosphate </term> </term> buffer ( 100 mM K2HPO4 , 0.1 mM <termsem="CHEBI:30378"> <termsem="CHEBI:42191"> EDTA </term> </term> , 5 mM <termsem="CHEBI:18320"> DTT </term> , 30 mM <termsem="CHEBI:17154"> nicotinamide </term> , pH 7.4 ) , [ <termsem="CHEBI:36927"> 14C </term> ] - <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> ( 5  105 dpm ) solubilized in 50 l of 25 % ( wt/vol )  - <termsem="CHEBI:23456"> cyclodextrin </term> ( final concentration 0.8 % ) , and 50 -- 200 g of microsomal <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> .
The reaction was initiated by the addition of <termsem="CHEBI:16474"> NADPH </term> or an <termsem="CHEBI:16474"> NADPH </term> - generating system ( 3.4 mM <termsem="CHEBI:18009"> NADP + </term> , 30 mM <termsem="CHEBI:15954"> <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> <termsem="CHEBI:24280"> glucose </term> </term> -6 - <termsem="CHEBI:32958"> phosphate </term> </term> , 0.3 U of <termsem="CHEBI:15954"> <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> <termsem="CHEBI:24280"> glucose </term> </term> -6 - <termsem="CHEBI:32958"> phosphate </term> </term> dehydrogenase ) and continued for 15 min at 37 C .
The reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of 1 N <termsem="CHEBI:32035"> KOH </term> , 5 g of butylated <termsem="CHEBI:24751"> hydroxytoluene </term> , and 10 l of <termsem="CHEBI:16236"> ethanolic </term> <termsem="CHEBI:32035"> <termsem="CHEBI:26216"> potassium </term> <termsem="CHEBI:16234"> hydroxide </term> </term> .
[ <termsem="CHEBI:29238"> 3H </term> ] <termsem="CHEBI:17500"> 7-hydroxycholesterol </term> ( 1  104 dpm/5 g ) was added as an internal recovery standard .
After saponification at 37 C for one hour , <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> were extracted twice with 3 ml of <termsem="CHEBI:29021"> n-hexane </term> and the extracts were evaporated to dryness under <termsem="CHEBI:17997"> nitrogen </term> .
The residue was dissolved in 0.3 ml of <termsem="CHEBI:29021"> n-hexane </term> : <termsem="CHEBI:17824"> 2-propanol </term> ( 97.3 vol/vol ) and applied to a <termsem="CHEBI:30563"> silica </term> column ( 500 mg ; sep-pak , by 4 ml of <termsem="CHEBI:29021"> n-hexane </term> : <termsem="CHEBI:17824"> 2-propanol </term> ( 97.3 vol/vol ) ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:17500"> 7-hydroxycholesterol </term> was eluted with 3 ml of <termsem="CHEBI:29021"> n-hexane </term> : <termsem="CHEBI:17824"> 2-propanol </term> ( 80:20 vol : vol ) and further isolated by TLC on <termsem="CHEBI:30563"> silica </term> gel plates ( <termsem="CHEBI:30563"> Silica </term> gel 60 , EM Science , Gibbestown , NJ , USA ) with <termsem="CHEBI:35702"> diethyl ether </term> , and quantified by liquid scintillation counting using Ecolume ( ICN Radiochemicals Irvine , CA , USA ) .

<termsem="CHEBI:11814"> <termsem="CHEBI:16831"> <termsem="CHEBI:17325"> <termsem="CHEBI:30920"> HMG </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15346"> CoA </term> </term> reductase ( EC 1.1.1.3.4 ) activity was determined according to the method of Xu et al. [ 35 ] with modifications as described [ 36 ] .

The Student 's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between the groups of animals .

Isolation of Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice .
The targeting construct ( Figure 1a ) results in the potential disruption of normal splicing , as well as loss of some coding sequences involving exons 3 and 4 .
After ES cell electroporation with the linearized targeted plasmid DNA , two homologous recombinant ES clones ( out of 58 ES clones screened ) were identified .
Blastocyst injection of these resulted in five highly chimeric mice ( three males , two females ) .
One male and one female , both from the same ES clone , showed germline transmission and the female line was used to establish a multi-generational colony bred onto a C57Bl/6J background .
Heterozygous mice were fertile and gave rise to normal litter sizes .
Breeding heterozygous animals led to wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice in the expected Mendelian distribution ( data not shown ) .
Although not quantitative , Northern analyses showed that while the knockout mice showed no detectable <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> for Abcg8 , expression of Abcg5 appeared unaltered ( Figure 1c ) .
To exclude the possibility of alternative splicing with the production of a non-functional but truncated Abcg8/sterolin -2 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> that may serve as a chaperone for Abcg5/sterolin -1 , RT-PCR was performed on cDNA reverse transcribed from total liver RNA from Abcg8-deficient mice .
No <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> for Abcg8/sterolin -2 was detected containing any sequences downstream of exon 4 in the Abcg8-deficient mice , whether primers were located in exons 4 and 13 , exons 9 and 13 or exons 10 and 13 ( Figure 1d ,1 e ) .
This demonstrates that if an alternatively spliced message could potentially code for a truncated <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> , it is not detectable in the Abcg8-deficient mice .
The membrane-spanning domains of Abcg8/sterolin -2 are encoded by exons 9 -- 13 .
<termsem="CHEBI:15889"> Sterol </term> levels in Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient animals .
Elevated <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> in tissue and plasma are diagnostic of sitosterolemia .
<termsem="CHEBI:15889"> Sterol </term> levels , as determined by gas chromatography ( GC ) analysis , in plasma and tissues of the Abcg8 - / - mice are shown in Table 2 .
There were no differences in tissue weights between wild types , heterozygotes and knockouts .
Plasma <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> levels of the homozygous and heterozygous mice were decreased by 52 % and 26 % , respectively , compared to those of wild-type mice ( n = 3 all groups , Table 2 ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:26125"> Plant sterols </term> were almost undetectable in wild-type and heterozygous mice , but were significantly elevated in Abcg8 - / - mice .
Plasma <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> levels were eight - and 36-fold higher in Abcg8 - / - mice compared to wild-type mice ( 8.76  2.10 and 18.52  5.03 mg/dL , respectively , versus 1.14  0.69 and 0.50  0.55 mg/dL ) .
There was no significant difference in the plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels between heterozygous and wild-type mice .
Liver <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> content of the Abcg8 - / - mice was reduced by ~ 50 % relative to wild-type liver ( 1202  264 g/g wet weight tissue , versus 2280  310 g/g wet weight tissue , respectively ) .
The reduced <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> content was offset by a five-fold increase in <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> and a 22-fold increase in <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> ( 233.9  48.1 and 376.3  96.1 g/g wet weight tissue , respectively ) in Abcg8 - / - knockout mice compared to wild-type mice ( 52.2  15.0 and 16.7  8.6 g/g wet weight tissue , respectively , Table 2 ) .
There were no significant differences of liver <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> or <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> contents between Abcg8 + / + and Abcg8 + / - mice .
Spleen <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> contents reflected the liver profiles ( Table 2 ) .
No significant differences in brain <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> contents were observed , as would be expected , since the blood brain barrier is intact and prevents entry of these <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> in sitosterolemia ( Table 2 ) .
There were only traces of <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> in the brains from knockout animals , reflecting blood contamination during tissue harvesting .
Interestingly , the majority of the elevated tissue <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> are unesterified .
The livers of Abcg8 + / + , + / - and - / - mice have relatively similar levels of esterified <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> ( Figure 2a ) .
However , there is little if any esterification of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> or <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> ( Figure 2b ,2 c ) consistent with previous findings [ 37,38 ] .
Thus all of the expansion of tissue <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> pools are as free <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> .
FPLC analyses for <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> ( measured enzymatically and thus reflecting total <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> ) and <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglycerides </term> were performed on plasma samples from fasted animals fed a regular <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> diet .
No significant differences were observed for the <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> profiles ( Figure 3a ) , but surprisingly , the Abcg8 - / - knockout mice had a significantly higher <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglyceride </term> level in the <termsem="CHEBI:39026"> LDL lipoprotein </term> fractions compared to wild-type and heterozygous mice ( Figure 3b ) .
The size of this peak was variable between different littermate analyses , but is always increased in the knockout animals .
Total plasma <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglyceride </term> levels of the Abcg8 - / - mice were slightly higher ( 79.2  14 mg/dL compared to the wild type 63.4  13 mg/dL and heterozygotes 46.6  12 mg/dL , n = 3 for all genotypes ) .
Preliminary analyses of <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> in the isolated FPLC fractions did not show any qualitative changes in <termsem="CHEBI:39015"> apolipoproteins </term> B , E , AI , or AII .
The significance of this <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglyceride </term> rich peak remains unclear at present .
Liver gene expression and enzyme activity change in Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice .
To investigate the effects of a deficiency of Abcg8/sterolin -2 on the genes that regulate <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> metabolism , quantitative RT-PCR was performed looking at the expression levels of Abcg5 , Abcg8 , Hmgr , Cyp7a1 , Abca1 , Mdr2 , Lxr , Srebp-1c , and Srebp-2 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> in the livers of mice fed a regular <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> diet ( Figure 4a ) .
As expected , Abcg8 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> expression levels were undetectable in the Abcg8 - / - mice and were reduced by ~ 50 % in the heterozygous mice , relative to wild-type mice .
Interestingly , by quantitative RT-PCR , the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> expression of Abcg5 in the knock-out mice was also reduced by more than 60 % compared to the wild-type mice , although no changes were noted in the heterozygous mice .
Expression of <termsem="CHEBI:11814"> <termsem="CHEBI:16831"> <termsem="CHEBI:17325"> <termsem="CHEBI:30920"> HMG </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15346"> CoA </term> </term> reductase <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> was decreased by ~ 50 % and ~ 80 % in the heterozygote and knockout mice respectively , in keeping with limited observations in human patients with this disorder [ 7 ] .
To verify whether the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> changes resulted in alteration of the enzyme activity changes , liver samples were analyzed for <termsem="CHEBI:11814"> <termsem="CHEBI:16831"> <termsem="CHEBI:17325"> <termsem="CHEBI:30920"> HMG </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15346"> CoA </term> </term> reductase activity and Cyp7a1 activity ( Figure 4b ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:11814"> <termsem="CHEBI:16831"> <termsem="CHEBI:17325"> <termsem="CHEBI:30920"> HMG </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15346"> CoA </term> </term> reductase activity was reduced by 30 % and 60 % in the Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice , respectively ( Figure 4b ) , and thus reflected the changes in <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> expression .
In contrast , although the Cyp7a1 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> expression levels were essentially unchanged in the knockout mouse , Cyp7a1 activity was significantly decreased by 37 % ( P < 0.01 ) .
In the heterozygous mice , both the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> and activity of Cyp7a1 were decreased .
<termsem="CHEBI:27693"> Sitosterol </term> is known to be a direct competitive <termsem="CHEBI:35222"> inhibitor </term> of Cyp7a1 and it is likely that the elevated <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> in the liver are responsible for the inhibition in the knockout mouse [ 39 ] .
Localization of Abcg5 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> in Abcg8 - / - knockout mice .
Does the loss of Abcg8/sterolin -2 result in loss of Abcg5/sterolin -1 expression , as might be predicted from the genetic studies and more recently from the in vitro and in vivo expression studies ?
A robust antibody to mouse Abcg8/sterolin -2 is not currently available .
However , three separate groups have developed rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse Abcg5/sterolin -1 .
These three antibodies were used in Western blotting and immunohistochemistry experiments on the liver and intestine of Abcg8 - / - mice .
Western blotting of liver total membrane preparations using the three separately-developed anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 antibodies showed different results .
As has been previously published , Abcg5/sterolin -1 exists in two separate forms , the ` immature ' 75 kDa <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> and a fully glycosylated ` mature ' 93 kDa <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> [ 18,30 ] .
Using the SC anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 peptide antibody , a 75 kDa band is detected ( Figure 5a ) .
This antibody does not detect a ` mature ' 93 kDa band in either wild-type or knockout animals nor is the 75 kDa band sensitive to either Endo-H or PNGaseF ( lower panel shows same aliquots probed with anti-transferrin ) .
The AMC antibody detects the ` mature ' form of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in wild-type animals but not the knockouts .
Interestingly , the ` immature ' 75 kDa band is detected by this antibody but the band shifts with Endo-H and PNGase F treatment ( Figure 5b ) .
The UTSW antibody detects the ` mature ' and ` immature ' forms of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in wild-type animals but detects no forms in the knockout mouse ( Figure 5c ) .
What does hold true for all antibodies used against Abcg5/sterolin -1 is the detection of a 75 kDa band .
Immunohistochemistry experiments were carried out using all three antibodies .
In acute transfection studies , the SC antibody recognized over-expressed mouse Abcg5/sterolin -1 in COS-1 cells , but not mouse Abcg8/sterolin -2 ( Figure 6b ,6 c ) .
Co-transfection of COS-1 cells with both Abcg5 and Abcg8 cDNAs did not alter the pattern of immunofluorescence , although we are not able to confirm simultaneous expression of Abcg8 in cells expressing Abcg5/sterolin -1 , as we have no suitable antibody for Abcg8/sterolin -2 ( Figure 6d ) .
Nevertheless , this experiment indicates that the SC antibody can recognize Abcg5/sterolin -1 but does not cross-react with Abcg8/sterolin -2 .
Serial sections of intestinal tissue were incubated with anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 to determine the cellular location of Abcg5/sterolin -1 .
The pattern of staining of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in the intestinal sections is clearly apical and localized to the villi of the enterocytes ( Figure 6g ,6 h ,6 i ) .
Loss of Abcg8/sterolin -2 does not seem to affect this pattern of staining .
To further confirm that the antibody used recognizes Abcg5/sterolin -1 ; this pattern is blocked if the antibody is pre-incubated with the peptide to which it was raised ( Figure 6f ) .
To further confirm that Abcg5/sterolin -1 expression is preserved and may be apical , immunohistochemistry was performed in Amsterdam using the AMC antibody to stain liver sections from wild-type and knockout mice [ 30 ] .
As a control , the expression of Abcb11 , an ABC transporter known to be responsible for the export of <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salts </term> , was compared to that of Abcg5/sterolin -1 ( Figure 6j ,6 k ) .
Again , both <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> are apically localized in liver sections from wild-type mice and this pattern is essentially unperturbed in liver from knockout mice , although the expression level of Abcg5/sterolin -1 seems to be less robust qualitatively ( Figure 6l ,6 m ) .
To further confirm the apical expression of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in the knockout mice , the UTSW antibody was used to stain liver sections of wild-type and knockout mice .
Again , there is apical expression of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in both wild-type and knockout livers ( Figure 7a ,7 b ) .
Biliary secretion of <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salts </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipids </term> in Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice .
Sitosterolemic individuals have an impaired ability to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> into bile [ 40,41 ] .
We analyzed the knockout mice for any alterations in biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> handling .
Analyses of the initial basal bile secretion showed that the <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipid </term> contents in Abcg8 - / - mice were reduced as compared to wild-type mice , ( Figure 8a ,8 b ,8 c , <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> secretion not statistically significant , for <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion P = 0.01 and for <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipid </term> secretion P = 0.03 ) .
To investigate whether the defect in biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion could be ( partly ) restored by forced biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion , we infused mice with stepwise increasing doses of tauroursodeoxycholic acid ( TUDC ) .
Mice were first depleted of their endogenous <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> pools for 90 min and subsequently infused via the jugular vein with increasing doses of TUDC .
As shown in Figure 8d , <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> secretion was no different between the different genotypes during the depletion or the TUDC infusion phases of the experiment .
However , a different pattern emerged for the secretion of <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipid </term> ( Figure 8f ) .
There was no difference between wild-type and heterozygous mice , but knockout mice showed a trend of lower <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipid </term> secretion during both the depletion and infusion phase .
Even more dramatic was the effect on biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion although the <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> contents were determined enzymatically and no distinction is made as to whether this is <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> or <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> ( Figure 8e , but see below ) .
In the knockout mice , almost no stimulated <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion was noted , with an intermediate phenotype in the heterozygous mice .
In the heterozygous mice , <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion increased to reach a maximal level of about 50 % of the wild type suggesting that Abcg8/sterolin -2 is a rate-limiting step for biliary ' <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> ' secretion .
In the knockout mice , <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion remained at a constant level during the depletion phase and increased minimally upon infusion of TUDC .
Since the Abcg8 - / - mice still secreted some <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> we were interested in which biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> species were being secreted .
Therefore bile was collected from mice during a constant infusion of TUDC and analyzed by GC .
Mice were first depleted of their endogenous <termsem="CHEBI:3098"> bile acid </term> pools for 30 minutes then infused with a continuous dose of TUDC ( 1,200 nmol/min/100 g body weight ) .
The knockout mice showed a significantly diminished ability to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> , yet still maintained the ability to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> compared to wild-type mice ( Figure 9 ) .
Surprisingly , the Abcg8 + / - mice tended to show an increased ability to secrete all <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> above the levels seen in the wild-type mice , although this was not statistically significant .
The mechanism by which dietary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> is specifically absorbed and dietary non - <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> primarily excluded or the mechanism ( s ) by which the liver can selectively secrete <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> has not been elucidated .
Identification of the genetic defect ( s ) in a rare human disorder , sitosterolemia , where these processes are specifically disrupted , may finally have led to the identification of the ` transporters ' responsible for these processes .
Complete defects in one of two genes ( but not both ) , organized in a head-to-head configuration at the STSL locus , causes sitosterolemia .
We report a mouse model of sitosterolemia , with a selective , but complete , defect in one of these genes , Abcg8 .
This mouse reflects the known defects described in human sitosterolemia [ 5,7,42 ] .
Plasma and all tissues , apart from the brain , have significantly elevated <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> levels .
Homozygous knockout mice are viable , fertile and sitosterolemic .
However , fertility seems to be reduced when homozygous mice are bred together ( S Patel and J Oatis , unpublished observation ) .
This model reflects many other observed changes described in limited studies in humans .
For example , in humans , the activity of <termsem="CHEBI:11814"> <termsem="CHEBI:16831"> <termsem="CHEBI:17325"> <termsem="CHEBI:30920"> HMG </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15346"> CoA </term> </term> reductase and CYP7a1 have been reported to be low [ 7,39 ] .
In this study , we show that the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> and enzyme activities in the livers from knockout animals are also significantly reduced .
Additionally , the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme for <termsem="CHEBI:3098"> bile acid </term> synthesis , CYP7a1 , is reduced , although no changes at the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> level are noted .
This is also in keeping with previous studies that show that <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> is a direct inhibitor of this enzyme in vitro [ 39 ] .
Biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> of Abcg8-deficient mice were dramatically different compared to wild-type mice .
Measurement of biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion rates in Abcg8 - / - mice demonstrated a failure to increase <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion into bile despite exogenous infusion of <termsem="CHEBI:3098"> bile acids </term> .
Furthermore , complete loss of Abcg8/sterolin -2 results in an inability to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> into bile , although secretion of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> seemed to be preserved .
Arguably , since the body pools and plasma <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> levels in the knockout mice are so considerably elevated , perhaps the biliary <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> levels could be considered to be inappropriately low .
Despite this reservation , the finding that <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> is present in the bile suggests that <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> may be secreted independent of Abcg8/sterolin -2 .
The ability of Abcg8 - / - mice to secrete <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:16247"> phospholipid </term> into bile as compared to wild-type mice was not significantly impaired .
Collectively these data suggest that Abcg8/sterolin -2 is necessary for hepatobiliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion in mice .
Abcg8 - / - mice appeared normal and healthy maintained on a regular rodent <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> diet .
Their phenotypic features are very similar to those recently reported for a mouse deficient in both sterolins simultaneously [ 7,20 ] .
Plasma and hepatic <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels in Abcg8 - / - and Abcg5/Abcg8 knockout are increased similarly with marked decreases in <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> levels .
Interestingly , plasma <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglyceride </term> levels of the Abcg8 - / - mice were slightly higher than wild-type animals and this increased <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglyceride </term> is carried in the <termsem="CHEBI:39026"> LDL </term> fraction range , as measured by FPLC .
The significance of this is not clear , although preliminary <termsem="CHEBI:8984"> SDS </term> - PAGE analyses of all the fractions failed to reveal any differences between wild-type and knockout samples .
Hepatic levels of GC-measured <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> were greatly reduced in Abcg8 - / - mice compared to wild-type mice , yet <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> levels of <termsem="CHEBI:11814"> <termsem="CHEBI:16831"> <termsem="CHEBI:17325"> <termsem="CHEBI:30920"> HMG </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15346"> CoA </term> </term> reductase and enzyme activity are also reduced without any significant change in <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> of the Srebps .
The basis for this is not clear at present , unless the increase in non - <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterols </term> leads to a suppression of SREBP activation .
<termsem="CHEBI:27693"> Sitosterol </term> has been shown to directly inhibit Cyp7a1 activity in vitro and we presume this may account for the reduced enzyme activity [ 39 ] .
In preliminary studies , when knockout mice are placed on a low <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> diet , the activity of this enzyme , as well as the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> levels are increased ( E Klett and S Patel , unpublished observations ) .
Another prediction , based upon the enzyme and <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> levels in knockout mice , is that if these mice are placed on a high <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> / high <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> diet , they may show significant accumulation of both <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> in the body .
This may also be relevant to the human disorder where some , although not all affected individuals , manifest premature coronary artery disease .
Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice also allow us to examine the role of this <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> in biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion .
The bile is <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> poor and upon stimulation by increasing <termsem="CHEBI:22868"> bile salt </term> excretion , Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice can not respond , in contrast to the wild-type mice .
Thus , Abcg8/sterolin -2 is necessary for <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion but not necessary for <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> secretion .
It could be argued that although the biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> output is comparable to that seen in wild-type mice that this is inappropriately low , since the tissue and plasma pools of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> are so elevated in the knockout mice .
Despite this caveat , the findings of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> in significant quantities in the bile suggests that mechanisms other than via the sterolins can ` export ' some of these <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> .
Interestingly , although humans who are heterozygous for genetic defects in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 seem to be phenotypically normal , mice heterozygous for Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficiency show that <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion is impaired , but not absent .
Note that under steady-state conditions on a rodent <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> diet , heterozygous animals show no significant elevations in plasma or tissue <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> levels , suggesting that the activity of these <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> may not be rate limiting .
Furthermore , the heterozygous Abcg8 + / - mice showed higher levels of biliary <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> relative to the wild-type mice .
While the rate of total biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> secretion is reduced compared to wild-type mice , since the heterozygous mice are not sitosterolemic , either the activity of these <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> is not rate limiting or other mechanisms can compensate for a 50 % loss of activity .
On the other hand , since feeding is intermittent , a slow , but continuous secretion during post-prandial periods could easily negate any mild temporary increase in tissue and plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels in heterozygous animals .
This may be amenable to testing by placing these animals on a high <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> diet and measuring the plasma <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> levels .
Recently , Kosters et al. reported that Abcg5/Abcg8 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> expression in a variety of different mouse strains correlated with biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion rates [ 30 ] .
In their studies , although diosgenin-fed mice showed a marked increase in biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> output , <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> levels of Abcg5 and Abcg8 were not altered .
Using Western blot analyses , the <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> level of Abcg5 was also not altered by diosgenin , although Abcg8 was not measured .
They concluded that a parallel route for biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion might be operational , independent of the sterolins .
While biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion is not completely absent in the Abcg8-deficient mice it would appear that sterolin-2 plays a major role in this process .
In a genetic screen of plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels , Sehayek et al. identified three loci that may be responsible for controlling plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels and not one of these loci mapped to the murine STSL region [ 43 ] .
Thus , there is support for at least four loci that may be involved in regulating plasma <termsem="CHEBI:26125"> plant sterol </term> levels .
To date the STSL locus is the only one proven to be involved in dietary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> trafficking and the identity of the others remains to be elucidated .
We , as well as others , have proposed Abcg5/sterolin -1 and Abcg8/sterolin -2 to function as obligate heterodimers .
Thus knocking out Abcg8/sterolin -2 alone is equivalent to a functional loss of both sterolins .
It has been shown that Abcg8/sterolin -2 expression is required for correct apical trafficking of Abcg5/sterolin -1 to the apical surface in a polarized cell line and more recently in vivo by over-expression experiments [ 18,19 ] .
In experiments shown here , using three separately developed anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 antibodies , we have obtained inconsistent data regarding the trafficking of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in Abcg8 - / - mice .
Based upon classical N-glycosylation maturation it would appear that Abcg5/sterolin -1 , in the Abcg8 - / - mice , does not exit the endoplasmic reticulum .
However , by immunohistochemistry it appears that Abcg5/sterolin -1 is apically expressed in the Abcg8-deficient mice regardless of the anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 antibody used .
Interestingly , in a report of Abcg5/Abcg8 localization in canine gallbladder epithelial cells , these two <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> were found intracellularly under baseline conditions [ 44 ] .
But when given liver X receptor alpha ( LXR ) <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonist </term> , Abcg5/sterolin -1 and Abcg8/sterolin -2 appeared to be expressed at the apical surface .
In these studies the UTSW anti-Abcg5 / sterolin-1 antibody was used .
It is apparent with these conflicting data that the trafficking of these transporters is not as clear-cut .
In a recent paper , Mangrivite et al. showed that the apical sorting of rat SPNT in polarized renal epithelial cells was independent of N-glycosylation [ 45 ] .
Therefore , at this time , we can neither exclude the possibility that Abcg5/sterolin -1 expression is functional in our Abcg8/sterolin -2 deficient mice nor can we rule it out .
We have no functional assay for these <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> at present .
More extensive fractionation experiments are underway to better determine the exact compartmental location of Abcg5/sterolin -1 in the Abcg8 - / - mice .
In this context , Plsch et al. have described an Abcg5/sterolin -1 deficient mouse that maintains the ability to secrete biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> to the same extent as the wild-type mice and , when fed a LXR <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonist </term> , had higher Abcg8 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> expression and tended to secrete more biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> than wild-type mice [ 46 ] .
It has been argued that Abcg5/sterolin -1 and Abcg8/sterolin -2 are dependent upon each other for secretion of hepatic <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> into bile [ 19 ] .
Given the data presented here and from the Abcg5-deficient mouse this does not appear to be the case .
Perhaps in the previously published model a non-physiologic state has been made that generates these data .
Taken together , these animal models suggest that Abcg5/sterolin -1 and Abcg8/sterolin -2 have independent function in vivo or that there are <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> other than the sterolins that can secrete biliary <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> .
The major findings in this study are : ( 1 ) disruption of only one of the two genes comprising the STSL locus is necessary and sufficient to cause sitosterolemia , ( 2 ) that the loss of Abcg8/sterolin -2 leads to the loss of biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion and ( 3 ) Abcg5/sterolin -1 appears to be still apically-expressed despite the absence of Abcg8/sterolin -2 .
These data strongly support the direct role of Abcg8/sterolin -2 as a key player in biliary <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> secretion , although biliary <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> secretion was apparently preserved .
These data suggest that there are mechanisms other than Abcg8/sterolin -2 that allow for the secretion of <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> into bile .

Southern blot analysis of BamHI digested mouse genomic DNA , probed with [ <termsem="CHEBI:37972"> 32P </term> ] - randomly labelled probe resulting in a 6.0 kb band for wild type , a 2.7 kb band for homozygous and two bands of 5.9 and 2.6 kb for the heterozygote ( panel b ) .
Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA showed a loss of Abcg8/sterolin -2 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> in the homozygote and decreased Abcg8/sterolin -2 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> in the heterozygote , although Abcg5/sterolin -1 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> appeared relatively unaffected in the knockout mice ( panel c ) .
Probes were approximately 1.9 kb for Abcg5 and 2 kb for Abcg8 ( see Methods for more detail ) .
RT-PCR analyses of hepatic cDNA showed no Abcg8/sterolin -2 message , downstream of exon 4 in the Abcg8 - / - mice , whether primers were located in exons 4 and 13 ( panel d ) , exons 9 and 13 or exons 10 and 13 ( panel e ) .
Free versus esterified <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterol </term> levels in the livers of Abcg8 + / + , Abcg8 + / - and Abcg8 - / - mice .
<termsem="CHEBI:15889"> Sterol </term> contents of liver extracts of 12-week-old female mice fed a regular <termsem="CHEBI:33290"> chow </term> diet , determined by GC analysis show that the majority of <termsem="CHEBI:15889"> sterols </term> in all genotypes are unesterified .
Esterified <termsem="CHEBI:16113"> cholesterol </term> ( panel a ) remains relatively constant for each genotype .
However , no esterified <termsem="CHEBI:27693"> sitosterol </term> in the livers from Abcg8 + / + and Abcg8 + / - mice and very little from Abcg8 - / - mice was detected ( panel b ) .
Small amounts of esterified <termsem="CHEBI:28623"> campesterol </term> were detected in each of the genotypes ( panel c ) .
