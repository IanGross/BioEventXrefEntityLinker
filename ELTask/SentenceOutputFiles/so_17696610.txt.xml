Mouse Pachytene Checkpoint 2 ( Trip13 ) Is Required for Completing Meiotic Recombination but Not Synapsis .
In mammalian meiosis , homologous <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis is coupled with recombination .
As in most eukaryotes , mammalian meiocytes have checkpoints that monitor the fidelity of these processes .
We report that the mouse <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> ( Trip13 ) of pachytene checkpoint 2 ( PCH2 ) , an essential component of the synapsis checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans , is required for completion of meiosis in both sexes .
TRIP13-deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of oocytes around birth .
The <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes synapse fully , yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates , including RAD51 , BLM , and RPA .
These <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> also exhibited the chiasmata markers MLH1 and MLH3 , and okadaic acid treatment of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes caused progression to metaphase I with bivalent <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> .
Double <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> analysis demonstrated that the recombination and synapsis <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> Spo11 , Mei1 , Rec8 , and Dmc1 are all epistatic to Trip13 , suggesting that TRIP13 does not have meiotic checkpoint function in mice .
Our data indicate that TRIP13 is required after <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> invasion for completing a subset of recombination events , but possibly not those destined to be crossovers .
To our knowledge , this is the first model to separate recombination defects from asynapsis in mammalian meiosis , and provides the first evidence that unrepaired <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage alone can trigger the pachytene checkpoint response in mice .
It is critical that the <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> carried by sperm and eggs contain faithful representations of the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> of the individual that produced them .
During the process of meiosis , the maternal and paternal copies of each <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> `` synapse '' with each other ( become tightly associated ) , exchange <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> material </term> via the process of recombination , then separate into daughter cells in the first of two meiotic cell divisions .
The intricate <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> behavior is subject to errors , so most organisms have evolved meiotic `` checkpoints '' that monitor fidelity of <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis and repair of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage .
These checkpoints cause defective cells to self destruct rather than generate defective sperm or eggs .
We studied the effects of <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleting </term> mouse Trip13 , a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> that in distant organisms plays a key role in meiotic checkpoint control .
These experiments revealed that instead of having a checkpoint role , Trip13 is required for one of the two major classes of recombination in meiosis that is required for repairing broken <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> molecules .
The <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> still synapsed normally , but animals were sterile due to massive death of oocytes and spermatocytes .
These results indicate that , in addition to a checkpoint that responds to failed synapsis , one exists to specifically detect unrepaired <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage that is due to failed recombination .
The genesis of gametes containing an intact , haploid <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> is critical for the prevention of birth defects , and is highly dependent upon the fidelity of <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> dynamics before the first meiotic division .
Homologous <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> must pair , synapse , undergo recombination , and segregate properly to opposite poles .
Recombination , which repairs repair <termsem="SO:0000985"> double <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> </term> breaks ( DSBs ) that are <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> induced in leptonema , is coupled with synapsis in budding yeast and mammals .
While our knowledge of the assembly and nature of recombination machinery is extensive , little is known about the disassembly of recombination intermediates , recruitment of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication machinery during recombinational repair , and how the choice between different repair pathways is made .
Defects in recombination can preclude homologous <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> pairing , leave unrepaired <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> breaks , and cause aneuploidy by abrogating crossing over .
To avoid such deleterious outcomes , surveillance systems ( `` checkpoints '' ) exist to sense meiotic errors and eliminate cells containing unresolved defects .
In many organisms , including S. cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster , C. elegans , and mice [ 1 -- 4 ] , meiocytes with defects in recombination and/or <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis trigger meiotic arrest in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase I .
This response to meiotic defects is referred to as the `` pachytene checkpoint '' ( reviewed in [ 5 ] ) .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genetic </term> experiments in S. cerevisiae have identified elements of the pachytene checkpoint machinery ( reviewed in [ 5 ] ) .
In addition to meiosis-specific proteins , these include factors that play roles in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage signaling in mitotic cells [ 6 -- 10 ] .
Arabidopsis thaliana does not appear to have a pachytene checkpoint akin to that in yeast [ 11 ] , nor do male Drosophila .
The pachytene checkpoint is known to monitor two aspects of meiotic <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> metabolism in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans : ( 1 ) DSB repair and ( 2 ) <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis [ 2,12 ] .
In mice , both spermatocytes and oocytes harboring <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> that disrupt DSB repair ( such as Dmc1 , Msh5 , and Atm ) are efficiently eliminated in pachynema , but spermatocytes are much more sensitive to DSB repair -- independent synapsis defects than oocytes [ 13 -- 15 ] .
However , because recombination is required for synapsis in mice ( <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in recombination <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> such as Dmc1 cause extensive asynapsis [ 16 ] ) , it has remained formally uncertain whether there is a distinct pachytene checkpoint that responds to defects in meiotic recombination , and if so , whether it would be identical to that used in somatic cells .
The mechanisms of putative pachytene checkpoint control remain unknown in mammals , since no <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> have been identified that abolish it .
PCH2 , encoding a nucleolar-localized AAA-ATPase that was originally identified in an S. cerevisiae <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> screen for <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutants </term> that relieve pachytene arrest of asynaptic zip1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> [ 8 ] , was recently determined to be an essential component of the pachytene synapsis ( but not DSB repair ) checkpoint in yeast and worms [ 2,12 ] .
PCH2 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> are present in organisms that undergo synaptic meiosis , but not asynaptic meiosis , prompting the suggestion that a Pch2-dependent checkpoint evolved to monitor synaptonemal complex ( SC ) defects from yeast to humans [ 12 ] .
Here , we generated mice deficient for the Trip13 , the <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> of PCH2 , and evaluated whether it also plays a role in the pachytene checkpoint .
Surprisingly , while we found no evidence for checkpoint function , we did uncover a potential role for this protein in noncrossover ( NCO ) repair of meiotic DSBs .
Trip13 Is a Widely Expressed Mammalian <termsem="SO:0000855"> Ortholog </term> of PCH2 with Unusual Phylogenetic Relationships .
The mammalian <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> of PCH2 , Trip13 ( thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 13 ) , encodes a protein with extensive <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> in <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> alignable to the yeast and worm <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> ( Figure S1 ) [ 12 ] ) .
Interestingly , phylogenetic analysis of TRIP13/Pch2p shows that the mammalian protein clusters more closely to plants than it does to the evolutionarily more closely related worms and flies ( Figure 1A ; see Discussion ) .
Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR ( RT-PCR ) analysis showed Trip13 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> to be expressed in a variety of embryonic and adult tissues , including testis ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with mouse and human <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> data summarized in Unigene ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene ) .
It is also highly expressed in human and mouse oocytes [ 17 ] .

( F ) Localization of TRIP13 in testes .
<termsem="SO:0000817"> Wild-type </term> ( top ) and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> ( bottom ) testis sections were probed with chicken anti-TRIP13 , and detected with HRP-conjugated anti-chicken IgG ( brown/red staining ) .
Expression in <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> WT </term> </term> was most prominent in the nuclei of Type B spermatogonia ( Sg ) , leptotene spermatocytes ( LS ) , and early pachytene spermatocytes ( PS ) , but not late pachytene spermatocytes ( LP ) .
No nuclear staining was seen in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> testis sections , although reddish cytoplasmic background is present .
Identification of cell types was judged in part by estimating the epithelial stage of the tubules as described [ 67 ] .
( G ) TRIP13 localization in surface-spread spermatocytes .
Preparations were immunolabeled with anti-SYCP3 ( S ) and TRIP13 ( T ) .
Both individual and merged images are shown for leptotene ( Lep ) , zygotene ( Zyg ) , and pachytene ( Pac ) spermatocytes .
Nuclear staining was absent in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> .
Generation of Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutant </term> Mice .
To explore the function of TRIP13 in mammals , we generated mice with a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> trap-disrupted <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , Trip13RRB047 ( Figure 1C ; abbreviated as Trip13Gt ) .
Heterozygotes were normal in all respects , but homozygotes were present at  2/3 the expected ratio from intercrosses between heterozygotes ( 91 Trip13 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> , 183 Trip13Gt / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> , and 61 Trip13Gt/Gt ) .
Since > 90 % of prewean mice that died were <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> homozygotes , this discrepancy is apparently due to a partially penetrant lethality .
Most surviving Trip13Gt/Gt animals were grossly normal .
However , homozygotes that were semi-congenic ( N4 ) on the C57BL/6J strain were often markedly smaller and/or had kinked or shorter tails ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Developmental Phenotypes of Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutant </term> Mice .
( A ) Shown are 21-d-old littermates .
Note the shortened tail in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> , but overall similar body size .
( B ) Shown are 23-d-old littermates .
The <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> is smaller in this case , but the tail is not as truncated as the mouse in ( A ) .
( C ) <termsem="SO:0000817"> Wild-type </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> ) and homozygous Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> ( <termsem="SO:0001059"> MUT </term> ) testes .
( D ) and ( E ) are cross sections through 17.5-d-old heterozygous ( `` <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> '' ) and homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Trip13 testes , respectively .
Whereas the tubules in <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> WT </term> </term> show coordinated spermatogenesis with pachytene spermatocytes present in all tubules ( proximal to the lumen ) , developmental progression in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> is not synchronized between tubules .
Some tubules have no pachytene spermatocyes ( asterisks ) , while in others , development is somewhat disorganized ( # ) .
RT-PCR analysis of Trip13Gt expression ( Figure 1D ) revealed a low level of normally spliced <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> in testes of homozygotes that is presumably a consequence of incomplete usage of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> trap 's <termsem="SO:0000164"> splice acceptor </term> .
Western blot analysis , using a polyclonal antibody raised against a <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> encoded by <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 3 , revealed multiple <termsem="SO:0001060"> species </term> in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and heterozygous testes , one of which corresponds to the expected size of 48 kDa ( Figure 1E ) .
This and three other <termsem="SO:0001060"> species </term> were undetectable in homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> testes , but a reduced amount of an intense  38 kDa smaller band was present .
It is not clear if this corresponds to TRIP13 .
The greatly decreased Trip13 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> and <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> correct-length protein in <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> indicate that the Trip13RRB047 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is severely hypomorphic .
To determine the germ cell types in which TRIP13 is expressed , and to assess possible expression in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> by means other than Western analysis , testis sections were immunolabeled for TRIP13 using a polyclonal chicken antipeptide antibody ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The most intensely labeled cells in control testes were Type B spermatogonia and leptotene spermatocytes ( Figure 1F ) .
Zygotene/pachytene spermatocytes stained less strongly , and there was no detectable staining in late pachytene spermatocytes .
TRIP13 appeared to be nuclear localized .
There was no such staining of nuclei in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> seminiferous tubules ( Figure 1F ) .
To further assess the nuclear localization , TRIP13 was used to probe meiotic <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> prepared by surface spreading of spermatocyte nuclei .
In <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> , there was diffuse nuclear staining , and no evidence of concentration on SC cores ( marked by the axial element protein SYCP3 ) at any meiotic substage ( Figure 1G ) .
TRIP13 signal was noticeably absent in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> meiotic nuclei .
Infertility Due to Meiotic Disruption in TRIP13-Deficient Meiocytes .
Homozygotes of both sexes had small gonads ( Figure 2C ; see below ) and were invariably sterile .
Ovaries of adult Trip13Gt/Gt females were severely dysmorphic and had few or no follicles ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
The majority of oocyte loss occurred in late embryogenesis or early in postnatal development , since 2 d postpartum ovaries were markedly smaller than those of control littermates , and were lacking oocytes or newly forming follicles ( Figure 3C and 3D ) .
Thus , oocytes failed to progress to the dictyate ( resting ) phase .
Since we observed oocytes with pachytene stage <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> in 17.5 d Trip13Gt/Gt embryonic ovaries ( unpublished data ) , this indicates that oocytes were eliminated somewhere between pachynema and dictyate .

Histological sections of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> testes revealed a lack of postmeiotic cell types that are characteristic of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> seminiferous tubules ( Figure 3E ) .
The most developmentally advanced seminiferous tubules contained adluminal spermatocytes with condensed chromatin characteristic of pachynema ( Figure 3F ) .
The absence of coordinated spermatogenic progression beyond this stage is indicative of a pachytene arrest .
This was revealed more clearly by <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> analysis ( see below ) .
Some sections of adult seminiferous tubules contained postmeiotic spermatids ( Figure 3G ) , although we saw no motile epididymal sperm .
These drastic meiotic defects stand in contrast to yeast and C. elegans , in which <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of Pch2 alone has minor effects on spore/gamete development [ 2,8 ] .
TRIP13-Deficient Meiocytes Undergo Homologous <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> Synapsis Despite the Presence of Unrepaired DSBs in Pachynema .
To better characterize the degree of meiotic progression in Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes , we immunostained <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> spreads for SYCP3 and SYCP1 , components of the axial/lateral elements and transverse filaments , respectively , of the synaptonemal complex ( SC ) .
Pachytene spermatocyte nuclei from postpubertal <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> testes could assemble normal SC cores and exhibited full synapsis of <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> as judged by colabeling of SYCP1 and SYCP3 along the full lengths of all autosomes ( Figure 4A ) .
Additionally , the X and Y <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> were normally synapsed at their pseudoautosomal <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
More prepubertal ( 17.5 d postpartum ) <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes contained asynaptic or terminally asynapsed <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> than age-matched controls ( 62.5 % versus 25 % , respectively ; Figure 4B ) .
We attribute this to a delay in the first wave of postnatal spermatogenesis ( Figure 2D and 2E ) , likely related to systemic developmental retardation ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Nevertheless , since Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes progress to pachynema with no gross SC abnormalities , and oocytes were eliminated soon after birth ( a characteristic of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> [ 13 ] ) , this suggested that unrepaired DSBs are responsible for eventual meiotic arrest and elimination .
Immunohistochemical Analysis of Pachytene Spermatocyte <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosomes </term> .
Surface-spread <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> were immunolabeled with the indicated antibodies and fluorophores .

There were no differences seen between heterozygotes and <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> spermatocytes .

( O ) In <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> late pachytene spermatocytes , RAD51 is present only at background levels .
( P ) As in ( F ) , extensive RAD51 staining delineates SCs in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> pachytene nuclei ( indicated by white arcs ) .
MLH1 foci colocalize with these tracts ( arrows ) at the typical 1 -- 2 foci per <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> as in ( M ) .
To elucidate the cause of meiotic arrest , we analyzed meiotic <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> with a variety of markers that are diagnostic of recombination and synapsis .
Recombination in Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes appeared to initiate normally as judged by the presence of H2AX in leptonema ( Figure S2A and S2B ) , which reflects the presence of meiotically induced DSBs [ 18 ] .
RAD51 and/or DMC1 , components of early recombination nodules ( ERNs ) , was also present as abundant foci in Trip13Gt/Gt zygotene spermatocytes ( unpublished data ; the anti-RAD51 antibody cross-reacts with DMC1 ) , indicating that recombinational repair of DSBs is initiated .
The cohesin complex , which is essential for completion and/or maintenance of synaptic associations , appeared to assemble normally as judged by immunolabeling for the meiosis-specific cohesins STAG3 ( Figure S2C and S2D ) and REC8 ( unpublished data ) .
Because yeast PCH2 localizes to <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeres </term> in a Sir3p-dependent manner , we tested for possible <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomere </term> defects by immunolabeling for TRF2 , a component of a protein complex that plays an essential role in <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomere </term> protection [ 19 ] .
It was localized to <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeres </term> of both fully synapsed and telomerically asynaptic <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> ( Figure S2E and S2F ) .
Defects in DSB repair became apparent in pachynema upon probing of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocyte nuclei with antibodies against molecules involved in various stages of recombination .
In > 99 % of Trip13Gt/Gt <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> spreads , BLM helicase ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , RAD51/DMC1 ( Figure 4E and 4F ) , H2AX ( Figure 4G and 4H ) , and TOPBP1 ( Figure 4I and 4J ) all persisted abnormally on synapsed <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> .
For RAD51/DMC1 , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> pachytene spermatocytes contained 138  6 foci ( compared to 11  3 foci in <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> , most of which were on the XY body ) , down from 218  13 in zygonema ( compared to 220  13 foci in <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> ) .
TOPBP1 is a <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage -- checkpoint protein involved in ATM protein -- dependent activation of ATR protein [ 20,21 ] .
It binds <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> of DSBs and unsynapsed regions of meiotic <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> [ 22,23 ] .
BLM has been reported to colocalize with markers ( RPA and MSH4 ) of recombination at <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> distinct from those that become resolved as crossovers ( CO ) [ 24 ] .
We therefore assessed the distribution of RPA , the ssDNA binding protein , which is normally present at focal sites of synapsing meiotic <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> before disappearing in mid-pachynema [ 25 ] .
It is thought to bind <termsem="SO:0000297"> D-loops </term> of recombination intermediates [ 26 ] .
RPA also persisted on pachytene <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> ( Figure 4K and 4L ) .
These data indicate that unrepaired DSBs , or unresolved recombination intermediates , remain in pachynema and activate a <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage checkpoint system .
It should be noted that <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> affected by meiotic sex <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> inactivation ( MSCI ) and meiotic silencing of unpaired chromatin ( MSUC ) are heavily stained by antibodies for several DSB repair-associated molecules , including H2AX .
H2AX phosphorylation due to MSCI and MSUC is conducted by ATR , not ATM [ 27 -- 29 ] .
Since <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> are fully synapsed , and MSUC is known to occur only as a result of asynapsis , the decoration of Trip13Gt/Gt <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair markers is probably attributable to incomplete <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair rather than transcriptional silencing .
Consistent with the presence of rare ( < 1 % ) Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes devoid of persistent <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair markers , and testis histology showing some degree of postmeiotic progression ( Figure 3G ) , we observed both diplotene nuclei that lacked autosomal RAD51/DMC1 and H2AX ( Figure S3A -- S3D ) , and also metaphase I spreads with 20 bivalents ( Figure S3E -- S3F ) .
Since Trip13Gt may not be a complete null , these diplotene and metaphase I spermatocytes might arise by virtue of having sufficient <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> TRIP13 .
CO-Associated Markers Appear Normally in the Absence of TRIP13 .
The persistence of BLM on Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocyte <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> suggests that at least a subset of the unrepaired DSBs correspond to <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> of defective NCO recombinational repair .
To assess whether CO recombination occurs in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> , we examined the distribution of the mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MLH3 , which are normally detectable as foci in mid-late pachynema and mark the <termsem="SO:0000001"> locations </term> of chiasmata [ 30,31 ] .
Remarkably , MLH1/3 foci were formed ; we observed 1 -- 2 foci / <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> as in <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> and at typical overall levels ( MLH3 = 23  2 , N = 10 ; [ 30,32 ] ) on mid-late pachytene <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> ( Figure 4M and 4N ; MLH1 not shown ) .
Since < 1 % of Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene nuclei had normal repair ( as judged by absence of persistent DSB repair markers ; see above ) , but most of the pachytene nuclei had MLH1/3 foci , it was unlikely that the MLH1/3 foci formed only on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> with fully repaired DSBs .
To test this directly , we conducted double staining for MLH1 and RAD51/DMC1 .
MLH1 foci were present on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> that also contained numerous RAD51/DMC1 foci ( Figure 4O and 4P ) .
To assess whether these MLH1/3 foci in Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I , we treated testicular cells from 17.5 -- 20.5-d-old control ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) , Trip13Gt/Gt , and Dmc1  /  mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA ) , a chemical that induces degradation of the SC , <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> condensation , and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33 ] .
Fifteen metaphase spreads were identified for each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> .
Whereas all of the Dmc1  /  spreads had  35 or more condensed <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> , all of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> and Trip13Gt/Gt spreads had 20 -- 25 , suggesting that the MLH1/3 foci in Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> of completed , or near-completed , COs. .
Because the preparations were made from whole testes , it is possible that the univalent-containing metaphases from Dmc1  /  mice were from spermatogonia , not spermatocytes .
TRIP13 Deficiency Does Not Alleviate Meiotic Arrest Phenotypes of <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Mutants </term> </term> Defective in Synapsis .
To determine if TRIP13 deficiency prevents apoptosis triggered by asynapsis as in C. elegans , we analyzed mice that were doubly <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> for Spo11 and Trip13 .
SPO11 is a transesterase that is essential for the creation of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> programmed DSB during leptonema of many organisms , including mice [ 18 ] .
In C. elegans , spo-11 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> gametes have extensive asynapsis , which triggers PCH-2 dependent apoptosis in pachynema [ 2 ] .
In mice , Spo11  /  spermatocytes are severely defective in homologous <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis [ 34,35 ] , and arrest with <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> in a state characteristic of the zygotene/pachytene transition ( Figure 3H ) .
Spermatocytes in Trip13Gt/Gt Spo11  /  testes progressed maximally to that point before undergoing death ( Figs 3I ) , well before the spindle checkpoint that eliminates achiasmate spermatocytes [ 36 ] .
There was no evidence of metaphase I spermatocytes or postmeiotic spermatids in these testes , unlike those seen in Trip13 single <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ( Figure 3G ) .
In contrast to the complete synapsis in Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 5A ) , in which SPO11 is available in leptonema to initiate ( via DSB induction , Figure S2A and S2B ) a recombination-driven homolog search , <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis in doubly <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes was highly disrupted as in Spo11 single <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ( Figure 5B and 5C ) .
Identical studies were performed with mice deficient for Mei1 , a vertebrate-specific <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> also required for DSB formation and <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis [ 37 ] , with similar results ( Figure 3J and 3K ; immunocytology not shown ) .
Immunocytological Analysis of Trip13 Compound <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Mutants </term> </term> .
Surface-spread <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> were immunolabeled with the indicated antibodies and fluorophores .
<termsem="SO:0001027"> Genotypes </term> are indicated , as are those panels in which dual staining patterns are merged .
Note that ( H ) and ( I ) are at lower magnification to show multiple nuclei .
In yeast , <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of PCH2 alleviates the pachytene arrest caused by asynaptic <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> zip1 and zip2 [ 8 ] .
Although mouse SYCP1 might be a functional equivalent of Zip1p , because Sycp1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes arrest at approximately the same point as Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , there would be no opportunity to observe bypass of Sycp1  /  .
Since Zip2p is present at <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> of axial associations , even in zip1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , it has been suggested that Zip2p promotes initiation of <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis [ 38 ] .
These observations raise the possibility that in yeast , Pch2p responds to synapsis polymerization rather than initiation .
To test this , we performed epistasis analysis with a Rec8 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( Rec8Mei8 , abbreviated as Rec8  ) .
Meiotic <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> of Rec8 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes undergo apparent homolog pairing and interhomolog synaptic initiation , but are defective in DSB repair and fail to maintain interhomolog synapsis [ 39,40 ] .
Rather , sister chromatids appear to synapse and are bound by SYCP1 along their axes .
Rec8 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> do not progress to diplonema or metaphase I. Double <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> analysis indicated that Rec8 is epistatic to Trip13 .
As in the Spo11 and Mei1 experiments , histology of testes deficient for both REC8 and TRIP13 resembled the Rec8 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> , with no evidence of progression to metaphase I that occurs in Trip13Gt/Gt mice ( Figure 3L and 3M ) .
Immunocytological analysis of spread <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> showed a failure of homologous <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis in both the Rec8  /  and Rec8  /  Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes , as previously reported for Rec8 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ( Figure 5D and 5E ) [ 39,40 ] .
Although subsequent reports indicate otherwise [ 10,12 ] , <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of PCH2 in yeast was originally reported to alleviate meiotic arrest caused by deficiency for the meiosis-specific RecA <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> DMC1 [ 8 ] .
To investigate this relationship in mice , we constructed animals doubly <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> for Trip13 and Dmc1 .
As in Dmc1  /  mice , in which spermatocytes undergo meiotic arrest from defective DSB repair and failed <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> synapsis [ 16 ] , spermatogenesis in Dmc1  /  Trip13Gt/Gt testes was uniformly arrested at the point where spermatocytes contained chromatin characteristic of zygonema/pachynema ( Figure 3N ) .
Immunocytological analysis indicated that both Dmc1  /  and Dmc1  /  Trip13Gt/Gt <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> had extensive asynapsis compared to Trip13Gt single <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ( Figure 5F -- 5H ) , and all had persistent RAD51/DMC1 foci and phosphorylated H2AX ( H2AX ; Figure 5I -- 5L ) , confirming that Dmc1 is epistatic to Trip13 .
Doubly <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> females had residual ovaries , phenocopying Dmc1  /  and Trip13Gt/Gt single <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ( unpublished data ) .
Meiotic Defects in Trip13Gt/Gt Oocytes Are DSB-Dependent .
Epistasis analysis of females was insightful with respect to the cause of arrest in Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Both Mei1  /  / Trip13Gt/Gt and Spo11  /  / Trip13Gt/Gt females had ovaries with numerous follicles , identical to Mei1 and Spo11 single <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ( Figure 3O -- 3R ) .
Thus , Spo11 and Mei1 are epistatic to Trip13 in oogenesis , just as they are to Dmc1 [ 13,41 ] .
This demonstrates that oocyte loss in Trip13Gt/Gt females is dependent on DSB formation .
In conjunction with the immunohistochemical data , these data provide strong evidence that meiotic arrest in Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice is due to defects in DSB repair .
As expected , ovaries of Rec8 Trip13 double <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> were devoid of oocytes as were those from either single <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> ( Figure 3B , 3S , and 3T ) .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genetic </term> experiments in S. cerevisiae provided evidence that the pachytene checkpoint monitors and responds to recombinational DSB repair and synapsis independently .
Wu and Burgess concluded that the repair checkpoint is RAD17-SAE2 dependent , while the synapsis checkpoint is PCH2-ZIP1 dependent [ 12 ] .
Of these four <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , SAE2 and ZIP1 do not have clear mammalian <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> ( although SYCP1 may be a functional <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> of ZIP1 ) , and <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of the mouse RAD17 <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> , Rad1 , presumably causes embryonic lethality [ 42 ] .
Thus , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutational </term> analysis of mouse Pch2 ( Trip13 ) , which is also critical for the synapsis checkpoint in C. elegans [ 2 ] , was the best remaining option to evaluate potential functional conservation in mammalian meiotic checkpoint control .
Our results demonstrate that in mice , the primary meiotic function of TRIP13 is in recombination itself .
We found no evidence that it is involved in pachytene checkpoint control .
Our data suggest that while recombination events destined to be resolved as COs can proceed normally in Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , DSBs that enter the NCO repair pathway are incompletely resolved or processed inefficiently .
This hypothesis is compatible with current knowledge of meiotic recombination pathways .
In S. cerevisiae , CO and NCO pathways are distinct [ 43 ] ; they have different recombination intermediates , and are dependent upon different proteins [ 44,45 ] .
Mice also appear to have independent CO versus NCO recombination pathways [ 46 ] .
As in yeast , both require SPO11-induced breaks , but only the CO pathway requires MLH1 .
Both types of recombinant products are formed by mid-late pachynema .
Another possibility is that the recombination defects are a result of defective intersister recombination .
However , this type of DSB repair is suppressed in meiotic cells .
Ablation of RAD54 , which mediates intersister recombination in yeast , does not significantly disrupt meiosis in either yeast or mice [ 47,48 ] .
Interestingly , RAD54-deficient spermatocytes display abnormal persistence of RAD51 foci on pachytene <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> , similar to those in TRIP13 mice , but there are no deleterious effects on meiotic progression or fertility [ 49 ] .
Data from budding yeast also indicate that Pch2p functions in recombination .
<termsem="SO:0000045"> Deletion </term> of PCH2 delays meiotic progression by  2 h in SK1 yeast , and causes a minor decrease in ascus formation [ 50 ] .
DSBs persist > 2 h longer in pch2 yeast than in <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> , and hyperresection of DSBs in dmc1 pch2 double <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> is lower than in dmc1 cells [ 10 ] .
Additionally , it was reported that pch2 yeast had a meiosis I delay dependent on the RAD17 -- SAE2 checkpoint that monitors recombination intermediates [ 12 ] .
However , the exact role of TRIP13 ( or Pch2 ) in recombination is unclear .
Because synapsis occurs in TRIP13-deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation ( activity of SPO11 and MEI1 ) , we suggest that TRIP13 functions after homology recognition and <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> exchange , and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so ( because OA treated resulted in bivalent <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> ) .
One possibility for TRIP13  s role in recombination is that it is directly involved in a step specific to resolution of NCO recombination intermediates .
Another possibility is that TRIP13 is required for disassembly of NCO recombinational repair complexes [ 51 ] containing those proteins that persist abnormally on Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> .
Notably , TRIP13 has two putative ATPase <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> , a signature of AAA-ATPase ClpA/B chaperones that perform protein or protein / <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> complex disassembly [ 52 ] .
These potential recombination roles might not be limited to meiosis , since Trip13 is widely transcribed and the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> animals exhibited developmental defects .
Finally , TRIP13 might play an indirect role , such as providing a `` licensing '' signal for the resolution of NCO intermediates and completion of meiosis .
Regarding the cause of cell death in Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , our data indicate that this is triggered by defective DSB repair rather than asynapsis .
We base this conclusion on two observations : ( 1 ) oocyte elimination is dependent upon DSB formation and ( 2 ) synapsis is normal in spermatocytes of adult testes .
Indeed , this <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> is unique in that recombination defects occur in the absence of asynapsis ( e.g. , as in Dmc1 knockouts ) .
Thus , the Trip13 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> provides the first evidence that unrepaired <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage alone can trigger the mammalian pachytene checkpoint response .
Furthermore , our results allow us to conclude that oocytes and spermatocytes share a similar , if not identical , <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage pachytene checkpoint that is decoupled from a synapsis checkpoint .
Interestingly , we found that OA treatment of Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes could propel them into MI , despite a report that the same did not occur when <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> pachytene spermatocytes were treated with the DSB-inducing agents gamma radiation or etoposide [ 53 ] .
It is possible that the nascent induction of DSBs in pachynema evokes a checkpoint response that can not be bypassed by OA , whereas the post - <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> invasion lesions in TRIP13-deficient spermatocytes do not .
TRIP13 was originally discovered to be an interactor with rat thyroid receptor beta ( THRB ; [ 54 ] ) , but the relationship between THRB and TRIP13 in meiosis is unknown .
Interestingly , we observed that THRB is distributed diffusely throughout <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> spermatocyte nuclei but is excluded from the XY ( sex ) body ( unpublished observations ) , a compartmentalized nuclear domain beginning in pachynema , in which the sex <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> become heterochromatinized and transcriptionally silenced in the process of MSCI [ 55 ] .
However , the XY body appeared intact in most <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> spermatocytes upon probing with several markers of XY heterochromatinization ( unpublished observations ) .
Considering that THRB knockout mice are viable and fertile [ 56 ] , the functional relationship between TRIP13 and its receptor THRB in meiosis is unclear .
Given the high similarity of PCH2 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> throughout the eukaryotic world , one or more essential functions of this protein must be conserved .
Since TRIP13 does not exhibit checkpoint function in mice , we surmise that the TRIP13/PCH2 ancestral protein had a function in recombination that persists to the present .
Notably , A. thaliana does not appear to have a meiotic checkpoint activity that eliminates <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> meiocytes in a manner analogous to organisms such as mice , budding yeast , and female Drosophila [ 11,57 ] , and mammalian TRIP13 is more similar to Arabidopsis PCH2 than the fly or worm proteins ( Figures 1A and S1 ) .
The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant PCH2 may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function ( namely recombination , although the role of PCH2 in plants has yet to be determined ) , and the absence of checkpoint function .
Nevertheless , the evolutionary relationships between animals , fungi , and plants ( which are discordant with PCH2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> phylogeny ) do not allow parsimonious models addressing the points in time that checkpoint functions in PCH2 were gained or lost .
It is possible that its checkpoint function evolved independently in worms and budding yeast .
The picture will become clearer as the function of PCH2 in other organisms is elucidated .
The nature of the synapsis checkpoint in male mice remains unidentified .
One possible candidate is Dot1 ( PCH1 in yeast ) , a histone methyltransferase silencing factor that is required for pachytene arrest of zip1 and dmc1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> in yeast [ 58 ] , and for preventing RAD54-mediated recombinational DSB repair between sister chromatids .
However , DOT1 acts upstream of PCH2 .
Given that TRIP13 does n't have checkpoint function in mice , a potential role for mammalian DOT1 in the pachytene checkpoint is dubious but awaits investigation .
Recently , it was shown that the TRP53 <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> TRP63 is required for <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage -- induced death of dictyate-stage primordial oocytes , leading to the suggestion that it is involved in monitoring <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> integrity [ 59 ] .
However , this activity occurs subsequent to a pachytene checkpoint .
As alluded to earlier , a complicating problem for studying potential meiotic checkpoint <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in mice is that as in yeast , such <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> often have mitotic functions ( such as RAD24 [ 7 ] ) , and their ablation can cause lethality [ 42 ] .
Unless mammalian pachytene checkpoint components have <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> with similar functions in organisms such as yeast , their identities are likely to remain elusive .

The <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - trapping <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> used to create this line , pGT1lxf , was designed to create an in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> fusion between the 5  <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> of the trapped <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and a reporter , geo ( a fusion of -galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - trapped <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> creates a <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 1 -- 3 of Trip13 and geo .
To identify the exact <termsem="SO:0000366"> <termsem="SO:0000046"> insertion </term> site </term> within <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 3 , PCR was performed using one <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> trap <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , and the other <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> at various <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 3 pointing towards the 3  end of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000006"> Product </term> from a productive reaction was sequenced , revealing that the <termsem="SO:0000366"> <termsem="SO:0000046"> insertion </term> site </term> was 445 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> into <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 3 .
Genotyping of mice .
Three <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> were used to distinguish <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of Trip13 : <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> 1 , 5  - CGTCGCTCCATTGCTTTGTGC-3  ; <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> 2 , 5  - AGTAGTGGTACACTGTATTTTTGCTTTCATTGA-3  ; and <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> 3 , 5  - GTAGATCCCGGCGCTCTTACCAA-3  .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primers </term> 1 and 2 are located upstream and downstream , respectively , of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> trap <termsem="SO:0000667"> insertion </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 3 .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primer </term> 3 corresponds to pGTlxf <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primers </term> 1 and 2 amplify a 700 - <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> band </term> from a <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ; <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> 1 and 3 amplify a 540 - <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from a <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Separate reactions were used to assay the presence or absence of each amplicon from a <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> sample .
The cycling conditions were : 94 C 2 min ; 35 cycles of 94 C 30 s , 57 C 45 s , and 72 C 50 s ; and 72 C 2 min .
RT-PCR .
Total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> was isolated from adult testes with the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , http://www.qiagen.com ) , and 4.0 g was <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> dT -- primed and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II ( Stratagene , http://www.stratagene.com ) .
The entire Trip13 <termsem="SO:0000010"> protein - <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding </term> sequence </term> was amplified with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> 5  - ATGGACGAGGCGGTG-3  and 5  - TCAAACATAAGCTGAAAGTT-3  .
The cycling conditions were : 94 C 2 min ; 94 C 30s , 55 C 45 s , and 72 C 80 s for 35 cycles ; and 72 C 2 min .
The <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> for amplifying the Med31 <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> as control were : 5  - ATGGCCGCGGCCGTCGCTATGG-3  and 5  - TCATTTCCCTGCTGTGTTATTCTGCTGCTGCTGC-3  .
The cycling conditions were : 94 C 2 min ; 94 C 30 s , 55 C 30 s , and 72 C 35 s for 35 cycles ; and 72 C 2 min .
Development and purification of chicken antibodies .
A <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> corresponding to <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> 25 -- 40 of TRIP13 , VLQRSGSTAKKEDIK , was conjugated to KLH and used to immunize chickens ( done by Sigma Genosys , http://www.sigmaaldrich.com ) .
Polyclonal IgY was isolated from eggs with the Eggcellent Chicken IgY Purification kit ( Pierce , http://www.piercenet.com ) .
IgY antibodies were then affinity purified using the immunizing <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> .
Western blotting .
50 g of testis extract in RIPA buffer was separated by 8 % SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a Pure Nitrocellulose membrane ( Bio-Rad , http://www.biorad.com ) .
The membrane was incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human TRIP13 antibody ( 18-003-42687 ; Genway , http://www.genwaybio.com ) .
According to the manufacturer , the immunogen was a <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> embedded in <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> we deduced to correspond to <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 3 .
Binding was detected by chemiluminescence ECL kit ( Pierce ) using a rabbit anti-chicken IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Pierce ) .
Histological analyses .
Testes or ovaries were fixed in Bouin 's , embedded in paraffin , sectioned at 6 m , and stained by hematoxylin and eosin .
Antigen retrieval for immunohistochemistry of testis sections was as described [ 60 ] .
Oocyte and follicle numbers were counted as described [ 61 ] .
Only follicles containing an oocyte with a clearly visible nucleus were scored .
Immunocytochemistry .
Immunolabeling of surface-spread spermatocytes and oocytes was performed as described [ 39,62 ] .
To reach conclusions on the pattern of staining for various proteins , 30 ( unless otherwise indicated ) well-spread nuclei of particular meiotic stages were first identified under the fluorescent microscope on the basis of SYCP3 or STAG3 staining , then imaged at both appropriate wavelengths to determine the pattern of second proteins with focal patterns such as RAD51 or RPA .
Unless otherwise indicated , the panels shown in the figures were the exclusive or predominant patterns seen .
The exception for this approach was in the case of staining for MLH1 or MLH3 plus RAD51 ( in which case SYCP3 or STAG3 was not available to find <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> cores ) .
Nuclei in this situation were identified first by MLH1/3 foci clustering , then imaged for both fluorescent wavelengths .
Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows : mouse anti-SCP3 ( 1:500 ; Abcam , http://www.abcam.com ) ; rabbit anti-SYCP1 ( 1:1,000 ; a gift from C. Heyting ) [ 63 ] ; rabbit anti-REC8 ( 1:100 ; a gift from C.

All secondary antibodies conjugated with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 ( Molecular Probes , http://probes.invitrogen.com/ ) were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 .
All images were taken with a 100  objective lens under immersion oil .
Metaphase I spermatocyte spreads and OA treatment .
Metaphase fixed spermatocytes from 8-mo-old Trip13RRB047 homozygotes , using 23-d-old <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice as control , were prepared and stained with Giemsa as described [ 64 ] .
For OA treatment , cells were exposed to 5 M OA ( Calbiochem , http://www.emdbiosciences.com ) for 6 h at 32 C in a humidified environment of 5 % CO2 before spreading [ 65 ] .
These preparations were stained with DAPI to visualize metaphase nuclei and <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> .
Phylogenetic analyses .
TRIP13 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> were identified by BLASTP searches of Genbank and other sources providing <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> models such as Ensembl .
The selected <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> can be found in Table S1 .
<termsem="SO:0001237"> Amino acid </term> alignments were done with Clustal W , using the default settings with and without <termsem="SO:0000045"> removing </term> the <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> outside of the AAA-ATPase central <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
The trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method with Poisson correction .
The reliability of internal branches was assessed by using 500 bootstrap replicates , and <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> with <termsem="SO:0000730"> gaps </term> were ignored in this analysis .
Neighbor-joining searches were conducted by using the computer program MEGA3 [ 66 ] .
