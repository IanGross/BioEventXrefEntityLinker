Identification and targeted disruption of the mouse <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encoding ESG1 ( PH34/ECAT2/DPPA5 ) .
Embryonic stem cell-specific <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( ESG ) 1 , which encodes a KH - <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> containing protein , is specifically expressed in early embryos , germ cells , and embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
Previous studies identified <termsem="SO:0000040"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> clones </term> containing the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and five <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> .
However , their <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> localizations </term> or physiological functions have not been determined .
A Blast search of mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> databases failed to locate the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
We identified several <termsem="SO:0000153"> bacterial artificial <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> </term> containing the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and an additional ESG1-like <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> with a similar <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure from <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 9 .
The ESG1-like <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> contained a multiple critical <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> , indicating that it was a duplicated <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0001416"> 5 ' flanking region </term> of the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , but not that of the <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> , exhibited strong <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> and <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> activity in undifferentiated ES cells by luciferase reporter assay .
To study the physiological functions of the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , we <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaced </term> this <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> in ES cells with a -geo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> by homologous recombination .
Despite specific expression in early embryos and germ cells , ESG1 - / - mice developed normally and were fertile .
We also generated ESG1 - / - ES cells both by a second independent homologous recombination and directly from blastocysts derived from heterozygous intercrosses .
Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of ESG1 in these cells .
These ES cells demonstrated normal morphology , proliferation , and differentiation .
The mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , together with a duplicated <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> , is located on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 9 .
Despite its specific expression in pluripotent cells and germ cells , ESG1 is dispensable for self-renewal of ES cells and establishment of germcells .
Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were first derived from the blastocysts of mice in 1981 [ 1,2 ] and humans in 1998 [ 3 ] .
ES cells have two important properties : theability to maintain pluripotency , which is the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells , and rapid proliferation .
These characteristics make mouse ES cells an essential component of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting technology .
These qualitiesalso make human ES cells attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy to treat various diseases , including spinal cord injuries and juvenile diabetes .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the pluripotency and rapid proliferation of ES cells are currently a major focus of the field of stem cell biology [ 4-6 ] .
To identify molecules essential in ES cells for these properties , several groups have utilized transcriptome analyses to identify <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> specifically expressed in ES cells and early embryos .
These analyses , including <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> microarray analyses [ 7 ] and <termsem="SO:0000345"> expressed sequence tag </term> analyses [ 8-12 ] , identified several common <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> , including ESG1 that was also designated dppa5 or ECAT2 .
ESG1 was originally identified as a <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> Ph34 that was down-regulated by retinoic acid in embryonic carcinoma cells [ 13 ] .
The expression of this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was confined in mice to early embryos and germ cells [ 14 ] .
It is also expressed in pluripotent cells , including ES cells , embryonic germ cells , and multipotent germline stem cells [ 15 ] .
ESG1 encodes a <termsem="SO:0000104"> polypeptide </term> of 118 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> that contains a single KH <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , which is an <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> - binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> [ 16 ] .
It remains unclear , however , if ESG1 functions as an <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> - binding protein or the roles it plays in ES cells and mice .
Previous <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> library screening by identified <termsem="SO:0000040"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> clones </term> containing the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and seven <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> [ 17 ] .
Two of these <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> exhibit a similar <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> - <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> structure as the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , indicating their generation by <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> duplication .
The five remaining <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> did not contain any <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> , indicating that these were generated by retrotransposition of ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> localizations </term> of the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> , however , have not been reported .
In this study , we determined the structure of the mouse <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encoding this protein and related <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> .
We also performed <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting to determine the physiological function of ESG1 .
<termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosomal </term> localization </term> and structures of mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000336"> psedogenes </term> .
To determine the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> localizations </term> of the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> , we performed a Blast analysis of the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> database with the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequence </term> as a query .
We identified several putative <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> without <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> 1 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 17 , and X ( Figure 1 ) .
In addition , two <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> - less <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> were identified in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> for which the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> localization </term> remained unmapped .
While these <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudodgenes </term> have significant <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> to ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> , they could not produce functional proteins , because of critical <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
This result suggests that there are a larger number of <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> - less <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> than previously anticipated .
Existence of multiple <termsem="SO:0000043"> retropseudogenes </term> is a hallmark of pluripotent cell-specific <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 18 ] .
ESG1pseudogenes identified by a Blast search of mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> databases .
<termsem="SO:1000002"> Substitution mutations </term> are indicated by black lines .
<termsem="SO:0000188"> Intron </term> - like <termsem="SO:0000730"> gap </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> are indicated with triangles .
<termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosomal </term> localizations </term> are shown on the right .
On <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 9 , we identified a <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> similar to the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> that included two putative <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> .
These putative first and second <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> , however , contained ( 4 ) multiple <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> of the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequence </term> .
The putative third <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> was identical to that of the previously reported ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Also on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 9 , we identified another <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> that was similar , but not identical , to the third <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> of the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
These findings suggest that these ESG1-like <termsem="SO:0000830"> sequences on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> </term> 9 have not been correctly assembled .
To obtain <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> containing the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , we screened the <termsem="SO:0000153"> bacterial artificial chromosome </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> ) <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> pool by PCR using <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pairs that would only amplify the real <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , not the <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> .
We obtained two independent , but <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> .
Southern blot analyses and sequencing demonstrated that these <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> contained a <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> exhibiting complete identity with ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> that was interrupted by two putative <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> ( Figure 2A ) .
The two <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron sequences </term> begin with GT and terminate with AG , fulfilling the GT-AG rule of <termsem="SO:0001421"> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> - <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> junctions </term> [ 19 ] .
The <termsem="SO:0001416"> 5 ' flanking region </term> of this <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> exhibited strong <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> / <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> activity by luciferase reporter assays in undifferentiated ES cells , but not in somatic cells ( Figure 3 ) .
The same <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> showed much weaker activity after induction of differentiation by retinoic acid .
We concluded that this <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> containing the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and a <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000336"> PS </term> ) .

B ) <termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> comparison of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000336"> PS </term> revealed that these are <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> from eight <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> upstream of the first <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> to 675 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> downstream of the third <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> .
<termsem="SO:1000002"> Substitution mutations </term> are indicated by black lines .

<termsem="SO:0000167"> Promoter </term> / <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> activity of the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> of ~ 6 kbp isolated from the <termsem="SO:0001416"> 5 ' flanking regions </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000336"> PS </term> were <termsem="SO:0000049"> transferred </term> into luciferase reporter <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> .
We introduced the reporter <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> into undifferentiated ES cells ( open columns ) , retinoic acid-treated ES cells ( grey columns ) , and NIH3T3 cells ( closed columns ) .
Data represent the averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments .
We also found that the two <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> contained another ESG1-like <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> ( Figure 2A ) .
The two <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> , separated by a 68 kbp <termsem="SO:0000605"> intergenic sequence </term> , were oriented in opposite directions .
The ESG1-like <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> exhibited greater than 95 % identity to the <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> and <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> of the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
This <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> , however , contained critical <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitutions </term> in all of the <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> and one <termsem="SO:1000034"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> insertion </term> in <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 2 ( Figure 2B ) .
Although 675 <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001417"> 3 ' flanking regions </term> were <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> between the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and the <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> , only five <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001416"> 5 ' flanking region </term> were identical .
This <termsem="SO:0001416"> 5 ' flanking region </term> ( ~ 6 kbp ) did not possess any <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> / <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> activity in luciferase reporter assays ( Figure 3 ) .
It is thus unlikely that this <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is transcribed or translated into a functional protein .
This <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> likely represents a <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> .
Bierbaum previously reported the existence of two <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> with similar <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> - <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> organization as the ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 17 ] .
We could not determine which of these two <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> corresponds to the one we identified or the <termsem="SO:0000001"> location </term> of the remaining <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> .
Targeted disruption of the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
To study the function of ESG1 , we <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells .
We <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaced </term> the three <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> with either a fusion of the neomycin-resistance and -galactosidase genes ( -geo ) or the hygromycin resistant <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( HygR ) using two targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vectors </term> ( Figure 4A ) introduced into RF8 ES cells by electroporation .
We obtained eight ES cell clones with correct homologous recombination of the -geo targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis ( Figure 4B ) .
We obtained only one clone with correct homologous recombination of the HygR targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> .
Targeted disruption of the mouse ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
A ) Targeting strategy .
Homologous regions are indicated by thick lines .
<termsem="SO:0000409"> Recognition sites </term> of PstI ( P ) and SpeI ( S ) , which were used for Southern blot analyses , are shown .
The <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encoding diphtheria toxin A ( DTA ) was <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> at the 3 ' end of the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vectors </term> to facilitate negative selection .
B ) Southern blot analyses confirming homologous recombination .
<termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> WT </term> </term> , <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ES cells ;  , -geo <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cells ; H , HygR <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cells ; - / - , ESG1-null ES cells .
Numbers indicate clone numbers .
C ) Northern blot ( upper ) and western blot ( lower ) analyses of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ES cells ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> WT </term> </term> ) , ESG1-null ES cells ( - / - , three clones ) and heterozygous ES cells ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ) .
Northern blot was performed as previously described [ 20 ] .
To confirm the loading of equal amounts of <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> , ethidium bromide staining of <termsem="SO:0000252"> ribosomal RNA </term> is also shown ( middle ) .
To obtain homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> ES cells , we introduced the -geo <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> into HygR heterozygous ES cells .
Of 105 G418-resistant colonies tested , 49 were homozygous for ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> .
Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of ESG1 in these cells ( Figure 4C ) .
In 29 clones , the -geo <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> had <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaced </term> the HygR <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , such that the cells remained heterozygous .
In the remaining 27 clones , the -geo <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> was <termsem="SO:0000046"> integrated </term> at non-homologous sites .
ESG1 - / - ES cells exhibited normal morphology ( Figure 5A ) .
These cells also proliferated at a speed comparable to that of the control ( heterozygous and <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ) cells ( Figure 5B ) .
ESG1 - / - cells differentiated normally after the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor ( Figure 5B ) or retinoic acid treatment ( not shown ) .
When transplanted into hind flanks of nude mice , these cells produced teratomas , tumors containing components of all three germ layers ( Figure 5C ) .
These results indicate that ESG1 is dispensable for the self-renewal properties and pluripotency of ES cells .
Analyses of ESG1-null ES cells .
A ) The morphology of ESG1-null ES cell colonies grown on STO feeder cells .
B ) Growth curve of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> ) , ESG1-null ( - / - ) and heterozygous ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ) ES cells .
Each clone ( 1  104 cells/well ) was plated in 24-well plates .
Cell numbers were determined with a Coulter counter at 2 , 4 , and 6 days .
Data of <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - and - / - cells are shown as averages and standard deviations of three independent clones .
C ) A section of teratoma derived from ESG1-null ES cells ( hematoxylin & eosin staining ) .
We examined the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression profiles of ESG1 - / - ES cells using <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> - based <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> microarrays representing ~ 20,000 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
In comparison to control ES cells , ESG1 was identified as the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> reduced to the greatest extent in ESG1 - / - ES cells ( Figure 6A ) .
The expression of ES cell marker <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , such as Nanog and Oct3/4 , was normal in ESG1 - / - ES cells .
We confirmed normal Oct3/4 expression at protein levels by Western blot ( Figure 6B ) .
The overall <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression profiles were similar between control ES cells and ESG1 - / - ES cells .
Several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> exhibited a greater than two-fold reduction in ESG1 - / - cells , including Krt1-8 , Pem , Ctgf , Ptgs2 , Igf2 and Inhba .
These <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> might be regulated directly or indirectly by ESG1 .
Since ESG1 contains a KH-type <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> - binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , it may stabilize <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Further studied are required to clarify this possibility .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> expression analyses of ESG1-null ES cells .
A ) <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> microarray analyses .
Total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> from <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ES cells and ESG1-null ES cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 , respectively .
Samples were hybridized to Agilent Mouse Developmental Microarrays .
The averages of two independent clones are shown .
B ) Western blot analyses .
Cell lysates from ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - and ESG1 - / - cells were examined for expression of ESG1 , Oct3/4 and CDK4 with immunoblotting .
To generate ESG1-knockout mice , we injected -geo-ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cell clones into the blastocysts of C57BL6 mice .
We obtained germline transmission from three clones .
We obtained ESG1 - / - mice at the Mendelian ratios ( 36 <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> , 69 ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - , and 45 ESG1 - / - ) from intercrosses of ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - mice .
These animals exhibited normal development , gross appearance , and fertility ( not shown ) .
Histological examination of testis and ovary could not identify any abnormalities ( not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that ESG1 is dispensable for both mouse development and germ cell formation .
We also generated ES cells from blastocysts obtained by intercrosses of ESG1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - males and ESG1 - / - females .
Of the eight ES cell lines established , two clones were ESG1 - / - .
These ESG1-null ES cells demonstrated normal morphology , proliferation , and differentiation ( not shown ) , confirming that ESG1 is dispensable in ES cells .
To analyze the physiological roles of ESG1 , we identified the mouse <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 9 and <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> it by homologous recombination in ES cells .
Despite specific expression in early embryos , germ cells , and pluripotent cells , our data demonstrated that ESG1 is dispensable for mouse development , germ cell formation , and ES cell self-renewal .
