Identification and targeted disruption of the mouse gene encoding ESG1 ( PH34/ECAT2/DPPA5 ) .
Embryonic stem cell-specific gene ( ESG ) 1 , which encodes a KH-domain containing protein , is specifically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in early embryos , germ cells , and embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
Previous studies identified genomic clones containing the mouse ESG1 gene and five pseudogenes .
However , their chromosomal localizations or physiological functions have not been determined .
A Blast search of mouse genomic databases failed to locate the ESG1 gene .
We identified several bacterial artificial clones containing the mouse ESG1 gene and an additional ESG1-like sequence with a similar gene structure from chromosome 9 .
The ESG1-like sequence contained a multiple critical mutations , indicating that it was a duplicated pseudogene .
The 5 ' flanking region of the ESG1 gene , but not that of the pseudogene , exhibited strong enhancer and promoter activity in undifferentiated ES cells by <termsem="GO:0045289"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> luciferase </term> </term> reporter assay .
To study the physiological functions of the ESG1 gene , we replaced this sequence in ES cells with a -geo cassette by homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
Despite specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in early embryos and germ cells , ESG1 - / - mice <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> normally and were fertile .
We also <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> ESG1 - / - ES cells both by a second independent homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> and directly from blastocysts derived from heterozygous intercrosses .
Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of ESG1 in these cells .
These ES cells demonstrated normal morphology , <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
The mouse ESG1 gene , together with a duplicated pseudogene , is located on chromosome 9 .
Despite its specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in pluripotent cells and germ cells , ESG1 is dispensable for self-renewal of ES cells and <termsem="GO:0007281"> establishment of germcells </term> .
Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were first derived from the blastocysts of mice in 1981 [ 1,2 ] and humans in 1998 [ 3 ] .
ES cells have two important properties : theability to maintain pluripotency , which is the ability to <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> into a wide variety of cells , and rapid <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> .
These characteristics make mouse ES cells an essential component of gene targeting technology .
These qualitiesalso make human ES cells attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy to treat various diseases , including spinal cord injuries and juvenile diabetes .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the pluripotency and rapid proliferation of ES cells are currently a major focus of the field of stem cell biology [ 4-6 ] .
To identify molecules essential in ES cells for these properties , several groups have utilized transcriptome analyses to identify genes specifically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in ES cells and early embryos .
These analyses , including DNA microarray analyses [ 7 ] and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> sequence tag analyses [ 8-12 ] , identified several common transcripts , including ESG1 that was also designated dppa5 or ECAT2 .
ESG1 was originally identified as a transcript Ph34 that was <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> by retinoic acid in embryonic carcinoma cells [ 13 ] .
The expression of this gene was confined in mice to early embryos and germ cells [ 14 ] .
It is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in pluripotent cells , including ES cells , embryonic germ cells , and multipotent germline stem cells [ 15 ] .
ESG1 encodes a polypeptide of 118 amino acids that contains a single KH domain , which is an <termsem="GO:0003723"> RNA-binding </term> domain [ 16 ] .
It remains unclear , however , if ESG1 functions as an <termsem="GO:0003723"> RNA-binding </term> protein or the roles it plays in ES cells and mice .
Previous genomic library screening by identified genomic clones containing the mouse ESG1 gene and seven pseudogenes [ 17 ] .
Two of these pseudogenes exhibit a similar exon-intron structure as the ESG1 gene , indicating their <termsem="GO:0009058"> generation </term> by gene duplication .
The five remaining pseudogenes did not contain any introns , indicating that these were <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> by retrotransposition of ESG1 transcripts .
The chromosomal localizations of the mouse ESG1 gene and pseudogenes , however , have not been reported .
In this study , we determined the structure of the mouse gene encoding this protein and related pseudogenes .
We also performed gene targeting to determine the physiological function of ESG1 .
Chromosomal localization and structures of mouse ESG1 gene and psedogenes .
To determine the chromosomal localizations of the mouse ESG1 gene and pseudogenes , we performed a Blast analysis of the mouse genomic database with the ESG1 cDNA sequence as a query .
We identified several putative pseudogenes without introns on chromosomes 1 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 17 , and X ( Figure 1 ) .
In addition , two intron-less pseudogenes were identified in DNA fragments for which the chromosomal localization remained unmapped .
While these pseudodgenes have significant homology to ESG1 cDNA , they could not <termsem="GO:0009058"> produce </term> functional proteins , because of critical mutations .
This result suggests that there are a larger number of intron-less pseudogenes than previously anticipated .
Existence of multiple retropseudogenes is a hallmark of pluripotent cell-specific genes [ 18 ] .
ESG1pseudogenes identified by a Blast search of mouse genomic databases .
Substitution mutations are indicated by black lines .
Intron-like gap sequences are indicated with triangles .
Chromosomal localizations are shown on the right .
On chromosome 9 , we identified a DNA fragment similar to the ESG1 gene that included two putative introns .
These putative first and second exons , however , contained ( 4 ) multiple mutations of the ESG1 cDNA sequence .
The putative third exon was identical to that of the previously reported ESG1 gene .
Also on chromosome 9 , we identified another DNA fragment that was similar , but not identical , to the third exon of the ESG1 gene .
These findings suggest that these ESG1-like sequences on chromosome 9 have not been correctly assembled .
To obtain DNA fragments containing the ESG1 gene , we screened the bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) DNA pool by PCR using primer pairs that would only amplify the real gene , not the pseudogenes .
We obtained two independent , but overlapping BAC clones .
Southern blot analyses and sequencing demonstrated that these clones contained a sequence exhibiting complete identity with ESG1 cDNA that was interrupted by two putative introns ( Figure 2A ) .
The two intron sequences begin with GT and terminate with AG , fulfilling the GT-AG rule of exon-intron junctions [ 19 ] .
The 5 ' flanking region of this DNA fragment exhibited strong promoter/enhancer activity by <termsem="GO:0045289"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> luciferase </term> </term> reporter assays in undifferentiated ES cells , but not in somatic cells ( Figure 3 ) .
The same fragment showed much weaker activity after <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by retinoic acid .
We concluded that this sequence is the ESG1 gene .
BAC clones containing the ESG1 gene and a duplication pseudogene ( PS ) .
A ) Localization of the gene and PS on chromosome 9 .
B ) Sequence comparison of the gene and PS revealed that these are homologous from eight base pairs upstream of the first exon to 675 bp downstream of the third exon .
Substitution mutations are indicated by black lines .
The insertion is indicated by an open triangle .
Promoter/enhancer activity of the ESG1 gene and pseudogene .
DNA fragments of ~ 6 kbp isolated from the 5 ' flanking regions of the gene and PS were transferred into <termsem="GO:0045289"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> luciferase </term> </term> reporter plasmids .
We introduced the reporter genes into undifferentiated ES cells ( open columns ) , retinoic acid-treated ES cells ( grey columns ) , and NIH3T3 cells ( closed columns ) .
Data represent the averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments .
We also found that the two BAC clones contained another ESG1-like sequence ( Figure 2A ) .
The two sequences , separated by a 68 kbp intergenic sequence , were oriented in opposite directions .
The ESG1-like sequence exhibited greater than 95 % identity to the exons and introns of the ESG1 gene .
This sequence , however , contained critical nucleotide substitutions in all of the exons and one nucleotide insertion in exon 2 ( Figure 2B ) .
Although 675 base pairs of the 3 ' flanking regions were conserved between the ESG1 gene and the pseudogene , only five base pairs of the 5 ' flanking region were identical .
This 5 ' flanking region ( ~ 6 kbp ) did not possess any promoter/enhancer activity in <termsem="GO:0045289"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> luciferase </term> </term> reporter assays ( Figure 3 ) .
It is thus unlikely that this sequence is <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcribed </term> or <termsem="GO:0006412"> translated </term> into a functional protein .
This sequence likely represents a duplication pseudogene .
Bierbaum previously reported the existence of two pseudogenes with similar exon-intron organization as the ESG1 gene [ 17 ] .
We could not determine which of these two pseudogenes corresponds to the one we identified or the location of the remaining pseudogene .
Targeted disruption of the mouse ESG1 gene .
To study the function of ESG1 , we deleted the gene by homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in mouse ES cells .
We replaced the three exons with either a fusion of the neomycin-resistance and <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> genes ( -geo ) or the hygromycin resistant gene ( HygR ) using two targeting vectors ( Figure 4A ) introduced into RF8 ES cells by electroporation .
We obtained eight ES cell clones with correct homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> of the -geo targeting vector , which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis ( Figure 4B ) .
We obtained only one clone with correct homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> of the HygR targeting vector .
Targeted disruption of the mouse ESG1 gene .
A ) Targeting strategy .
Homologous regions are indicated by thick lines .
Recognition sites of PstI ( P ) and SpeI ( S ) , which were used for Southern blot analyses , are shown .
The gene encoding diphtheria toxin A ( DTA ) was inserted at the 3 ' end of the targeting vectors to facilitate negative selection .
B ) Southern blot analyses confirming homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
WT , wild-type ES cells ;  , -geo + / - ES cells ; H , HygR + / - ES cells ; - / - , ESG1-null ES cells .
Numbers indicate clone numbers .
C ) Northern blot ( upper ) and western blot ( lower ) analyses of wild-type ES cells ( WT ) , ESG1-null ES cells ( - / - , three clones ) and heterozygous ES cells ( + / - ) .
Northern blot was performed as previously described [ 20 ] .
To confirm the loading of equal amounts of RNA , ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA is also shown ( middle ) .
To obtain homozygous mutant ES cells , we introduced the -geo vector into HygR heterozygous ES cells .
Of 105 G418-resistant colonies tested , 49 were homozygous for ESG1 deletion .
Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of ESG1 in these cells ( Figure 4C ) .
In 29 clones , the -geo vector had replaced the HygR vector , such that the cells remained heterozygous .
In the remaining 27 clones , the -geo vector was integrated at non-homologous sites .
ESG1 - / - ES cells exhibited normal morphology ( Figure 5A ) .
These cells also <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferated </term> at a speed comparable to that of the control ( heterozygous and wild-type ) cells ( Figure 5B ) .
ESG1 - / - cells <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> normally after the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor ( Figure 5B ) or retinoic acid treatment ( not shown ) .
When transplanted into hind flanks of nude mice , these cells <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> teratomas , tumors containing components of all three germ layers ( Figure 5C ) .
These results indicate that ESG1 is dispensable for the <termsem="GO:0017145"> self-renewal </term> properties and pluripotency of ES cells .
Analyses of ESG1-null ES cells .
A ) The morphology of ESG1-null ES cell colonies <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> on STO feeder cells .
B ) <termsem="GO:0040007"> Growth </term> curve of wild-type ( WT ) , ESG1-null ( - / - ) and heterozygous ( + / - ) ES cells .
Each clone ( 1  104 cells/well ) was plated in 24-well plates .
Cell numbers were determined with a Coulter counter at 2 , 4 , and 6 days .
Data of + / - and - / - cells are shown as averages and standard deviations of three independent clones .
C ) A section of teratoma derived from ESG1-null ES cells ( hematoxylin & eosin staining ) .
We examined the <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> profiles of ESG1 - / - ES cells using oligonucleotide-based DNA microarrays representing ~ 20,000 genes .
In comparison to control ES cells , ESG1 was identified as the gene reduced to the greatest extent in ESG1 - / - ES cells ( Figure 6A ) .
The expression of ES cell marker genes , such as Nanog and Oct3/4 , was normal in ESG1 - / - ES cells .
We confirmed normal Oct3/4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at protein levels by Western blot ( Figure 6B ) .
The overall <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> profiles were similar between control ES cells and ESG1 - / - ES cells .
Several genes exhibited a greater than two-fold reduction in ESG1 - / - cells , including Krt1-8 , Pem , Ctgf , Ptgs2 , Igf2 and Inhba .
These genes might be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> directly or indirectly by ESG1 .
Since ESG1 contains a KH-type <termsem="GO:0003723"> RNA-binding </term> domain , it may <termsem="GO:0043489"> stabilize </term> mRNA of these genes .
Further studied are required to clarify this possibility .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Gene expression </term> analyses of ESG1-null ES cells .
A ) DNA microarray analyses .
Total RNA from wild-type ES cells and ESG1-null ES cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 , respectively .
Samples were <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> to Agilent Mouse <termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmental </term> Microarrays .
The averages of two independent clones are shown .
B ) Western blot analyses .
Cell lysates from ESG1 + / - and ESG1 - / - cells were examined for <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ESG1 , Oct3/4 and CDK4 with immunoblotting .
To <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> ESG1-knockout mice , we injected -geo-ESG1 + / - ES cell clones into the blastocysts of C57BL6 mice .
We obtained germline transmission from three clones .
We obtained ESG1 - / - mice at the Mendelian ratios ( 36 wild-type , 69 ESG1 + / - , and 45 ESG1 - / - ) from intercrosses of ESG1 + / - mice .
These animals exhibited normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , gross appearance , and fertility ( not shown ) .
Histological examination of testis and ovary could not identify any abnormalities ( not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that ESG1 is dispensable for both mouse <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and <termsem="GO:0007281"> germ cell formation </term> .
We also <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> ES cells from blastocysts obtained by intercrosses of ESG1 + / - males and ESG1 - / - females .
Of the eight ES cell lines <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> , two clones were ESG1 - / - .
These ESG1-null ES cells demonstrated normal morphology , <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( not shown ) , confirming that ESG1 is dispensable in ES cells .
To analyze the physiological roles of ESG1 , we identified the mouse gene on chromosome 9 and deleted it by homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in ES cells .
Despite specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in early embryos , germ cells , and pluripotent cells , our data demonstrated that ESG1 is dispensable for mouse <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , <termsem="GO:0007281"> germ cell formation </term> , and ES <termsem="GO:0017145"> cell self-renewal </term> .
Identification and analyses of BAC clones containing the mouse ESG1 gene .
To identify bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) clones containing mouse ESG1 gene , we performed PCR-based screening of mouse BAC library DNA pools ( Research Genetics ) using the pH34-u38 ( 5 ' - GAAGTCTGGTTCCTTGGCAGG-3 ' ) and pH34-L394 ( 5 ' - ACTCGATACACTGGCCTAGC-3 ' ) primers .
Following <termsem="GO:0015666"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> restriction enzyme </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0009056"> digestion </term> , we performed Southern blot analyses of BAC clones as described [ 20 ] using the pH34-U258 ( 5 ' - CTCGAGTGTACAGTCAAGTGGTTGCTGGGA-3 ' ) , pH34-U65 ( 5 ' - GTGACCCTCGTGACCCGTAA-3 ' ) , pH34-intron1L ( 5 ' - CTGCGTGAGAGAAACACCAAACAGGC-3 ' ) , pH34-L545 ( 5 ' - TGTGAATGGGAAGGTTACCACTCT-3 ' ) and pH34-SCL1 ( 5 ' - GCCCTCTTCTGGTTTGTCTCGAAAT-3 ' ) probes .
<termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> Hybridization </term> </term> with these probes revealed bands containing either the ESG1 gene or pseudogenes .
To sequence the region containing the mouse ESG1 gene and the 3 ' flanking region , we subcloned a ~ 15 kbp XhoI-SalI fragment into the pZERO-2 vector ( Invitrogen ) .
HindIII - or EcoRI - <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> fragments of this vector were then cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) for sequencing .
To sequence the ESG1 pseudogene and the 3 ' flanking region , an 8 kbp NotI/XhoI fragment was cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) .
BamHI - or PstI - fragments of this vector were also cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) .
To identify the sequence containing the 5 ' flanking regions of the ESG1 gene and the related pseudogenes , we used a TOPO walker kit ( Invitrogen ) with the pH34-T2L ( 5 ' - ACTAGTCGCAGCAGGGATCCAGGAATATCT-3 ' ) and pH34-L394 primers .
The resulting sequence was cloned into pCR2 .1 ( Invitrogen ) .
We obtained a ~ 6 kbp band from the NsiI - <termsem="GO:0009056"> digensted </term> library ; XbaI - , SpeI - , EcoRI - , and PstI - <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> fragments of this band were cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) for sequencing .
This fragment contained the 5 ' flanking region of the ESG1 gene .
A ~ 3 kbp fragment , obtained from the SacI - <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> library , was cloned into pCR2 .1 for sequencing .
This fragment was contained the 5 ' region flanking the pseudogene .
<termsem="GO:0009058"> Construction </term> of ESG1 targeting vectors .
We replaced all of the ESG1 exons with two targeting vectors containing either an IRES--geo cassette [ 21 ] or an IRES-HygR cassette by promoter trap selection .
We amplified the 5 ' arm ( 1.8 kbp ) using KOD plus ( TOYOBO ) with the pH34-targetpair5-U ( 5 ' - CCGCGGAAAGTCAAGAGATTGGGTGG-3 ' ) and pH34-targetpair5-L ( 5 ' - GCGGCCGCCTTTACGGGTCACGAGGGTCAC-3 ' ) primers .
The 3 ' arm ( 5.8 kbp ) was amplified using the pH34-targetpair3-U ( 5 ' - TGTGGCCAGTGTTTGGTTCTGGCGGG-3 ' ) and pH34-targetpair3-L ( 5 ' - CTCGAGGACTCGCCATTCTAGCCAAG-3 ' ) primers .
The IRES -geo or IRES HygR cassettes were <termsem="GO:0006266"> ligated </term> in between the two PCR fragments .
The diphtheria toxin A cassette was placed downstream of the 3 ' arm .
After linearization with SacII , these targeting vectors were electroporated into 2.0  107 RF8 ES cells [ 22 ] using a Gene pulser ( BIORAD ) .
<termsem="GO:0009294"> Transfected </term> cells were selected with 250 g/mL G418 or 100 g/mL hygromycin B , respectively .
Genomic DNA from G418 - or hygromycin B-resistant colonies was screened for homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> by Southern blotting .
Southern blot screening for homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
ES cells genomic DNA was extracted with PUREGENE  <termsem="GO:0019835"> Cell Lysis </term> Solution ( Gentra systems ) .
For 5 ' Southern blot analysis , genomic DNA was first <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> with PstI , then separated on an 0.8 % agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane as described [ 20 ] .
A 560 bp 5 ' probe was amplified using the ESG1S5 ( 5 ' - GATGGTGGTGGTGACTCAGAG -3 ' ) and ESG1AS5 as ( 5 ' - CCTCCATTGCCTCTATATCAG -3 ' ) primers .
The probe specifically labeled an 18 kbp band from the wild-type locus , a 15 kbp band from the -geo locus , and a 12 kbp band from the HygR locus .
Genomic DNA was also <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> with SpeI for 3 ' Southern blot analysis .
A 1,010 bp 3 ' probe was amplified with the pH34U-8000 ( 5 ' - CCAACCAGCCAGAGTTTCAGTTAT -3 ' ) and pH34L-9000 ( 5 ' - GATAAGCTGCTGCCAAAAGACAAG -3 ' ) primers .
The probe <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> to an 11.5 kbp band from the wild-type locus , a 12.5 kbp band from the -geo locus , and a 9.5 kbp band from the HygR locus .
Generation of anti-ESG1 polyclonal antibodies .
The coding sequence of Esg1 was amplified by PCR with the pH34-gw-s ( 5 ' - AAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGATGGTGACCCTCGTGA-3 ' ) and pH34-gw-as ( 5 ' - AGAAAGCTGGGTCTGCATCCAGGTCGGAGACA-3 ' ) primers .
To <termsem="GO:0009058"> construct </term> pDONR-pH34 , the resulting PCR product was subcloned into pDONR201 ( Invitrogen ) .
pDONR-pH34 was interacted with pDEST17 ( Invitrogen ) by LR <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
After <termsem="GO:0009294"> introduction </term> of the resulting <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> vector pDEST17-pH34 into BL21-AI E. coli ( Invitrogen ) , <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> <termsem="GO:0006412"> protein production </term> was induced according to the manufacture 's protocol .
Histidine-tagged ESG1 was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose ( Qiagen ) under <termsem="GO:0030164"> denaturing </term> conditions in the presence of 8 M urea .
After dialysis against 6 M urea , the <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> proteins were injected into New Zealand White rabbits to <termsem="GO:0009058"> generate </term> anti-ESG1 polyclonal antibodies .
After preparation of ES cell extracts with M-Per ( Pierce ) , cellular proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -14 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Millipore ) .
Membranes were incubated with anti-ESG1 ( 1/500 dilution ) , anti-Oct3 / 4 ( 1/500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti-CDK4 ( 1/200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and anti-GFP ( 1/1000 ; MBL ) primary antibodies .
Horseradish <termsem="GO:0004601"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> peroxidase </term> </term> - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins ( 1/5000 ; Cell <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> ) were used to detect <termsem="GO:0019865"> antibody binding </term> .
We visualized <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> antibody with an ECL Western Blotting Detection System ( Amersham ) .
Derivation of ESG1-deficient ES cells from blastocysts .
Esg1 + / - or ESG1 - / - mutant female mice were injected with Tamoxifen ( 10 g ) and Depo-provera ( 1 mg ) subcutaneously on the third day of <termsem="GO:0007565"> pregnancy </term> .
Four days later , embryos in diapause were flushed out of the uterus and cultured on STO feeder cells in four-well plates in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 20 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( Hyclone ) , 0.1 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids ( Invitrogen ) , 2 mM L-glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomysin ( Invitrogen ) , and 0.11 mM 2-mercaptoethanol ( Invitrogen ) .
After six days , the central mass of each explant was harvested , rinsed in PBS , and placed in a drop of <termsem="GO:0004295"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> trypsin </term> </term> for a few minutes .
The cell mass was collected with a finely drawn-out Pasteur pipette preloaded with medium , ensuring minimal carryover of the <termsem="GO:0004295"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> trypsin </term> </term> .
The cells were gently transfered into a fresh well with 20 % FBS-containing medium .
The resulting primary ES cell colonies were individually passaged into wells of four-well plates containing STO feeder cell layers .
Thereafter , cells were expanded by trypsinization of the entire culture .
Total RNA from wild-type ES cells and ESG1 - / - ES cells was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 , respectively .
