Deficits in spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination in ADAM11-deficient mice .
ADAM11 is a member of the ADAM gene family and is mainly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the nervous system .
It is thought to be an <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> molecule , since it has a disintegrin-like domain related to cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions .
To elucidate the physiological functions of ADAM11 , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> ADAM11-deficient mice by means of gene targeting .
ADAM11-deficient mice were apparently normal , and survived more than one year with no major histological abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord .
Because ADAM11 is highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the hippocampus and cerebellum , we have examined ADAM11 mutant mice for <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> using <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual </term> and hidden water maze tasks , and their <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination using a rotating rod task .
Our results showed that their <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual </term> water maze task results are normal , but the hidden water maze and rotating rod task skills are impaired in ADAM11-deficient mice .
Our results indicate that ADAM11 mutation does not affect <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> and differentiation during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , but affects <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination .
Thus , ADAM11 might play an important <termsem="GO:0007165"> signalling </term> or structural role as a <termsem="GO:0007155"> cell adhesion </term> molecule at the synapse , and may thus participate in synaptic <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> underlying <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioural </term> changes .
The ADAM ( A Disintegrin And <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Metalloprotease </term> </term> ) family comprises membrane-spanning multi-domain proteins containing a <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteinase </term> </term> - like domain and a disintegrin-like domain .
Approximately half of the ADAMs are catalytically active <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteases </term> </term> that shed a broad range of substrates , such as <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factors </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> molecules [ 1,2 ] .
Recent gene-disruption studies in mice have disclosed a physiological role of each ADAM .
For example , ADAM10 , ADAM17 and ADAM19 are critical for normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> by providing <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> signals at the correct times and places [ 3-6 ] .
In contrast , the functions of ADAM8 , ADAM9 , ADAM12 and ADAM15 are not essential for <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , suggesting a possible functional redundancy with other <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> [ 7-10 ] .
The remaining half , which are non - <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> - ADAMs , are thought to be <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> molecules .
More than ten ADAMs have been shown to support <termsem="GO:0033627"> integrin-mediated cell adhesion </term> in vitro [ 11 ] .
More recently , the finding has been reported that integrin-mediated <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> of tissue culture cells can be <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> by distinct ADAMs [ 12 ] .
In C. elegans , unc-71 gene coding a non - <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> - ADAM protein have been shown to be involved in <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration events </term> in vivo [ 13 ] .
However , the physiological roles of mammalian non - <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> - ADAMs are poorly understood in vivo .
Genetic deletion studies in mice have shown that both Adam2-null and Adam3-null male mutants are infertile and their spermatozoa lack egg - <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> abilities [ 14-16 ] .
The precise mechanism is under investigation [ 17 ] .
We have reported the findings of ADAM11 , ADAM22 and ADAM23 genes and their restricted <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the human and murine nervous systems [ 18,19 ] .
These ADAMs lack a catalytic motif critical for the <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteinase </term> </term> activity , suggesting that they are not <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> proteases </term> </term> .
We assume that these ADAMs might contribute to <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> , differentiation and survival or synaptic <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> by <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to integrins , cell-surface proteins or <termsem="GO:0007242"> intracellular signalling </term> molecules [ 20,21 ] .
We have reported severe ataxia , seizures , and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> before weaning , accompanied with hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system in Adam22-null mutant mice [ 22 ] .
It has been reported that the disruption of Adam23 gene in the mouse results in premature <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> associated with ataxia and tremor [ 23 ] .
Is spite of such extreme phenotypes , no histological defects in the brain has been observed in either Adam22-null nor Adam23-null mice .
ADAM11 is the closest paralog of ADAM22 and ADAM23 , and its orthologs have been found in vertebrates , but not in invertebrates .
It has been reported that the Xenopus ADAM11 ortholog , xMDC11a , has an <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern associated with <termsem="GO:0007399"> neural development </term> , with a proposed role in <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> [ 24 ] ; and it has been reported in analyses using Northern blot and in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridisation </term> </term> methods that the murine Adam11 gene is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in both the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> and adult nervous system [ 19,25 ] .
These findings led us to hypothesise that ADAM11 is an <termsem="GO:0005178"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> integrin binder </term> </term> that plays an important role in the nervous system , as do ADAM22 and ADAM23 .
To determine the physiological functions of ADAM11 , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> and analysed Adam11 gene-targeted mice .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of ADAM11-deficient mice .
Mice carrying a targeted mutation in their Adam11 gene were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> ( Fig. 1A ) .
Correct targeting events were confirmed by Southern blot analysis ( Fig. 1B ) .
As a result of this procedure , since a <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> termination </term> </term> codon was introduced in exon 5 in the pro-protein domain , only the truncated form of the ADAM11 protein would be <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesised </term> from this targeted allele .
Because pro-protein domains are always removed in mature functional ADAM-proteins by <termsem="GO:0004276"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> furin </term> </term> - like <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> proteases </term> </term> and are thus thought to be non-functional , we concluded that this truncated form of ADAM11 protein would have no function [ 26 ] .
Absence of mature ADAM11 protein in homozygous mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody that recognises the ADAM11 protein ( Fig. 1C ) .
Analysis by Western blot showed that heterozygous mutants <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> approximately half of the wild-type levels of ADAM11 protein .
ADAM11-deficient mice are viable and appear normal .
<termsem="GO:0007618"> Mating </term> of mice heterozygous for the ADAM11 mutation yielded a near-Mendelian distribution of genotypes in the offspring and the ratio of females and males was the same in all groups ( data not shown ) .
For the present experiments , ADAM11-deficient male mice ( backcrossed generations into C57BL/6NCrj , n = 14 ) were used in all <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioural </term> analyses and anatomical-histological studies .
Homozygous ADAM11-deficient mice were viable and appeared normal , indicating that the Adam11 gene is not essential to <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and survival .
The gain in body weight of ( - / - ) mice was comparable to that of ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice at least until 24 weeks of age ( data not shown ) .
There was no significant difference in <termsem="GO:0040011"> locomotor activity </term> among ( + / + ) , ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) genotypes ( data not shown ) .
No apparent anatomical-histological change was observed in the spinal cord , heart , lung , liver , kidney , spleen , testis or ovary ( data not shown ) .
The brain of ( - / - ) mice , including the hippocampus ( Fig. 1D ) and cerebellum ( Fig. 1E ) appeared normal after HE staining when ( + / + ) , ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) mice were compared .
Since Adam11 is predominantly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the hippocampus and cerebellum , we applied hippocampus - or cerebellum-dependent <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioural </term> analyses .
Spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> in ADAM11-deficient mice .
To study the functions of ADAM11 in the hippocampus , we examined the spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> ability of ADAM11-deficient mice using the Morris Water Maze task [ 27 ] .
First , mice were trained in a hidden platform task , in which mice searched for a submerged platform to escape from the water .
Adam11 ( - / - ) mice were found to take a significantly longer time to locate the hidden platform than ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice ( Fig. 2A ) .
Nonetheless , the ability of ( + / + ) , ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) mice to find the hidden platform improved over test sessions ( Fig. 2A ) .
Thus , ( + / + ) , ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) mice were able to <termsem="GO:0007612"> learn </term> the location of the hidden platform during the course of the trials , although the capacity of ( - / - ) mice to find the platform was lower than that of ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice .
We further performed a probe test , in which the platform was removed from the pool after completion of the hidden platform task , and the trained mice were allowed to swim freely for 60 sec .
The time spent in the target quadrant of ( - / - ) is significantly lower than that of ( + / + ) mice ( Fig. 2B ) .
Adam11 ( + / - ) mice appeared to spend a shorter time in the target quadrant , but there was no significant difference between ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice ( Fig. 2B ) .
These results indicate a spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> impairment in ( - / - ) mice .
The swimming distance of ( + / + ) , ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) mice , however , was similar during the probe trial ( Fig. 2C ) .
In the visible platform task , the performance of mice with ( + / + ) , ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) genotypes improved during the course of the test sessions , as indicated by a progressive decrease in the latency for locating the platform ( Fig. 2D ) , suggesting that ( - / - ) mice <termsem="GO:0007612"> learn </term> this visible platform task just as well as ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice .
These results also indicated that ( - / - ) mice have normal visible and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor function </term> and the motivation needed in the water maze task .
<termsem="GO:0050879"> Motor function </term> of ADAM11-deficient mice .
To study the functions of ADAM11 in the cerebellum , we examined the <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor function </term> of ADAM11-deficient mice using a rotating rod task [ 28 ] .
In the rotating rod test , the retention time of ( + / - ) and ( - / - ) mice on the rod was not significantly different from that of ( + / + ) mice at 0 rpm ( stationary ) [ + / - : F ( 1 , 80 ) = 1.67 , p = 0.21 ; - / - : F ( 1 , 88 ) = 0.002 , p = 0.96 ] ( Fig. 3A ) .
In ( + / - ) mice , the tendency of decreased retention times was seen at 5 , 10 and 15 rpm , but there was no significant difference between ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice [ 5 rpm : F ( 1 , 20 ) = 1.27 , p = 0.27 ; 10 rpm : F ( 1 , 20 ) = 1.07 , p = 0.31 ; 15 rpm : F ( 1 , 20 ) = 2.716 , p = 0.11 ] ( Figs. 3B , 3C and 3D ) .
However , ( - / - ) mice fell more quickly from the rod than ( + / + ) mice at 5 , 10 and 15 rpm [ 5 rpm : F ( 1 , 27.3 ) = 17.51 , p = 0.0002 ; 10 rpm : F ( 1 , 22 ) = 11.05 , p = 0.003 ; 15 rpm : F ( 1 , 22 ) = 19.22 , p = 0.0002 ] ( Figs. 3B , 3C and 3D ) .
The retention time was not significantly improved in ( - / - ) mice across trials of training at 5 , 10 and 15 rpm [ 5 rpm : F ( 3 , 15.3 ) = 2.05 , p = 0.15 ; 10 rpm : F ( 7 , 11 ) = 2.61 , p = 0.07 ; 15 rpm : F ( 19 , 26.6 ) = 1.57 , p = 0.14 ] ( Figs. 3B , 3C and 3D ) .
In a traction test , ( - / - ) mice showed a high grip strength similar to that of ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice ( Fig. 4 ) .
The hanging score and time of ( - / - ) mice were also similar to those of ( + / + ) and ( + / - ) mice ( Figs. 5A and 5B ) .
A footprint test did not reveal any abnormalities in walking patterns , including stride length and step width , as a function of genotypes ( Figs. 6A and 6B ) .
In the present study , we examined the function of ADAM11 by <termsem="GO:0000003"> generating </term> mice that lacked the Adam11 gene .
It has been reported that the Adam11 gene is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the brain , heart , liver and testis , as manifested in Northern blot analysis [ 19 ] .
Interestingly , ADAM11-deficient mice appeared normal and survived more than one year without apparent histological abnormality , including the brain , heart , liver and testis .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns of the Adam11 gene in the brain have been studied using in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridisation </term> </term> [ 25 ] .
This study has shown high <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ADAM11 mRNA in the hippocampus and cerebellum .
We therefore focused on examining the hippocampus - and cerebellum-dependent <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioural </term> tests to study the functions of ADAM11 in the nervous system .
It is widely accepted that the hippocampus is involved in the performance of the hidden platform version of the water maze test , since lesions of the hippocampal pathways lead to a severe impairment of <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> in this task [ 29 ] .
In the hidden platform task , ADAM11-deficient mice needed more time to reach the platform than wild-type mice .
Spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> was also assessed using a probe trial , in which the platform was removed from the pool on the day following nine days of training .
The wild-type mice spent significantly more time searching for the platform in the target quadrant than the other quadrants .
However , ADAM11-deficient mice did not search selectively in the target quadrant .
On the other hand , in the visible platform version , in which the <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> ability and <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual </term> acuity of the mouse are tested , ADAM11-defieient mice were normal .
These results indicated that ADAM11-deficient mice showed a spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> impairment .
The cerebellum is in charge of the smooth coordination of somatic <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor activity </term> , <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of muscle tone , and mechanisms that influence and maintain equilibrium [ 30 ] .
It is widely accepted that the cerebellum is involved in the performance of the rotating rod task , since mice with structural abnormalities in the cerebellum [ 31 ] or with disruptions in genes enriched in the cerebellum [ 32 ] exhibit performance deficits in this task .
In the rotating rod test in this study , although the retention time of ADAM11-deficient mice on the rod was not different from wild-type mice at 0 rpm ( stationary ) , ADAM11-deficient mice fell more quickly from the rod than wild-type mice at 5 , 10 and 15 rpm .
These results indicate that ADAM11-deficient mice have a deficit in <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination .
On the other hand , in the <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual </term> platform version of the water maze task , <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> ability for swimming in ADAM11-deficient mice was normal .
These results suggested that there might be a different mechanism of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor function </term> between swimming and the rotating rod task .
It has been also reported that the cerebellum is involved in another important distinct function : <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> associated with component <termsem="GO:0050879"> movement </term> ( <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> ) [ 33 ] .
The retention time of synaptotagmin ( Syt ) IV-deficient mice on the rod was significantly shorter than wild-type mice , and they improved it approximately to the same rates as did wild-type mice during rotating rod performance [ 34 ] .
These data suggest the basis for the performance deficit on the rotating rod task in the Syt IV mutants is in <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination rather than in <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> .
The results in the present study showed that ADAM11-deficient mice slightly , though not significantly , improved <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> ability during rotating rod performance .
However , the deficit of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> in ADAM11-deficient mice was not clear in this study .
Because they could not ride on the rotating rod , they might not <termsem="GO:0007612"> learn </term> this task .
To examine <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> ability in ADAM11-deficient mice in detail , we will need to use other cerebellar-dependent <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> tasks , such as a classical eyelid conditioning test .
There was no impairment in the grip strength and wire suspension test in ADAM11-deficient mice .
Spontaneous <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor activity </term> and walking patterns of ADAM11-deficient mice were also found to be normal , suggesting that the dysfunction found in the rotating rod test was not derived from muscle weakness or other peripheral disturbances .
These results suggest that limited brain sites , mainly the hippocampus and cerebellum , might contribute to the dominant phenotype , spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> impairment and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> discoordination in ADAM11-deficient mice .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridisation </term> </term> analysis has detected Adam11 <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in the pyramidal cells of CA1 -- CA3 fields and granule cells of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and in granular cells in the cerebellum [ 25 ] .
It is unlikely that morphological changes during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> led to impairment of spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination , and morphological alterations in the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampus and cerebellum were not observed in ADAM11-deficient mice after histological investigation using HE staining .
However , because it is thought that ADAM11 plays a role in neuron-neuron or neuron-glial cell interactions , a more precise morphological investigation will be needed .
It has been reported that <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> molecules , such as <termsem="GO:0007158"> neural cell adhesion </term> molecule ( NCAM ) , are not only implicated in cell interactions during <termsem="GO:0007399"> nervous system development </term> , but are also recognised as important mediators of synaptic plasticity in the adult nervous system [ 35 ] .
Changes in neuron excitability in the hippocampus , such as decreases in the post-burst after <termsem="GO:0060081"> hyperpolarization </term> ( AHP ) , have been thought to affect long-term <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiation </term> ( LTP ) [ 36 ] , an experimental model of the synaptic changes thought to underlie <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0007613"> memory </term> [ 37 ] .
It has also been reported that mice lacking <termsem="GO:0004972"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> NMDA receptor </term> </term> for both NR2A and NR2C subunits showed <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> dysfunction and complete loss of both spontaneous and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) in cerebellar granule cells [ 38 ] .
Therefore , electrophyological studies to enable analysis of <termsem="GO:0007268"> synaptic transmission </term> and plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum of ADAM11-deficient mice will be needed .
These studies might clarify whether ADAM11 plays an important <termsem="GO:0007165"> signalling </term> or structural role at the synaptic level and whether it participates in synaptic <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> .
ADAM11-deficient mice remained alive for more than one year without ataxia or tremor , but showed a deficit in spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> dysfunction .
On the other hand , mice lacking the Adam22 gene showed severe ataxia , exhibited marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves , and <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> before weaning [ 22 ] .
Mice lacking the Adam23 gene showed severe ataxia and tremor and <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> before weaning [ 23 ] .
These findings suggest that ADAM11 , ADAM22 and ADAM23 have separate and important roles in the nervous system .
A genome database search revealed orthologs of ADAM11 , ADAM22 and ADAM23 genes to exist in vertebrates such as mammals , fish , and amphibians , but not in invertebrates .
Although the precise molecular functions of these ADAMs are still unclear , further investigations will provide clues to understanding the nervous system of higher organisms .
ADAM11-deficient mice survived more than one year without ataxia or tremor , showed no abnormalities in body weight gain , spontaneous <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor activity </term> , muscle strength , or walking patterns , and exhibited no apparent anatomical-histological changes .
However , hippocampus-dependent spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> and cerebellum-dependent <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> coordination in ADAM11-deficient mice were impaired when tested using water maze and rotating rod tasks .
Our genetically modified mouse strain has the potential to be a useful and sensitive tools for detailed investigation of ADAM proteins ' functions in the nervous system .
<termsem="GO:0009058"> Construction </term> of an Adam11 gene-targeting vector .
The 13.7-kb BamHI DNA fragment covering exons 2 -- 20 of the Adam11 gene was amplified from C57BL/6 genomic DNA by the PCR using Expand Hi-Fidelity polymerase mix ( Roche Diagnostics KK , Tokyo , Japan ) .
To generate a mutation in the mouse Adam11 gene , we inserted a PGKneo cassette into exons 5 -- 7 of the Adam11 gene .
The final targeting construct consisted of a 10.1-kb genomic DNA fragment that was interrupted by the insertion of the PGKneo cassette and contained a MC1 / <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> cassette as a negative selection marker against random integration [ 39 ] .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of Adam11 deficient mice .
The linearised targeting vector was electroporated into TT2 embryonic stem ( ES ) cells [ 40 ] .
Homologous recombinants were selected by PCR using the following primers , AGN1 : 5 ' - TCGTGCTTTACGGTATCGCCGCTCCCGATT-3 ' in the PGKneo cassette , and SGN033 : 5 ' - GGACCCGGAAGACATTTGCACGGT-3 ' outside the targeting vector .
Homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> DNA was efficiently amplified by 35 cycles of the following amplification steps ( 94 C -30 sec and 68 C -5 min ) .
Correctly targeted ES clones were injected into <termsem="GO:0009566"> fertilised </term> ICR mouse eggs at the eight-cell stage .
The resulting male chimeras were <termsem="GO:0007618"> mated </term> with C57BL/6NCrj females ( Charles River Japan , Tokyo , Japan ) , and resulting heterozygous ( + / - ) male and female mice were interbred to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> homozygous ( - / - ) mice .
Mouse genomic DNA used for Southern blot analysis was extracted from the liver of each genotype .
BamHI - <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> genomic DNA was probed with the [ 32P ] - labelled BE2K probe , which was a 2.0-kb BamHI -- EcoRI genomic fragment located in intron 2 .
The absence of ADAM11 protein in the ( - / - ) mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis .
To be brief , the cerebellum was isolated from a six month-old mouse of each genotype and homogenised in <termsem="GO:0019835"> cell lysis </term> buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % NP-40 , <termsem="GO:0030414"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> inhibitor </term> </term> cocktail [ Roche Diagnostics ] ) .
After removal of cell debris by centrifugation , the <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> proteins in the supernatant were concentrated by the affinity chromatography using Con A Sepharose 4B ( Amersham Biosciences Corp. ) .
Each sample was separated on 10 % SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a PVDF membrane .
The blot was then incubated with monoclonal antibody against the ADAM11 ( U. S. Patent 5,631,351 ) at 1 g/ml .
<termsem="GO:0005488"> Bound </term> antibodies were visualised with horseradish <termsem="GO:0004601"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> peroxidase </term> </term> - labelled second antibody and an ECL-plus chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Biosciences Corp. ) .
All animal procedures conformed to the Japanese regulations on animal care and use , following the Guideline for Animal Experimentation of the Japanese Association for Laboratory of Animal Science , and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Eisai Co. , Ltd. .
For the present experiments , ADAM11-deficient male mice ( backcrossed generations into C57BL/6NCrj , n = 14 ) were used in all <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioural </term> analyses ( 22 -- 24 weeks of age ) .
All of the <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioural </term> studies were conducted between 10:00 and 16:00 by a well-trained experimenter blind to the mouse genotypes .
Spontaneous <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor activity </term> .
<termsem="GO:0040011"> Locomotor activity </term> in a novel environment was measured by introducing mice ( + / + , + / - and - / - ; n = 8 , 8 and 8 , respectively ) for 90 min in a Plexiglas box ( 30  20  13 cm ) using a VERSAMAX equipment and software ( Accuscan , Columbus , OH , USA ) .
Spatial <termsem="GO:0007612"> learning </term> was assessed by three variants of the Morris water maze task [ 27 ] adapted for mice .
Hidden platform task : The pool was divided into four quadrants with four starting locations , called north , east , south and west , at equal distances to the rim .
A circular , transparent acrylic platform ( diameter 8 cm ) was submerged 1 cm below the surface of the water in the centre of the southeast quadrant for each trial of this task .
Each mouse was allowed to swim for 60 sec and the time required to reach the platform ( escape latency ) was recorded in each trial .
In total this task consisted of four trials per day over 9 days ( 1 min inter-trial intervals ) .
Each trial was initiated by randomly placing an animal in one of the four starting locations .
Probe trial : A single probe trial was carried out after the hidden platform task had been completed .
In this trial , the platform was removed and the <termsem="GO:0050879"> movement </term> of each mouse was monitored using a computer-based video tracking system ( BTA-2 ; Muromachi Kikai Co. , Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Each mouse was placed into the northwest quadrant of the pool and allowed to swim for 60 sec .
Swim path length and the time spent in the trained ( southeast ) quadrant were calculated .
Visible platform task : In this task , the circular platform was made visible by attaching a black board to it and the mouse was required to locate the visible platform .
The mouse was allowed to swim for 60 sec and this task consisted of four trials per day for three consecutive days ( 1 min inter-trial intervals ) .
Each trial was initiated by randomly placing an animal in one of the four starting locations .
<termsem="GO:0050879"> Motor </term> coordination was assessed with a rotating rod apparatus ( KN-75 , Natsume Seisakujo , Tokyo , Japan ) , which consisted of a plastic rod ( 3 cm diameter , 8 cm long ) with a gritted surface flanked by two large discs ( 40 cm diameter ) .
The mice were first placed on the stationary rod for 4 successive trials , followed by 4 trials at a rotation speed of 5 rpm , 8 trials at 10 rpm , and 20 trials at 15 rpm in that order .
Latency until a fall occurred was monitored for 120 sec .
Intra-trial intervals for each animal were more than 20 min .
The grip strength of each mouse was measured with a traction apparatus ( FU-1 , Muromachi Kikai Co. , Ltd. ) .
Each mouse was made to grasp the attached bar ( 2 mm diameter ) with the forepaws and was slowly pulled back by the tail .
The maximum tension before release was recorded .
A mouse was placed on a stainless bar ( 50 cm length , 2 mm diameter , elevated up to 37 cm from a surface ) at a point midway between the supports and observed for 30 sec in four separate trials .
The amount of time spent hanging was recorded and scored according to the following system [ 41 ] : 0 , fell off ; 1 , hung onto the bar with two forepaws ; 2 , in addition to 1 , attempted to climb onto the bar ; 3 , hung onto the bar with two forepaws and one or both hind paws ; 4 , hung onto the bar with all four paws with tail wrapped around the bar ; 5 , escaped to one of the supports .
Black ink was applied to the hind paws of each mouse and the mice were placed in a narrow alley ( 9  25  10 cm ) on white paper .
Stride length and step width were calculated .
Data are expressed as the means  SEM .
Statistical analysis was conducted using the software package SAS 8.1 ( SAS Institute Japan Ltd. , Tokyo , Japan ) .
Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by the Dunnett-type multiple comparison test , and p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant in the water maze task .
<termsem="GO:0007610"> Behavioural </term> data in the rotating rod test were analysed by one - or two-way ANOVA with repeated measures , and p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be significant .
Sections of tissues including the brain , spinal cord , heart , lung , liver , kidney , spleen and testis from mice ( + / + , + / - and - / - ; n = 7 , 7 and 7 , respectively ) were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin .
Each paraffin section of thick 4 m was stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) .
