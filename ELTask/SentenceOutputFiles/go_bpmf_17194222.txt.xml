Genetic Analysis of the Roles of BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 in Limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> Patterning </term> and <termsem="GO:0001501"> Skeletogenesis </term> .
Bone <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> protein ( BMP ) family members , including BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 , are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> .
BMPs have been implicated in early limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> as well as in the <termsem="GO:0001501"> process of skeletogenesis </term> .
However , due to complications associated with early embryonic lethality , particularly for Bmp2 and Bmp4 , and with functional redundancy among BMP molecules , it has been difficult to decipher the specific roles of these BMP molecules during different stages of <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> .
To circumvent these issues , we have <termsem="GO:0000003"> constructed </term> a series of mouse strains lacking one or more of these BMPs , using conditional alleles in the case of Bmp2 and Bmp4 to remove them specifically from the limb bud mesenchyme .
Contrary to earlier suggestions , our results indicate that BMPs neither act as secondary signals downstream of Sonic Hedghog ( SHH ) in <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> the anteroposterior axis nor as signals from the interdigital mesenchyme in <termsem="GO:0007389"> specifying </term> digit identity .
We do find that a threshold level of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is required for the onset of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> , and hence some <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> condensations fail to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 .
However , in the condensations that do <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> , subsequent <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> proceeds normally even in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 or BMP2 and BMP4 .
In contrast , we find that the loss of both BMP2 and BMP4 results in a severe impairment of <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> .
A group of related <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules called bone <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> proteins ( BMPs ) are known to play important roles in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the structures such as the limbs .
However , because different members of this group often have similar effects on target cells and are <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> in overlapping regions of the embryo and hence can be redundant with one another , removal of any single member of the BMP family may not reveal the full extent of the roles they play during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
We have therefore improved on this type of analysis by removing pairs of these factors ( BMP2 and BMP4 or BMP2 and BMP7 ) specifically from the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limb .
Although some have speculated that these signals play an early role in <termsem="GO:0048532"> organizing </term> or `` <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> '' the different tissues of the limb , we find no evidence for such a role .
We do find , however , that a minimal amount of BMP signal is required to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> cartilage , and hence some cartilaginous elements fail to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 .
Moreover , in the absence of these two BMP family members , there is a severe impairment in the <termsem="GO:0001503"> development of bone tissue </term> , resulting in severely deformed limbs .
This study gives important new insight into the roles of these BMP signals in <termsem="GO:0032502"> making </term> skeletal tissues in the embryo .
Bone <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> proteins ( BMPs ) are <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules belonging to the transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term>  superfamily , originally identified on the basis of their ability to <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> when implanted within soft tissue in vivo [ 1 -- 3 ] .
BMP family members are now known to play an extremely diverse set of roles in a wide variety of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental processes </term> [ 4 ] .
Even in the context of the <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> of a single structure , these molecules can play a series of quite divergent roles .
For example , during <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> , BMPs have been postulated to act sequentially in multiple distinct aspects of <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> , <termsem="GO:0001708"> cell type specification </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of various tissues , particularly of the skeleton .
The earliest step of <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> in which <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> has been implicated is the establishment of the anterior-posterior limb axis .
Differences in anterior-posterior pattern are instructed as a graded <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to Sonic Hedghog ( SHH ) signaling emanating from the posterior margin of the limb bud [ 5 ] .
It has remained controversial , however , whether this <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> is direct or indirect .
If indeed the long-range effects of SHH are indirectly mediated by local <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> of secondary signals , the leading candidates have been two members of the BMP family , BMP2 and BMP7 .
Both are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in a broader domain than SHH in the early posterior limb bud mesenchyme [ 6,7 ] , although BMP7 also has a second , weaker domain of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme .
BMP2 [ 8 ] and BMP7 [ 7 ] can be induced by ectopic SHH and their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is greatly diminished in the absence of SHH activity [ 9 ] .
BMP2 and BMP7 are thus secondary signals <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to SHH activity .
Moreover , <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> has a weak ability to <termsem="GO:0009949"> posteriorly polarize </term> the limb in ectopic grafting experiments [ 10 ] , an activity <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> by prior low-level exposure to SHH [ 11 ] .
It remains unclear , however , whether BMP2 and BMP7 activity is required endogenously for anterior-posterior limb patterning by SHH .
Bmp2 mutant embryos <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> too early to assess their limb phenotypes .
A targeted deletion of Bmp7 has been made , and Bmp7-deficient embryos display hindlimb polydactyly with incomplete penetrance but otherwise phenotypically normal limbs [ 12,13 ] .
Nonetheless , Bmp7 knockout mice do not show any defect in limb polarity .
However , a redundant function in <termsem="GO:0009948"> anterior-posterior patterning </term> with BMP2 remains a possibility .
In addition to BMP2 and BMP7 , a third member of this family that is closely related to BMP2 , BMP4 , is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the early limb bud .
Like BMP7 , it is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in both the anterior and posterior margins of the limb bud mesenchyme [ 4,14 ] ; however , it does not appear to be induced by SHH <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , nor does its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> change in SHH-deficient limb buds .
Thus , BMP4 is not a candidate for a secondary signal downstream of SHH in early <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> .
However , all three of these molecules , BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 , have been suggested to act in a second distinct phase of limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> , when digit identities are <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> downstream of earlier <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning events </term> .
In the vertebrate limb , each digit can be uniquely identified based on its size , length , number of phalanges , and location within the autopod .
As a consequence of the initial <termsem="GO:0009948"> establishment of anterior-posterior positioned information </term> within the limb by SHH and/or <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> , the interdigital mesenchyme of the hand plate becomes <termsem="GO:0007389"> specified </term> in a graded manner .
Grafting and extirpation experiments have shown that it is this <termsem="GO:0007164"> polarized </term> interdigital tissue which <termsem="GO:0065007"> directs </term> digit morphology [ 15 ] .
BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 are all <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the interdigital mesenchyme [ 4,14 ] , and experiments inhibiting <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> in this tissue suggested that differential levels of BMPs in the interdigital mesenchyme might be the relevant factor <termsem="GO:0065007"> directing </term> digit morphology [ 15 ] .
As noted above , BMP7-deficient embryos <termsem="GO:0032502"> produce </term> mostly normal limbs , and mice harboring a conditional deletion of Bmp4 in the limb bud mesenchyme also do not show evidence of anterior digit transformation [ 16 ] , as would have been predicted if BMP4 acted as an interdigital regulator of digit morphology .
In the light of these observations , it would seem unlikely that quantitative differences in levels of interdigital BMP signal are responsible for <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishing </term> digit identity , although redundancy between BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 in this role remains a possibility .
A third aspect of limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> in which BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 have been implicated is in the <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> death of the interdigital tissue .
For example , ectopic application of BMP antagonists demonstrates that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is necessary for this process , and in its absence , webbing occurs [ 17 -- 19 ] ) .
BMP activity also plays an indirect role in limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> as a key component of a feedback loop between SHH <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> in the posterior limb bud and fibroblast <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> in the overlying apical ectodermal ridge ( AER ) .
SHH activity leads to the <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of the BMP antagonist Gremlin in the mesenchyme [ 20,21 ] .
This , in turn , prevents BMPs from <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulating </term> fibroblast <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> ( FGF ) <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> in the AER [ 17,22 ] and maintains the integrity of the AER itself [ 23 ] .
<termsem="GO:0008543"> FGF signaling </term> feeds back to maintain SHH <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> in the posterior mesenchyme [ 8,24 ] .
Thus , conditional removal of BMP4 activity from the posterior limb mesenchyme results in a persistence of the AER , expanded SHH <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , and consequent preaxial and postaxial polydactyly [ 16 ] .
At later stages of <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> , BMP activity is also believed to play critical roles in <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> .
Activation and dominant-negative experiments in the chick have shown that signaling through the BMPR-IB <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> is necessary and sufficient for <termsem="GO:0001502"> cartilage condensation </term> in chick [ 25 ] .
Likewise , conditional knockout of BmpR1A and BmpR1B blocks all <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the mouse limb bud [ 26 ] .
Similarly , when noggin , a potent BMP inhibitor , is introduced in early stage chick limb buds prior to <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> , mesenchymal condensation does not take place [ 27,28 ] .
Taken together , these studies strongly implicate <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> as necessary for mesenchymal condensations and the initiation of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> .
However , the phenotypes in these experiments are severe , causing either global <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> or absence of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> , in the gain - and loss-of-function experiments , respectively .
These severe defects during the early stages of <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> preclude investigation of any specific roles for BMPs in later events in cartilage <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> , and bone <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolism </term> [ 29 ] .
Conversely , removal of individual ligands such as BMP4 [ 16 ] or BMP7 [ 12,13 ] has not displayed defects in skeletal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , presumably due to functional redundancy .
To gain further insights into the potential roles of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> in vertebrate limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> and <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> , we have <termsem="GO:0000003"> produced </term> mice simultaneously lacking BMP2 and BMP4 activity or BMP2 and BMP7 activity in the limb mesechyme during <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> .
Since Bmp2 and Bmp4 mutants are both <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> early in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> [ 30,31 ] , we used conditional alleles of both these genes .
The conditional alleles were deleted early in <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> through the action of a cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the Prx1 enhancer [ 32 ] .
Neither limbs deficient in BMP2 and BMP7 nor those deficient in BMP2 and BMP4 had defects suggestive of loss of <termsem="GO:0009948"> anterior-posterior patterning </term> information , arguing against these factors acting as secondary signals downstream of SHH or acting as interdigital determinants of digit identity .
The Bmp2/Bmp4 double mutants did display a loss of posterior digits with a broad posterior hand plate , suggestive of a block in the <termsem="GO:0001502"> <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> condensation </term> of the posterior digit rays , rather than a change in anterior-posterior digit identity .
At later stages , the combined activity of neither BMP2 and BMP4 nor of BMP2 and BMP7 is required for <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> .
<termsem="GO:0001503"> Osteogenesis </term> is also initiated properly in the absence of these pairs of factors .
However , at later stages , the combined loss of BMP2 and BMP4 evidently becomes limiting , and <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> ceases .
As all prior reported manipulations of the <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP pathway </term> during <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletal development </term> either result in a block at the first stage of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> or allow complete <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletal formation </term> , this is the first demonstration of a requirement for BMP activity in <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
To investigate the roles of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> at various stages of limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> and <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> constructed </term> a series of mice deficient singly or in combination in the ability to <termsem="GO:0000003"> produce </term> BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 .
BMP7-deficient mice ( kindly provided by Dr. Liz Robertson ) survive until <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
However , BMP2 and BMP4 are both required for viability early in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> [ 30,31 ] .
We therefore <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> a conditional allele of Bmp2 , introducing loxP sites flanking exon 3 .
We obtained a conditional allele of Bmp4 , in which exon 4 is flanked by loxP sites , from Dr. Holger Kulessa and Dr. Brigid Hogan [ 16 ] .
Both of these alleles would be expected to result in null alleles following <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> ( see Materials and Methods for details ) .
To conditionally inactivate Bmp2 and Bmp4 in the limb , we used a well-characterized transgene in which cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the Prx1 limb enhancer [ 32 ] .
This transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expresses </term> cre very early in <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> , resulting in complete <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> of floxed alleles at early limb bud stages .
We verified the ability of Prx1 : : cre to <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombine </term> the conditional Bmp2 and Bmp4 alleles at earliest limb bud stages using in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
Bmp2 is first <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the limb mesenchyme at embryonic day ( E ) 10.5 in the mouse ( Figure 1A , asterisk ) .
By the time its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is first detectable , the floxed Bmp2 allele appears to be completely <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> in the limb mesenchyme , as whole mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> does not detect any mesenchymal Bmp2 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> ( Figure 1B ) .
At E10 .5 Bmp4 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the mouse limb mesenchyme in two stripes at the anterior and posterior margins ( Figure 1C , red arrows ) .
These <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domains are completely lost by E10 .5 in the presence of the Prx1 : : cre transgene ( Figure 1D ) .
Bmp2 and Bmp4 are also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the AER , where Prx1 : : cre is inactive , and these domains of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> are not affected ( Figure 1A -- 1D , black arrows ) .
An Allelic/Nonallelic Series of BMP-Deficient Limbs .
Mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> with limbs deficient in BMP2 , BMP4 , or BMP7 , both BMP2 and BMP4 , or both BMP2 and BMP7 .
To obtain an initial indication of the range of phenotypes produced in these animals , we first examined the limb skeletons of newborn animals .
BMP2-deficient limbs appeared remarkably normal , both in skeletal pattern and in gross aspects of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> and <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> indicated by Alcian blue/Alizarin red staining .
The one notable defect in the appendicular skeleton of these animals is a characteristic malformation of the scapula ( Figure 1 , red arrow ) .
BMP2-deficient limbs also exhibit 3/4 soft-tissue syndactyly with variable penetrance ( Figure 2 ) .
Mice with limbs deficient in BMP4 activity and the limbs of Bmp7 mutant mice have both been previously described .
As reported [ 16 ] , in the absence of BMP4 activity , limbs display a variable penetrance of preaxial and postaxial polydactyly , but otherwise , normal digit patterns and apparently normal skeletal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( Figure 1G and 1O ) take place .
As previously described , mice homozygous for a null mutation in Bmp7 [ 12 ] have no defects in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the normal appendicular skeletal elements ( Figure 1H and 1P ) .
We do occasionally observe preaxial polydactyly in these mutants .
Compound heterozygous mice , with one functional copy each of Bmp2 and Bmp4 in the limb ( Bmp2 + / C ; Bmp4 + / C ; Prx1 : : cre ) , show no effect on either limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> or <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> ( unpublished data ) .
Similarly , limb skeletons of mice in which both copies of the Bmp4 gene and one copy of the Bmp2 gene have been conditionally removed in the limb ( Bmp2 + / C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre ) are phenotypically normal other than exhibiting the variable penetrance preaxial and postaxial polydactyly seen in mice deficient in BMP4 activity alone ( Figure 1J and 1R ) .
In contrast , mice in which both copies of Bmp2 and one copy of Bmp4 had been removed ( Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4 + / C ; Prx1 : : cre ) showed more severe skeletal defects , including significantly thinner skeletal elements .
However , the digit patterns of those animals are completely normal ( Figure 1I and 1Q ) .
Animals in which both copies of Bmp2 and Bmp4 were removed ( Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre ) had extremely malformed limbs ( Figure 1K and 1S ) .
They displayed severely short and malformed stylopods ; one of the zeugopod elements was almost always missing , and the remaining one was so deformed that it was difficult to identify the element correctly .
Moreover , the joint articulations are defective such that zeugopod and stylopod elements are fused ( see below and Figure S1A -- S1C ) .
Interestingly , the autopods are less affected than the proximal elements .
Nonetheless , the autopod elements are significantly reduced in size , and strikingly the two posterior-most digits are missing in the forelimbs of these animals .
Simultaneous removal of BMP2 and BMP7 had far less of an effect than did removal of BMP2 and BMP4 activity .
Compound heterozygous removal of BMP2 and BMP7 ( Bmp2 + / C , Bmp7 + /  ; Prx1 : : cre ) and heterozygous removal of BMP2 with complete removal of BMP7 ( Bmp2 + / C , Bmp7  /  ; Prx1 : : cre ) were both completely wild-type in skeletal pattern and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( unpublished data ) .
Mice homozygous for removal of Bmp2 and heterozygous for Bmp7 ( Bmp2C/C , Bmp7 + /  ; Prx1 : : cre ) displayed the same subtle scapular defect seen in Bmp2C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mutants alone ( unpublished data ) .
In limbs <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> in the complete absence of both BMP7 and BMP2 activity ( Bmp2C/C , Bmp7  /  ; Prx1 : : cre ) , the last phalanx was missing from digit III in the forelimb , and these limbs displayed the same phenotype in the hindlimb with variable penetrance ( Figure 1L and 1T , black arrow ) .
Additionally , the fibulae of these hindlimbs are malformed and do not articulate with the femur at the knee ( Figure 1T , thick red arrow ) .
They also display the same scapular defects seen in Bmp2C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice , and the overall size of the appendicular skeleton is slightly diminished .
However , skeletal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> appears normal in the limbs of these animals .
Soft Tissue Syndactyly Observed in Limbs of Mice Devoid of BMP2 and BMP4 Activity .
As noted above , Bmp2-deficient animals display a variably penetrant 3/4 soft tissue syndactyly phenotype ( Figure 2B ) .
In contrast , Bmp4-deficient mice show no evidence of syndactyly ( unpublished data ) .
However , one of the striking defects observed in the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice is that in the newborn animals , the digits of both forelimb ( unpublished data ) and hindlimb show complete syndactyly ( Figure 2D ; compare to wild-type , Figure 2C ) .
To determine the origin of this defect , we examined embryonic limbs at E15 .5 , the stage when interdigital separation is normally taking place ( Figure 2E ) .
In Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre limbs , only the very distal tips of each digit were separated , with the autopod adopting the shape of a notched pallet ( Figure 2F ) .
In wild-type <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , the individual digits become free from one another through a process of interdigital apoptosis , observable by staining with acridine orange ( Figure 2E and 2G , arrow ) .
Interdigital <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> is dramatically reduced in the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre limbs ( Figure 2F and 2H , arrow ) .
( Note that the strong acridine orange staining in Figure 2H is not in the interdigital mesenchyme but rather is in the remnant of the cells of the AER [ red asterisk ] . )
Another region of very prominent <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in the wild-type limb bud is within the AER .
The AER is a specialized ridge of ectoderm running along the anterior-posterior axis at the distal margin of the early limb bud .
One of the phenotypes characterizing the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mutant is <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the AER ( see below ) .
Moreover , in the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre animals , the AER is maintained as late as E15 .5 , long after it has started to <termsem="GO:0060033"> degrade </term> in wild-type limbs .
This can be seen morphologically ( unpublished data ) or by staining for <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of AER-specific marker such as Fgf8 ( Figure 2I and 2J ) .
The AER displays intense staining with acridine orange , TUNEL , or other markers for <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> at every stage when it is present , reflecting the rapid turnover of cells in this structure [ 33 -- 35 ] .
The Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mutant limbs at E15 .5 show strong acridine orange staining in the remnants of AER ( Figure 2H , asterisk ) , in domains of the distal tip where the AER remains the longest ( compare staining in Figure 2F and 2J ) .
No significant difference was observed in the extent of apoptosis in the cells of the AER in earlier stage Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mutant embryonic limbs ( Figure S1D -- S1G ) .

<termsem="GO:0007165"> BMP signaling </term> has been proposed to play several distinct roles in limb <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> .

SHH <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> itself extends over a long range in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limb bud , based on both activation of target genes [ 36 ] and <termsem="GO:0008104"> protein distribution </term> [ 37 ] .
Nonetheless , some models have suggested that the <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> effect of this <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenic </term> signal is mediated entirely [ 10 ] or in part [ 11 ] by BMP2 and BMP7 <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> as secondary signals in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to SHH .
We have removed both BMP2 and BMP7 activities in the early limb bud ( Figure 1 ) , and moreover , there is no apparent <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of BMP4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the posterior of these limbs ( Figure 3A -- 3D ) .
The skeletal phenotypes of mouse limbs <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in the absence of BMP2 , BMP7 , and both BMP2 and BMP7 are illuminating , as none of these exhibit significant digit pattern defects ( Figure 1 ) .
While a distal phalanx is missing in the middle digits of the double mutants ( Bmp2C/C , Bmp7  /  ; Prx1 : : cre ) , this is not a phenotype consistent with a decrease or loss of a <termsem="GO:0009949"> posteriorly derived polarizing activity </term> .
Indeed , the terminal phalanx <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> at the distal tip of each digit by a distinct mechanism , not dependent upon <termsem="GO:0009952"> anterior-posterior patterning </term> [ 38 ] .
These data strongly indicate that BMP2 and BMP7 are not required secondary signals for SHH-mediated polarization of the digits along the anterior-posterior axis .
The lack of transformations in digit identity in the limb skeletons <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 activity also argues against <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> being the critical instructive signal from the interdigital mesenchyme to the <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> digits .
While a distal phalanx was lost from the middle digit of the forelimbs of these animals , these digits do not otherwise have a morphology consistent with their being transformed anteriorly into digit 1 ( thumb ) .
Indeed , in the hindlimbs , where the penetrance of the phenotype is variable , the mutant middle digits are otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type , other than the presence or absence of this variable skeletal element .
In contrast to the proposed roles for BMPs in anterior-posterior digit patterning , we obtained further support for the well-accepted idea that a threshold level of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is necessary interdigitally for <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> to occur .
We observed syndactyly with variable penetrance in limbs <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> without BMP2 activity ( Figure 2B ) , and nearly complete soft tissue syndactyly of all digits in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 ( compare Figure 2C and Figure 2D ) .
The one dramatic <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> defect we observed in our BMP deficiency series was the loss of posterior digits in forelimbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 1K ) , also observed in earlier limb buds stained to show no <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the condensation marker Sox9 ( Figure 3 ) .
To understand this phenotype , we analyzed limb buds at various stages using a series of molecular markers .
By E11 .5 , the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre limb buds are noticeably broader , <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> in the posterior relative to wild-type .
This correlates with an anterior expansion in Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 3E and 3F , red bracket ) and a concomitant <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the AER as visualized by Fgf8 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 3G and 3H , red bracket ) .
The expansion in Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> can first be detected at E10 .5 and persists at least until E12 .5 , well after the time normal Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> disappears at E11 .75 ( Figure 3L and 3P ) .
The <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the AER in the absence of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> may be understood on the basis of the feedback loop between the zone of <termsem="GO:0007164"> <termsem="GO:0065001"> polarizing activity </term> </term> ( ZPA ) and the AER .
Expression of several Fgf genes [ 20,21 ] and maintenance of the AER itself [ 23 ] normally depend on BMP antagonism induced by SHH .
Thus , a decrease in <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> <termsem="GO:0008283"> expands </term> and maintains the AER .
Because Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is , reciprocally , supported by <termsem="GO:0008543"> FGF signaling </term> from the AER [ 8,24 ] , this , in turn , feeds back on the ZPA , expanding Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
While this explains the broader hand plate of the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limb buds , it is somewhat paradoxical in terms of the skeletal phenotype , as a broadened autopod would normally be expected to result in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of extra digits ( polydactyly ) ( e.g. , Figure 1G and 1O of this paper and [ 16 ] ) , not the loss of digits , as observed in the double mutant forelimbs .
To examine the loss of digits more closely , BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limb buds were examined during <termsem="GO:0001502"> cartilage condensation phase </term> of the digit rays at E12 .5 .
In wild-type limb buds the condensation of all five digits can be visualized at this stage by in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> with a probe directed against Sox9 , the earliest known <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> marker ( Figure 3I ) .
However , in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre limb buds at E12 .5 , Sox9 only detects primordia of the anterior three digits of the forelimb , indicating a failure in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of posterior digits at this earliest stage ( Figure 3J ) .
Genes such as Msx2 ( Figure 3N ) continue to be <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the posterior forelimb mesenchyme , indicating that the posterior forelimb tissue is viable at E12 .5 in the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre animals .
Msx2 is normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the non - <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> interdigital mesenchyme at this stage ( Figure 3M ) , a continuation of an earlier <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domain throughout the distal mesenchyme .
This <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Msx2 in the posterior of the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient forelimbs reflects a failure of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> in this region .
The loss of the posterior forelimb digits in these mice thus does not appear to represent a decrease in <termsem="GO:0007164"> <termsem="GO:0065001"> polarizing activity </term> </term> leading to a change in digit identity rather a consequence of the overall level of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> falling below a threshold for initiating <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> in the posterior of these forelimbs .
The posterior of the hindlimb in the mutant , in contrast , appears to remain above this threshold , and more than five digit condensations <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in the hindlimb bud ( Figures 3K and 1S ) and no ectopic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Msx2 is observed in the posterior ( Figure 3O ) .
Skeletal <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> in Limbs <termsem="GO:0032502"> Developing </term> with Reduced Levels of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP Signaling </term> .
BMPs were first discovered in the context of their <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenic activity </term> .
We therefore wanted to determine whether the loss of the specific BMP molecules under investigation here would perturb the skeletal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation pathways </term> .
Accordingly , skeletal preparations from each of the various mutant alleles were subjected to histological and molecular analyses .
The skeletal elements that <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in the absence of BMP2 , BMP4 , or BMP7 or BMP2 and BMP7 all underwent normal <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> and <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> by a series of criteria .
All showed normal staining with Alcian blue ( for cartilage ) and Alizarin red ( for <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> tissue , see Figure 1 ) .
Most were also analyzed in histological sections stained with toluidine blue and showed osteoid <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and bone matrix deposition ( compare Figure S2A and S2E ; and unpublished data ) .
The skeletal elements in these various BMP-deficient animals contained normal prehypertrophic chondrocytes <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> type II collagen , hypertrophic chondrocytes <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> type X collagen , as well as the osteoblasts <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> type I collagen , like their wild-type counterparts ( Figure S2 ; compare Figure S2F -- S2H with Figure S2B -- S2D ; and unpublished data ) .
In contrast , however , limbs completely deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 activity showed severe defects in skeletal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
BMP2 and BMP4 Are Not Critical for <termsem="GO:0051216"> Chondrogenic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> .
As noted above , at E12 .5 , <termsem="GO:0001502"> <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> condensation </term> of the digits could be visualized in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre limb buds by in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> with a Sox9 probe .
Similar analysis at E10 .5 and E11 .5 demonstrated a relatively normal process of condensation of the proximal skeletal elements ( Figure S1H -- S1M ) , despite the absence of detectable Bmp2 and Bmp4 transcripts .
As shown in Figure S1N and S1O , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col II , a chondrocyte marker , is observed in the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient cartilage ( Figure S1O ) as early as E12 .5 , similar to a wild-type control ( Figure S1N ) .
Similarly , at E13 .5 , the entire limb skeleton could be visualized undergoing <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> by Alcian blue staining , albeit in a defective pattern , in the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limb buds ( Figure 4A and 4B and unpublished data ) .
As the cartilage elements <termsem="GO:0040007"> grow </term> , a wave of hypertrophic <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> occurs from the center toward the distal ends ( reviewed in [ 39 -- 41 ] ) .
Histological examination of the humeri at E13 .5 showed that while <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> had taken place in the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient humerus , hypertrophic <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> was delayed ( Figure 4C and 4D ) .
However , by E15 .5 , hypertrophy was evident in these elements as seen by type X collagen <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 4E and 4F ) .
The hypertrophic cells in BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limb also <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> late hypertrophic markers , such as osteopontin [ 42 ] ( unpublished data ) .
To examine whether the successful execution of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> in the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limbs is a result of compensatory <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of other <termsem="GO:0001503"> ostegenic </term> BMPs , we carried out in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> for Bmp6 and Bmp7 in these limbs .
At E13 .5 , we observed no increase in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Bmp6 ( Figure S1P -- S1S ) or Bmp7 ( compare Figure 4H with Figure 4G ) mRNA in the mutant tissues compared to their wild-type counterparts .
<termsem="GO:0001503"> Osteogenesis </term> Is Initiated Normally in BMP2 , BMP4 -- Deficient Limb Buds .
<termsem="GO:0001503"> Bone formation </term> first occurs at the interface between the late hypertrophic chondrocytes and the surrounding perichondrium , a region identified as the bone collar .
We examined whether the <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> program is initiated in the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limbs using several histological and molecular criteria , as described below ( Figure 5 ) .
Adjacent to the hypertrophic cells , a bone collar is laid down normally in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 5A and 5B , red star ) .
As can be seen in sagittal sections through an E15 .5 humerus , the cells embedded in the <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> matrix <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> the osteoblast marker Col I as normal ( Figure 5C and 5D ) .
By E17 .5 , the <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> cartilage that makes up the late hypertrophic zone of the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate normally undergoes removal by osteoclasts ( Figure 5G , brown-stained cells , red arrows ) , resulting in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of a bone marrow cavity ( red arrow in Figure 5E and 5I , see also Figure 6 ) .
Osteoprogenitor cells from bone collar region now populate this site and deposit osteoid , <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> the trabecular bone in the bone marrow cavity ( Figure 6E , red arrow ) and cortical bone at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( Figure 5I , asterisk ) .
In contrast , in E17 .5 limbs deficient in BMP2 and BMP4 , there is an overall delay in the normal endochondral process ( Figure 5F ) .
While <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascularization </term> occurs in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre forelimbs , few osteoclasts are <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> to the <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> cartilage ( compare Figure 5G and Figure 5H , red arrows ) , resulting in a delay in bone marrow cavity <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 .
In fact , <termsem="GO:0048539"> bone marrow formation </term> and trabecular <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> have not yet started at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ( Figure 5J ) , and the morphology of Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre bones at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> is most similar to control embryos at E17 .5 ( Figure 5E ) .
To differentiate between a simple delay in <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 and the inability to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> bone without these BMPs , we performed histological analyses in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice up to 3 wks of age .
As shown in Figure 6A through 6E , in the control mice , a bone collar is found adjacent to the zone of late hypertrophic chondrocytes at 1 wk ( Figure 6A and 6B ) .
Many osteoblasts line the newly <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> cortical bone in the diaphyseal region ( Figure 6C , blue arrow ) , and <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of a secondary <termsem="GO:0001503"> ossification </term> center has begun ( Figure 6A , red star ) .
At 3 wks of age , <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the secondary <termsem="GO:0001503"> ossification </term> center is complete ( Figure 6D , red star ) , along with robust <termsem="GO:0048539"> bone marrow formation </term> ( Figure 6D , bm ) and deposition of trabecular bone ( Figure 6E , pale blue tissue marked by red arrow ) .
In stark contrast , <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> is not observed in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 at 1 or 3 wks after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( Figure 6F -- 6J ) .
The appearance of the skeletal elements in the double mutants remains similar to E17 .5 structures seen in wild-type limbs ( Figure 5E ) , and although there is a bone collar at the site of hypertrophic cartilage ( Figure 6G ) , no bone marrow cavity , trabecular bone , or cortical bone is present ( Figure 6F ) .
Many osteoclasts have been <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> to the remaining <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> cartilage and are actively <termsem="GO:0045453"> resorbing </term> this tissue ( red asterisks , Figure 6I ) , so that by 3 wks , all the <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> cartilage in the diaphyseal region has disappeared , leaving a void where <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> should have occurred ( Figure 6J , also see Figures 6L and S3 ) .
This void is eventually invaded by soft tissues and the adjacent muscle ( marked s and m , respectively , in Figure 6J ) .
The <termsem="GO:0045453"> resorption of bone </term> at 3 wks of age is clearly visible in the proximal femur of mutant animals where a portion of that bone is missing ( Figure 6L , black arrow ) .
The inability to complete osteoblast <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice results in strikingly defective limb morphology at 1 wk of age ( compare Figure S3G and S3H ) .
To determine if any osteoblast <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> occurs in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre forelimbs , we examined osteoblast-related <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> ( Figure 7 ) .
In the control mice , osteoblasts lining the surface of trabecular and cortical bone <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> type I collagen , runx2 , and osterix genes at both 1 wk and 3 wks after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( Figure 7A -- 7D and 7I -- 7L ) .
In the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 , cells which are fibroblastic in appearance ( Figure 6H ) are found adjacent to the <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> cartilage surfaces .
These cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> amounts of type I collagen and runx2 comparable to control osteoblasts , but their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of osterix , while noticeable at 1 wk , becomes almost undetectable at 3 wks ( Figure 7E -- 7H and 7M -- 7P ) .
These results allow us to conclude that the fibroblast-like cells resident in the bone shaft ( Figure 6H ) may be osteoprogenitor cells unable to <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> into mature osteoblasts in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 .
Using a genetic approach to remove activity of different Bmp genes during <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> , we have found that BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 either individually or in combination are not required for <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> of normal digit identities .
However , BMP2 and BMP4 are required in concert to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> condensation of the posterior digit anlagen .
We have also shown that <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> can be initiated and <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> will take place even in the absence of both BMP2 and BMP4 or BMP2 and BMP7 .
On the other hand , BMP2 and BMP4 together are required for completion of <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> .
<termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP Signaling </term> and <termsem="GO:0007389"> Pattern Formation </term> .
It has been proposed that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> may be involved in digit <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> as a secondary signal originating in the ZPA [ 7,11,43 ] or as a later mediator of interdigital <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> information [ 15 ] .
In particular , BMP2 , a <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> factor that is induced by SHH [ 8 ] in the posterior limb bud , has been suggested to act as a true <termsem="GO:0016015"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> morphogen </term> </term> secondary to SHH <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> to properly <termsem="GO:0007389"> pattern </term> the limb digits .
However , inactivation of Bmp2 during early limb bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> clearly does not cause any digit <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> defects .
BMPs are known , in many cases , to function redundantly [ 44 ] .
In considering potential secondary signals mediating ZPA activity , the most relevant family member to consider is BMP7 as , like BMP2 ( and unlike BMP4 ) , it is <termsem="GO:0048518"> positively regulated </term> by SHH <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> [ 7 ] .
However , Bmp7 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> does not overlap with Bmp2 in the early mouse limb bud [ 45 ] , and in any case , mice in which we conditionally knocked out Bmp2 in the Bmp7  /  background do not show any obvious digit <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> defect other than the missing final phalanx in digit III .
Although still poorly understood , the final phalanges <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> at the tip of every digit through a process distinct from the more proximal phalanges [ 38 ] .
Our data implicate <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> in this process .
At later stages , <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> has been suggested to play a role in mediating the <termsem="GO:0007165"> transfer </term> of positional information from the interdigital mesenchyme to <termsem="GO:0007389"> specify </term> the identity of the adjacent digits [ 15 ] .
Application of the BMP antagonist noggin to the interdigital tissue at the time of digit condensation results in loss of phalanges and a resultant pattern that can be interpreted as an anterior homeotic transformation in digit identity .
However , increasing BMP concentrations interdigitally with exogenous protein does not result in the reciprocal posterior transformations , and the noggin experiments can also be interpreted simply as a block in the condensation of the primordia of distal phalanges when BMP activity is completely abolished [ 38 ] .
Decreasing the level of interdigital <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> , without abolishing it , provides an opportunity for differentiating between these models .
If <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> were only required as a permissive factor for <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> , partial reduction in the level of <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> might have no effect .
However , if levels of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> were instructive in terms of digit identities , then a substantial decrease in the amount of BMP ligand present should cause transformations in digit identity .
This is not what is observed , either in limbs deficient in both BMP2 and BMP4 or in those deficient in BMP2 and BMP7 .
It should be noted that the interdigital <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domains form several days after <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> of the floxed BMP alleles is complete .
Moreover , there is no detectable compensatory <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of BMP7 in the interdigital mesenchyme of the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limbs ( compare Figure 4G and Figure 4H ) .
Thus , we conclude that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is not likely to be responsible in a quantitative fashion for the instructive role of interdigital mesenchyme in <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishing </term> digit identities .
However , in the Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre forelimbs , there is a complete loss of posterior digit ray condensations , presumably because the total level of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> falls below the threshold for initiation of condensation , as previously seen in cases where BMP antagonists have been used [ 27,28 ] .
It is worth noting that the defects in <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> seen in the BMP2 , BMP4 -- deficient limbs are much more severe proximally than distally .
This is particularly significant because proximal elements condense and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> before distal ones .
Thus , if the conditional alleles were partially <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> at early stages and only completely <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> at later stages , it is the distal elements , <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> after greater <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> has taken place , that should be more severely affected .
Since it is the proximal elements which are more severely affected , the explanation for the difference in severity must lie elsewhere .
This is most likely explained by compensation in the distal limb bud by BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> in the AER .
Compensation by BMPs in the AER also likely explains a difference seen between the Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice in our experiments and a recently published analysis [ 16 ] , which used the identical Bmp4 conditional allele and Prx1 : : cre driver .
The earlier report , like ours , described preaxial and postaxial polydactyly .
However , they observed these phenotypes with less variability and , moreover , described multiple preaxial and postaxial ectopic digits , while we saw , at most , a single preaxial and postaxial digit .
The difference is that the mice analyzed in the previous report had one null allele and one conditional allele , while ours had two conditional alleles .
Their mice , therefore , lost a half-dose of BMP4 from the AER in addition to complete loss in the mesenchyme , while our conditional alleles were only <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> in the mesenchyme by the Prx1 : : cre driver .
It is also possible that the difference in severity relates to the time required to <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombine </term> one as opposed to two floxed alleles ; however , we do not favor this explanation as all detectable BMP4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is lost prior to any morphological differences between the mutant and wild-type limb buds .
Finally , differences in genetic background could contribute to the differences as the Prx1 : : cre line is outbred .
A final aspect of <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> previously associated with <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is interdigital <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
Consistent with this , we see some syndactyly in the BMP2-deficient limbs .
The fact that this is variable , and limited to the 3/4 interdigit , implies that the threshold for <termsem="GO:0006917"> induction of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> </term> is low enough that loss of BMP2 , BMP4 or BMP7 or BMP2 and BMP7 still leaves sufficient <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> for most interdigital <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> to occur normally .
However , loss of both BMP2 and BMP4 results in complete soft tissue syndactyly , i.e. , webbing between all the digits .
Although BMP activity has been previously implicated in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> interdigital <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , this is the first genetic verification of their requirement for this process .
<termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP Signaling </term> and <termsem="GO:0001501"> Skeletal Development </term> .
As discussed above , our data indicate that threshold levels of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> are required for initiating <termsem="GO:0001502"> <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenic </term> condensation </term> , consistent with prior results [ 26 -- 28 ] .
However , once <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> begins , cartilage <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> can be sustained , albeit with some detectable delay , in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 or in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 .
Thus , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of either BMP5 , BMP6 , and BMP7 ( in the absence of BMP2 and BMP4 ) or the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of BMP4 , BMP5 , and BMP6 ( in the absence of BMP2 and BMP7 ) is sufficient to support mesenchymal condensation and chondrocyte <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limb .
In one set of previous studies implicating <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> in <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> , Yoon et al. [ 26 ] showed that if mice lose both Alk3 ( BmprIa ) and Alk6 ( BmpIb ) , two of the three type I <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> used in <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signal transduction </term> , there is a dramatic decrease in the size of skeletal primordial due to a reduction of <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and increase in <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
The size of the skeletal elements in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre limbs are also decreased compared to those of control mice , although not to the extent seen in the double <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> mutant .
We do not know if reduced size of the skeletal elements in our study is similarly due to reduced <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and increase in <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , lack of replacement by bone , or a combination of these .
It is possible that a triple mutant removing BMP2 , BMP4 , and BMP7 activities would have a similar phenotype as the BmprIa , BmprIb double mutant , although these could also be compensated from other BMPs .
We do know , however , that <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> is defective in these mice , although <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> proceeds normally in siblings retaining one functional copy of either the Bmp2 or Bmp4 gene ( Figure S4 ) , as it does in mice completely deficient in BMP2 and BMP7 ( Figures 1 and S2 ) .
The phenotype we observe in limbs of Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice is similar to the phenotype reported for osterix knockout mice [ 46 ] , which exhibited severe defects in osteoblastic <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Since we observe fibroblastic cells adjacent to <termsem="GO:0031214"> mineralized </term> cartilage that have characteristics of osteoprogenitor cells but fail to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> osterix in the absence of both BMP2 and BMP4 , one important role of BMP2 and BMP4 during <termsem="GO:0001958"> endochondral ossification </term> may be to induce osterix <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in osteoprogenitors .
Strikingly , however , we do observe osterix <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the bone collar of E16 .5 mice missing functional copies of both the Bmp2 and Bmp4 genes ( K. Tsuji and A. Bandyopadhyay , unpublished data ) .
This suggests that varying levels of expression from different BMP genes during preaxial and postaxial <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> result in fluctuations in total levels of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> , which at distinct times are above or below the threshold for supporting <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenesis </term> .
While many <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenic </term> BMP molecules , apart from BMP2 and BMP4 , such as BMP5 , BMP6 , and BMP7 , are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> during the endochondral process , our data suggest that these BMP molecules can not compensate for the combined loss of BMP2 and BMP4 in <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> .
Recent biochemical and genetic experiments have suggested that individual BMPs have identical functions .
BMP2 , BMP4 , BMP5 , BMP6 , and BMP7 can utilize the same type I ( Alk2 , Alk3 , and Alk6 ) and type II <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> ( BMP RII , ActRII , and ActRIIb ) [ 47 ] .
Once the complex between ligand and <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> is <termsem="GO:0022607"> formed </term> , BMP2 , BMP4 , BMP5 , BMP6 , and BMP7 <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> the <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylation </term> of the same set of BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> -- specific Smads ( 1 , 5 , or 8 ) , and the signal that is <termsem="GO:0007165"> transduced </term> by each BMP appears to be identical in the skeletal target cells [ 48 -- 51 ] .
BMPs have also been shown to activate <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0043491"> AKT pathways </term> and , based on current published information , each of the <termsem="GO:0001503"> osteogenic </term> BMPs appears to have the same capacity to activate these <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> [ 52 -- 54 ] .
When this information is considered along with our observation that one allele of either Bmp2 or Bmp4 can rescue the osteoblast <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> phenotype observed in Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C ; Prx1 : : cre mice ( see Figures 1I , 1J , 1Q , and 1R and S4 ) , we favor the hypothesis that <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> requires a threshold amount of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> which is not met when both BMP2 and BMP4 are completely absent .
We can not , however , exclude the possibility that BMP2 and BMP4 have distinct functions in <termsem="GO:0002076"> osteoblastogenesis </term> .
Our analysis of <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletogenesis </term> indicates that BMP2 and BMP4 are prerequisite for <termsem="GO:0002076"> osteoblastogenesis </term> while less important for <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> .
These studies provide the first evidence linking BMP2 and BMP4 with <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> in an in vivo setting where the preceding events of <termsem="GO:0051216"> chondrogenesis </term> are not compromised .

Bmp2C/C ; Bmp4C/C mice carrying floxed alleles of the Bmp genes without Prx1 : : cre are wild-type ( WT ) .
Genotyping of animals were done by PCR analyses with the primers ( 5  -- 3  ) GTGTGGTCCACCGCATCAC ( AHP2 -- 9 ) and GGCAGACATTGTATCTCTAGG ( AHP2 -- 35 ) for Bmp2 and AGACTCTTTAGTGAGCATTTTCAAC ( No. 79 [ order of primers tried ] ) and AGCCCAATTTCCACAACTTC ( No. 80 ) for Bmp4 following extraction of genomic DNA from embryonic or adult tail .
For Bmp2 , the floxed allele amplifies as a 545-bp product , while the wild-type allele amplifies as a 474-bp product .
For Bmp4 , the floxed allele amplifies as a 220-bp product , while the wild-type allele amplifies as a 180-bp product .
Protocols utilized for mouse experiments were approved by the Harvard University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( Cliff Tabin # 02735 ) .
The strategy for <termsem="GO:0000003"> generating </term> a Bmp2 conditional null in the BMP7  /  background is similar to the strategy used for <termsem="GO:0009058"> generating </term> the Bmp2 , Bmp4 double conditional allele with three important differences .
First , the Bmp7  /  ( strain kindly donated by Dr. Liz Robertson [ 12 ] ) is not a conditional allele but a null mutation .
Second , Bmp7  /  mice do not survive past <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> due to kidney failure [ 12 ] and hence can not be maintained as homozygous for the null allele .
Third , Bmp2 and Bmp7 are on the same chromosome ( Chromosome 2 ) .
To obtain Bmp2C/C , Bmp7  /  ; Prx1 : : cre we crossed Bmp2C/C , Bmp7  / + females with Bmp2C / + , Bmp7  / + ; Prx1 : : cre males .
Bmp2C/C , Bmp7  /  ; Prx1 : : cre progeny were obtained at a rate slightly higher than 1 in 16 .
For genotyping of Bmp7 locus we used the following set of primers : Bmp7_ExI_5  ( 5  -- 3  ) TCGCCTGCAGCAAGTGACCTCGGGTC ; Bmp7_ExI_3  ( 5  -- 3  ) TAGGGGTAGGAGAAGCCCTGTCCGTCC and Beta-geo 5  of 3  ( 5  -- 3  ) CTGCATACGCTTGATCCGGCTACCTGC .
From a wild-type chromosome Bmp7_ExI_5  and Bmp7_ExI_3  amplifies an approximately 423-bp PCR product , while from the lacZ insertion mutant this pair fails to amplify any product .
Bmp7_ExI_5  and Beta-geo 5  of 3  ( this primer is designed from the Beta-geo cassette ) amplifies an approximately 1-kb PCR product from the lacZ inserted chromosome .
