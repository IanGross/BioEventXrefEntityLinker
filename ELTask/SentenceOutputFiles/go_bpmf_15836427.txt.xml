A <termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmental </term> Switch in the <termsem="GO:0050896"> Response </term> of DRG Neurons to ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> Transcription </term> Factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> .
Two ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> of the Pea3 subfamily are induced in subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> and spinal <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons by target-derived factors .
Their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> late aspects of neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> such as target invasion and <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> .
Here , we show that the late onset of ETS <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> is an essential requirement for normal <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neuron <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
We provide genetic evidence in the mouse that precocious ETS <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in DRG <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons perturbs axonal projections , the acquisition of terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> markers , and their dependence on <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support .
Together , our findings indicate that DRG <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons exhibit a temporal <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> switch that can be revealed by distinct <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> to ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> at sequential steps of <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> .
Neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is a protracted process during which newly <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> neurons <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> distinct cellular and molecular programs at precise times during their <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> : <termsem="GO:0007409"> long-distance axon outgrowth </term> , subsequent terminal <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> , and finally <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> .
Many important aspects of neuronal character appear to be acquired through the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> at progenitor cell stages , whereas others depend on <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> immediately upon <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit [ 1 ] .
But whether the orderly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and activity of <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs at much later <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages , well after <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit , is an essential step in the progression of neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and circuit <termsem="GO:0032502"> assembly </term> has yet to be resolved .
The <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons of dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) has been studied extensively with respect to <termsem="GO:0031128"> inductive events </term> that <termsem="GO:0001708"> specify </term> neuronal fate [ 2,3 ] , as well as the involvement of late target-derived <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factors in the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of neuronal survival [ 4 ] .
Recent evidence has begun to emerge that target-derived factors are also involved in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> later aspects of neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 5,6,7 ] .
In particular , genetic experiments have addressed the survival-independent role of <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factors during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> by exploiting strains of mice defective both in neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> and in the function of the <termsem="GO:0043065"> proapoptotic </term> gene Bax [ 8,9 ] .
These studies , for example , have revealed that neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> the acquisition of peptidergic traits in <termsem="GO:0019233"> nociceptive </term> DRG neurons and the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of target innervation [ 8,9 ] .
The onset of some <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs in neurons , however , has also been shown to occur long after neurons exit the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> .
An emerging principle from work in Drosophila and vertebrates is that target-derived factors play a crucial role in the induction of these <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs [ 10 ] .
In Drosophila , retrograde BMP signals from the target region <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> the terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of a subpopulation of peptidergic neurons <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> Apterous and Squeeze [ 11,12 ] .
In vertebrates , peripheral <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> signals have been shown to <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> the onset of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> Er81 and Pea3 in DRG <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron pools several days after these neurons have become post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> [ 9,13,14,15,16 ] .
Moreover , the induction of Er81 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents is known to be mediated by peripheral neurotrophin 3 ( NT-3 ) [ 9 ] .
These two ETS proteins <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> late aspects of spinal monosynaptic circuit <termsem="GO:0032502"> assembly </term> , with Er81 <termsem="GO:0065007"> directing </term> <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive sensory </term> neuron <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and Pea3 <termsem="GO:0065007"> directing </term> <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron pool <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , respectively [ 14,15 ] .
In particular , in the absence of Er81 , achieved by mutation in the gene or by deprivation of peripheral neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , group Ia <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents fail to invade the ventral spinal cord and to <termsem="GO:0032502"> make </term> effective synaptic connections with <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons [ 9,14 ] .
The involvement of target-derived signals in induction of ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> raises the question of the necessity for the observed delay in the onset of ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> for <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> .
Would precocious <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ETS proteins in post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> neurons also <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> the appropriate <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> <termsem="GO:0048666"> neuron developmental </term> programs ?
In this study , we have used mouse genetics to test this general idea , by investigating whether the precise timing of onset of ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is essential for normal <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> <termsem="GO:0048666"> neuron development </term> .
We have assessed the biological effects of inducing ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> either at the correct <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> time , or precociously .
We find that within <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive sensory </term> neurons , the late onset of ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is essential for the establishment of normal <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> afferent projections in the spinal cord .
Precocious initiation of ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> in post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> DRG neurons leads to abnormal DRG neuron <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> characterized by neurotrophin-independent neurite outgrowth and inappropriate profiles of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> .
Our findings reveal that target-triggered inductive signals provide an effective means of ensuring the late onset of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , and thus an orderly temporal <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> sequence that is crucial for <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> and circuit <termsem="GO:0032502"> assembly </term> .
To test the hypothesis that a temporal delay in the onset of <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs is crucial for the control of appropriate <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> , we studied the development of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> DRG neurons , since <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> effectors <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by target-derived signals , as well as some of their downstream <termsem="GO:0008150"> biological actions </term> , have been identified for these neurons .
Er81 <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent connectivity [ 14 ] , and we therefore sought to identify an ETS <termsem="GO:0030528"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulator </term> </term> that , when <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> over the normal time course of Er81 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , is able to substitute for Er81 function within group Ia afferent <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons .
With this reference point , we then designed experiments to examine the effects of precocious post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the same ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> on <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neuron <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
EWS-Pea3 Can Replace Er81 Function in <termsem="GO:0065007"> Controlling </term> Ia Afferent Projections .
We first defined an ETS <termsem="GO:0030528"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> regulator </term> </term> that is able to replace the function of Er81 within <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents to <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> projections into the ventral spinal cord .
Er81 , Pea3 , and Erm constitute the Pea3 subfamily of ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , show a high degree of amino acid identity , and <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to very similar DNA target sequences [ 17,18,19 ] .
Nevertheless , when introduced into the Er81 locus in analogy to a previously used targeting strategy ( data not shown ; [ 14 ] ) , neither Pea3 nor Erm could rescue Ia <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent projections to extensively invade the ventral horn of the spinal cord ( data not shown ) .
These findings prompted us to analyze mice in which we integrated EWS-Pea3 , a break-point fusion product between the amino-terminal domain of the Ewing sarcoma ( EWS ) gene and the Pea3 <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> domain [ 20,21 ] , into the Er81 locus ( Figure 1 ) .
We found that in a <termsem="GO:0045289"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> luciferase </term> </term> - enzyme-based cell culture <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> assay , EWS-Pea3 showed stronger transactivation activity than Er81 or Pea3 ( Figure 1J ; data not shown ) , in agreement with previous studies [ 22,23,24 ] .
Moreover , transactivation by EWS-Pea3 was abolished by mutation of ETS - <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> sites in the reporter plasmid , demonstrating ETS - <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> - site dependence ( data not shown ) .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Er81 in DRG neurons of embryos containing integration of EWS-Pea3 in the Er81 locus ( Er81EWS-Pea3 /  ) was abolished ( Figure 1E ) , and the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level of the <termsem="GO:0005509"> calcium-binding </term> protein Parvalbumin ( PV ) in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents , which is decreased approximately 5 - to 10-fold in Er81 mutants [ 14 ] , was comparable to wild-type levels in Er81EWS-Pea3 /  embryos ( Figure 1F -- 1H ) .
To further define DRG neuron <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the presence of EWS-Pea3 in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents in vivo , we assessed whether replacement of Er81 by EWS-Pea3 had an influence on neuronal survival or on the expression of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> - afferent-specific genes .
Er81EWS-Pea3 /  mice did not differ from wild-type in the number of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent cell bodies within the DRG of L1 to L5 , the expression of several genes normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents , and the lack of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> not normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents ( Figure S1 ; data not shown ) .
Together , these findings suggest that the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 from the normal time of onset mimics the function of Er81 as assessed by induction and maintenance of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> within <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents .
To determine the extent of rescue of Ia <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord of Er81 mutant mice achieved by <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 , we traced intraspinal afferent projections by axonal labeling of PV ( Figure 2A -- 2C ) .
In addition , to analyze axon ingrowth independent of the level of PV <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in DRG neurons , we used anterograde labeling of afferent fibers by applying fluorescently labeled dextran to cut dorsal roots ( Figure 2D -- 2F ) .
Using both assays , we found extensive rescue of the projections into the ventral horn of the spinal cord in Er81EWS-Pea3 /  mice ( Figure 2C and 2F ) .
Within the ventral horn , Ia afferents in both wild-type and Er81EWS-Pea3 /  mice <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> vGlut1 + terminals that were absent in Er81 mutant mice ( Figure 2G -- 2I ) .
To assess whether synapses between Ia afferents and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons are functional in Er81EWS-Pea3 /  mice , we performed intracellular recordings from identified quadriceps <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons after stimulation of nerves innervating the quadriceps muscle group .
We found no significant difference in the input amplitude to quadriceps <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons when comparing wild-type to Er81EWS-Pea3 /  mice ( Figure S2 ; wild-type , 10.6  0.9 mV , n = 11 ; Er81EWS-Pea3 /  , 10.9  1 mV , n = 8 ) .
Together , these findings suggest that in the absence of Er81 , EWS-Pea3 can <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> the complex <termsem="GO:0008150"> biological process </term> of correct laminar termination within the ventral spinal cord and the <termsem="GO:0007416"> formation of synapses </term> with <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons ( Figure 2J -- 2L ) , thus identifying an ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> suitable for heterochronic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> experiments in DRG neurons .
Precocious <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 in DRG Neurons Leads to Axonal Projection Defects .
To address the consequences of precocious ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> for <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , we next <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> EWS-Pea3 in DRG neurons as soon as they became post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> .
We used a binary mouse genetic system based on Cre - <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> - mediated excision of a <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> stop </term> cassette flanked by loxP sites .
Targeting cassettes were integrated into the Tau locus to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> two strains of mice conditionally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> either EWS-Pea3 or a <termsem="GO:0006612"> membrane-targeted </term> green fluorescent protein ( mGFP ) to trace axonal projections of DRG neurons ( Figure S3 ; [ 25 ] ) .
Embryos positive for either Isl1Cre / + and TauEWS-Pea3 / + or Isl1Cre / + and TaumGFP / + alleles showed efficient activation of the silent Tau allele in 95 % or more of all DRG neurons , including <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents , at all segmental levels ( Figure S3 ) .
We first assessed the influence of EWS-Pea3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in early post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> DRG neurons on the establishment of afferent projections into the spinal cord using the TaumGFP / + allele or a Thy1-promoter - <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> synaptophysin green fluorescent protein ( spGFP ) with an <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> profile restricted to DRG <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons at embryonic day ( E ) 13.5 ( Thy1spGFP ; [ 25 ] ) ( Figure 3 ) .
In contrast to wild-type <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent projections ( Figure 3A -- 3C ) , GFP + <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> afferents in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos failed to invade the spinal cord and instead were found in an extreme lateral position at the dorsal root entry zone , a phenotype observed at least up to E18 .5 ( Figure 3A -- 3C and 3G -- 3I ; data not shown ) .
We next visualized the path of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> afferent projections towards the dorsal root entry zone in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos by injecting fluorescently labeled dextran into an individual DRG ( L3 ; n = 3 ; Figure 3M -- 3Q ) .
<termsem="GO:0007600"> Sensory </term> afferents in E13 .5 wild-type embryos bifurcated at their lateral spinal entry point , and projected rostrally and caudally over six or more segmental levels while gradually approaching the midline ( Figure 3M ) .
<termsem="GO:0007600"> Sensory </term> afferents in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos also bifurcated at the entry point , although approximately 5 % of afferent fibers continued to <termsem="GO:0040007"> grow </term> towards the midline ( Figure 3O and 3Q ) .
While rostro-caudal projections were present in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos , afferent fibers failed to approach the midline at distal segments and continued to occupy an extreme lateral position ( Figure 3O ) , consistent with the analysis of transverse sections .
We next examined the establishment of peripheral projections upon precocious EWS-Pea3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in DRG neurons .
While <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos reached the skin and <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> major nerve trunks by E16 .5 , only rudimentary <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axon <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> was <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> within the skin ( Figure 3D and 3J ) .
In addition , there was a significant reduction in the number of muscle spindles in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( approximately 25 % of wild-type complement ; n = 3 ) as assessed by innervation and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> specific for intrafusal muscle fibers such as Egr3 ( Figure 3E , 3F , 3K , and 3L ; [ 26 ] ) .
In summary , whereas isochronic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoted </term> the establishment of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent projections into the ventral spinal cord , precocious <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the same ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> factor in DRG neurons interfered with <termsem="GO:0030031"> establishment of projections </term> into the spinal cord as well as to peripheral targets .
Precocious EWS-Pea3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> <termsem="GO:0048518"> Promotes </term> Neurotrophin-Independent Survival and Neurite Outgrowth .
To begin to address the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the distinct <termsem="GO:0008150"> biological actions </term> of EWS-Pea3 at different <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages , we first turned to in vitro culture experiments .
These experiments permit assessment of whether precocious ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> influences neuronal survival and in vitro neurite outgrowth of DRG neurons , two parameters prominently influenced by target-derived <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factors and their <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> .
We cultured E13 .5 whole DRG explants from wild-type and TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the presence of NGF or NT-3 or in the absence of neurotrophins and analyzed neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth on matrigel substrate after 48 h in vitro .
Without <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support , very few wild-type DRG neurons survived ( Figure 4A ) .
In contrast , culturing wild-type DRG with <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factors led to neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth .
Addition of NGF , which supports survival of cutaneous afferents , resulted in straight and unbranched neurite outgrowth ( Figure 4B ) , while cultures <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> in the presence of NT-3 , which supports survival of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents , resulted in a highly <termsem="GO:0001763"> branched </term> neurite outgrowth pattern after 48 h in vitro ( Figure 4C ) .
Surprisingly , DRG neurons isolated from TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos and cultured without <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support survived after 48 h in vitro and had <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> long and highly <termsem="GO:0001763"> branched </term> neurites ( Figure 4D ) .
Neither the pattern of neurite outgrowth nor neuronal survival changed significantly after application of either NGF or NT-3 ( Figure 4E and 4F ) .
To directly compare neurotrophin dependence of DRG neurons <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> EWS-Pea3 from the Tau locus at a precocious versus isochronic time of onset , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> a strain of mice in which Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> from the PV locus ( Figure S4 ) .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of GFP in TaumGFP / + PVCre / + was restricted to PV + <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> DRG neurons and mirrored the onset of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of PV at approximately E14 ( Figure S4 ; data not shown ) .
We next cultured E14 .5 whole DRG explants from TauEWS-Pea3 / + PVCre / + and TaumGFP / + PVCre / + mice for 48 h in vitro in the presence or absence of NT-3 ( Figure 5 ) .
We found that DRG neurons from both genotypes survived and extended neurites only in the presence of NT-3 , whereas they <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> in the absence of NT-3 ( Figure 5 ) .
Together , these findings suggest that only precocious but not isochronic ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> in DRG neurons is capable of uncoupling survival and neurite outgrowth from a requirement for neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> normally observed in wild-type DRG .
To determine whether neuronal survival of DRG neurons from TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the absence of <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support is sufficient to explain the observed neuronal outgrowth , we analyzed DRG isolated from mice mutant in the <termsem="GO:0043065"> proapoptotic </term> gene Bax [ 27 ] .
Consistent with previous results , Bax  /  DRG neurons survived without <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support [ 28 ] .
In contrast , neurite outgrowth of Bax  /  DRG neurons was significantly less ( see Figure 4G ) than that of either DRG from TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos cultured in the absence of <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support ( see Figure 4D ) or Bax  /  DRG neurons cultured in the presence of <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support ( see Figure 4H and 4I ) .
These findings suggest that in addition to mediating neurotrophin-independent neuronal survival , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 in early post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> neurons also <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> neurite outgrowth in a neurotrophin-independent manner .
To begin to assess at which step of the neurotrophin <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling cascade </term> DRG neurons from TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos become unresponsive to the addition of neurotrophins , we assayed the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0005030"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neurotrophin receptors </term> </term> in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 6 ) .
Whereas <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the <termsem="GO:0005030"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neurotrophin receptors </term> </term> TrkA , TrkB , and TrkC marks afferents of distinct <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> modalities in DRG of wild-type embryos ( Figure 6A -- 6C ) [ 4,29 ] , TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos showed complete absence of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of TrkA , TrkB , and TrkC in DRG neurons at E16 .5 ( Figure 6G -- 6I ) .
This absence of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in DRG of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos provides a likely explanation for the lack of responsiveness of these neurons to the addition of <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factors .
We next assayed whether the complete absence of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos had an influence on naturally occurring <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> in vivo using TUNEL on DRG sections .
Surprisingly , we found that <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> was decreased by approximately 50 % ( n = 3 embryos , average of > 50 sections ) in DRG of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in comparison to wild-type ( Figure 6D , 6J , and 6M ) .
Quantitative analysis of the number of neurons in lumbar DRG of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos revealed a significant increase to approximately 170 % of wild-type levels ( Figure 6E , 6K , and 6N ) .
Moreover , BrdU pulse-chase experiments ruled out the possibility that DRG neurons in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos reenter the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> ( no BrdU + / LacZ + cells , n = 3 embryos , analysis of > 50 sections each ; Figure 6F and 6L ) .
Together with the in vitro culture experiments , these findings suggest that DRG neurons from TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos remain post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> but fail to become sensitive to naturally occurring <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> , and survive in the absence of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support .
We next analyzed whether changes in the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of proteins known to be involved in the <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of neuronal survival or <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> could be detected in DRG of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos .
We found no significant quantitative changes in the level of Akt/p-Akt or CREB/p-CREB in DRG ( Figure 6O and 6P ) both of which have been shown to be key regulators of neuronal survival [ 29 ] .
Moreover , the level of the <termsem="GO:0043065"> proapoptotic </term> Bcl2 family member Bax was not significantly reduced ( Figure 6O and 6P ) .
In contrast , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level of the <termsem="GO:0006916"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> </term> Bcl2 family members Bcl-xl and Bcl2 was significantly increased when compared to wild-type levels ( Bcl2 , 157 % ; Bcl-xl , 259 % ; average of n = 3 independent experiments ; Figure 6O and 6P ) , providing a potential molecular explanation for the <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> neuronal survival of DRG neurons of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos in the absence of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 30 ] .
Only Precocious but Not Isochronic ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> in DRG Neurons Interferes with <termsem="GO:0048663"> <termsem="GO:0048664"> <termsem="GO:0048665"> Neuronal Fate Acquisition </term> </term> </term> .
The observed differences in neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth between precocious and isochronic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 prompted us to perform a direct comparative analysis of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> between mice with precocious EWS-Pea3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and mice in which the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 is initiated in DRG <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons from the time of normal onset of Er81 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Moreover , to rule out the possibility that a differential effect may be due to the different genetic strategies by which <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents is achieved , we performed this analysis both in Er81EWS-Pea3 /  and TauEWS-Pea3 / + PVCre / + embryos .
We first analyzed <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of TrkC , a gene <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in DRG neurons of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 7A and 7B ) .
The level of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of TrkC was indistinguishable from wild-type in DRG neurons of Er81EWS-Pea3 /  and TauEWS-Pea3 / + PVCre / + embryos ( Figure 7A , 7C , and 7D ) .
Moreover , PV was not <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in DRG neurons of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure S5 ) but was <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents in both wild-type and Er81EWS-Pea3 /  embryos ( see Figures 1 and S5 ) [ 14 ] .
We also found several genes that were ectopically <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> in DRG neurons of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figure 7 ) .
Calretinin and Calbindin , two different <termsem="GO:0005509"> calcium-binding </term> proteins <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by subpopulations of DRG neurons in wild-type , Er81EWS-Pea3 /  , and TauEWS-Pea3 / + PVCre / + embryos ( Figure 7E , 7G , and 7H ; data not shown ) [ 31,32 ] , were induced in more than 95 % of all DRG neurons of TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos ( Figures 7F and S5 ) .
These findings suggest that DRG neurons in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Isl1Cre / + embryos fail to <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> to a normal fate and instead <termsem="GO:0001708"> <termsem="GO:0001709"> <termsem="GO:0045165"> acquire </term> </term> </term> an aberrant identity distinct from any subpopulation of wild-type DRG neurons .
Finally , to assess whether EWS-Pea3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> precociously acts exclusively cell-autonomously or whether it may also influence neighboring DRG neurons , we activated <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 using Hb9Cre mice [ 33 ] .
Due to a transient and rostro-caudally graded <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Hb9 at neural plate stages , very few DRG neurons at brachial levels and increasingly more neurons progressing caudally undergo <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in TauEWS-Pea3 / + Hb9Cre / + and TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8 ) .
Nevertheless , <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> or <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of Calretinin is restricted exclusively to neurons that have undergone <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> and can not be observed in TaumGFP / + Hb9Cre / + embryos ( Figure 8 ) .
Together , these results and the findings obtained from in vitro culture experiments ( see Figures 4 and 5 ) demonstrate that precocious or isochronic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of EWS-Pea3 in the same neurons leads to significantly different cell-autonomous <termsem="GO:0051716"> cellular responses </term> with respect to <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , neuronal survival , and neurite outgrowth ( Figure 9 ) .
Target-derived signals exhibit a conserved role in the induction of defined programs of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> late in post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 10 ] .
This study provides evidence that the late onset of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is essential for many later aspects of neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and circuit <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
Our data indicate that DRG neurons undergo a temporal change in their competence to <termsem="GO:0050896"> respond </term> to ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , as assessed by changes in <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> and axonal target invasion ( Figure 9 ) .
Our findings argue for the necessity of target-induced , and therefore temporally <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> , upregulation of ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
More generally , they suggest that temporally <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> activation of <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs coupled to a particular fate induced in neurons at early <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages represents an important <termsem="GO:0042551"> mechanism of neuronal maturation </term> .
One striking observation of this study is that precocious induction of ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> neuronal survival without a requirement for <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> support and in complete absence of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
In contrast , ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> at the normal time of onset of Er81 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> does not result in <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> neuronal survival in the absence of neurotrophins and also does not lead to <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> of TrkC <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents .
These findings demonstrate very distinct activities of one <termsem="GO:0030528"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulator </term> </term> at different <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> steps within a <termsem="GO:0045165"> committed </term> post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> neuronal lineage .
The absence of Trk <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> upon precocious induction of ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> can only partially explain the observed phenotype in axonal projections .
Elimination of TrkA <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> in Bax mutant mice perturbs establishment of peripheral projections of cutaneous afferents , whereas establishment of central projections does not appear to be affected [ 8 ] .
In the absence of NT-3 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , development of central as well as peripheral <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent projections is perturbed [ 9 ] .
In contrast , upon precocious induction of ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , we found more pronounced defects in the establishment of central rather than peripheral projections for all DRG neurons .
Induction of Er81 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents is <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> by peripheral NT-3 as axons reach the vicinity of target muscles , and thus occurs only approximately 3 d after <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> neurons become post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> [ 9,14 ] .
This temporally delayed and target-induced <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> several days after a neuronal lineage of a specific identity first emerges is not restricted to DRG <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons , but is also found in <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron pools [ 13 ] .
Target-derived factors have also been implicated in <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlling </term> <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> of predetermined neurons in Drosophila , in which <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of members of the BMP family in the target region is essential for the induction of mature peptidergic properties in a subpopulation of neurons marked by the coordinate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the two <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> Apterous and Squeeze [ 11,12 ] .
Thus , both in Drosophila and vertebrates , target-derived factors appear to act permissively to induce the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs involved in terminal <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> .
Our findings are compatible with a model in which DRG neurons <termsem="GO:0001708"> <termsem="GO:0001709"> <termsem="GO:0045165"> acquire </term> </term> </term> their mature fate by sequential and temporally <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> addition of lineage-specific features ( Figure 9 ) .
Target-derived factors act on predetermined neuronal lineages to switch their <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> programs to become compatible with processes such as target invasion and <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> .
Such a transition state in the acquisition of a defined neuronal fate would be accompanied by the induction of appropriate <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> programs through the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> .
Mechanisms such as <termsem="GO:0006338"> chromosomal remodeling </term> that restrict or expand access to certain target genes [ 34 ] or activation by cofactors responsible for changing the action of particular <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors [ 35 ] could represent possible mechanisms by which the downstream <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> profile of a <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> could be temporally shifted towards the selection and <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of distinct target genes .
Interestingly , several ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> are activated through release of autoinhibition via interaction with cofactors and/or via <termsem="GO:0043687"> post - <termsem="GO:0006412"> translational </term> modifications </term> [ 35,36,37 ] .
The fusion of EWS with Pea3 could circumvent a need for activation through specific cofactors while still maintaining ETS site dependence , thus rendering EWS-Pea3 less sensitive to the cellular context than endogenous ETS <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> .
Using this fusion protein , our experiments demonstrate a profound change in the action of ETS signaling at the level of <termsem="GO:0045449"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulation </term> within post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> DRG neurons over time .
Moreover , the observed <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> shift in ETS <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is paired with the onset of appropriate regulation of neuronal subtype <termsem="GO:0001708"> specification </term> and establishment of axonal projections into the target area .
Recent experiments addressing the temporal constraints of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> action in <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> neural progenitor cells adds to the idea that defined temporal windows , during which <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> act to <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> distinct downstream target genes , are of key importance to <termsem="GO:0048663"> <termsem="GO:0048664"> <termsem="GO:0048665"> neuronal fate acquisition </term> </term> </term> .
During Drosophila <termsem="GO:0014019"> neuroblast generation </term> , the <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> Hunchback <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> specification and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of early-born neuroblasts [ 38 ] .
Over time , however , neuroblasts progressively lose their competence to <termsem="GO:0032502"> generate </term> cells of an early fate in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to Hunchback <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 39 ] .
These findings thus also argue for a change in cellular competence to <termsem="GO:0050896"> respond </term> to a specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> over time albeit in an early precursor context .
More generally , during the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> lineages , several <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> have also been shown to exhibit distinct functions at progressive steps of <termsem="GO:0001708"> lineage specification </term> [ 40 ] .
Analysis of the mechanisms by which <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> programs can be shifted over time to <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> different complements of downstream genes and thus different aspects of neuronal and cellular fates in progenitor cells or post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> neurons may provide further insight into the way in which <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> act to <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> the <termsem="GO:0032502"> assembly </term> of neuronal circuits .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of transgenic mice and mouse genetics .
Er81EWS-Pea3 mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> following a strategy similar to that described for the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of Er81NLZ mice [ 14 ] .
In brief , a targeting vector with a cDNA coding for EWS-Pea3 was inserted in frame with the endogenous <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006413"> start </term> </term> ATG into exon 2 of the Er81 genomic locus and used for homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in W95 ES cells .
EWS-Pea3 represents a fusion gene between the amino terminal of EWS and the ETS domain of Pea3 [ 20 ] .
The primer pair used to specifically detect the Er81EWS-Pea3 allele was 5  - CAGCCACTGCACCTACAAGAC-3  and 5  - CTTCCTGCTTGATGTCTCCTTC-3  .
For the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of TaumGFP and TauEWS-Pea3 mice , lox-STOP-lox-mGFP-IRES-NLS-LacZ-pA and lox-STOP-lox-EWS-Pea3-IRES-NLS-LacZ-pA targeting cassettes were integrated into exon 2 of the Tau genomic locus ( the endogenous <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006413"> start </term> </term> ATG was removed in the targeting vectors ; details available upon request ) .
mGFP was provided by P. Caroni [ 25 ] .
ES cell recombinants were screened by Southern blot analysis using the probe in the 5  region as described previously [ 41 ] .
Frequency of <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in 129/Ola ES cells was approximately 1/3 for both Tau constructs .
For the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of PVCre mice , mouse genomic clones were obtained by screening a 129SV/J genomic library ( Incyte , Wilmington , Delaware , United States ) .
For details on the genomic structure of the mouse PV locus see [ 42 ] .
An IRES-Cre-pA targeting cassette [ 33 ] was integrated into the 3  UTR of exon 5 , and ES cell recombinants were screened with a 5  probe ( oligos , 5  - GAGATGACCCAGCCAGGATGCCTC-3  and 5  - CTGACCACTCTCGCTCCGGTGTCC-3  ; genomic DNA , HindIII <termsem="GO:0009056"> digest </term> ) .
The frequency of <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in 129/Ola ES cells was approximately 1/20 .
<termsem="GO:0006310"> Recombinant </term> clones were aggregated with morula stage embryos to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> chimeric founder mice that transmitted the mutant alleles .
In all experiments performed in this study , animals were of mixed genetic background ( 129/Ola and C57Bl6 ) .
Thy1spGFP transgenic mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> in analogy to De Paola et al. [ 25 ] , and for these experiments a strain of mice with early embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was selected .
Isl1Cre and Hb9Cre mouse strains have been described [ 33,43 ] and Bax + /  animals were from Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , Maine , United States ) [ 27 ] .
Timed <termsem="GO:0007565"> pregnancies </term> were set up to <termsem="GO:0032502"> generate </term> embryos of different <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages with all genotypes described throughout the study .
<termsem="GO:0006350"> Transcriptional </term> transactivation assays .
