Identification of collagen-induced arthritis loci in aged multiparous female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Collagen-induced arthritis in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> is one of the most commonly used autoimmune experimental models , with many similarities to rheumatoid arthritis .
Since collagen-induced arthritis is a complex polygenic disease there is a need for identification of several major disease-controlling genes .
Because rheumatoid arthritis particularly affects aged women , we have in the present study identified new genetic regions critical for collagen-induced arthritis by studying aged female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> of a cross between NFR/N and B10.Q ( H-2q haplotype ) .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in the present study had different reproductive histories , which did not significantly affect the onset , incidence or severity of the disease .
A total of 200 female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were used in a total genome-wide screening with 125 microsatellite markers .
We found one new significant quantitative trait locus affecting the arthritis incidence , severity and day of onset on chromosome 11 ( denoted Cia40 ) , which colocalizes with a locus controlling pregnancy failure .
Furthermore , a quantitative trait locus of suggestive significance associated with the incidence , severity and day of onset was identified on chromosome 1 .
Finally , a suggestively significant quantitative trait locus associated with collagen type II antibody titers was identified on chromosome 13 .
This study indicates that several gene loci control arthritis in aged multiparous females , and that at least one of these loci coincides with pregnancy failure .
The similarities between rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> man </term> and collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> are well established , although differences in the disease pattern exist [ 1-3 ] .
Characteristic of RA is the fact that women of reproductive age are more susceptible to the disease than men [ 4 ] .
It has also been reported that 75 % of female patients ( 23 out of 31 females ) with RA exhibit clinical remission during the course of pregnancy [ 5 ] .
On the other hand , it has been suggested that the onset of RA is postponed by parity .
The risk of onset is reduced during pregnancy , while in the first year postpartum the chance of onset is increased [ 6,7 ] .
The results of a recent study of RA in women , however , indicate that pregnancy history does not increase the incidence of the disease later in life [ 8 ] .
Adequate <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> models are useful tools for the identification of genes involved in complex <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> diseases .
CIA in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> shares both immunological and pathological characteristics with <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> RA and is one of the most used models for the identification of genes and mechanisms involved in arthritis .
The incidence of CIA is sex dependent , like the incidence in RA , although different species and different variants of the disease could lead to both male and female predominance .
Male <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> are more often affected than females .
Gender differences in CIA susceptibility are dependent on many factors , including genetic , hormonal and behavioral influences [ 9 ] .
However , isolated factors are remarkably consistent between RA and the different <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> models [ 3,9 ] .
Pregnancy in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , like pregnancy in women , normally causes remission of arthritis [ 5,10 ] , while exacerbation often occurs postpartum [ 7,10,11 ] .
Pregnancy-induced remission of CIA in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> appears to be caused by the increase in estrogen levels , while the postpartum exacerbation can be explained by the dramatic drop in estrogen [ 10 ] , possibly together with increased prolactin levels [ 11 ] .
To what extent the pregnancy history ( parity ) affects the incidence of CIA later in life has , to our knowledge , not previously been studied .
Importantly , RA occurs predominantly in women , many of which have had several children , and it is therefore appropriate to also mimic this situation using <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> models .
In the present paper we have analyzed female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that previously had undergone a reproductive study ( Liljander M , Sllstrm MA , Andersson S , Wernhoff P , Andersson  , Holmdahl R , Mattsson R , unpublished data ) .
A total of 200 female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( ten months of age ) of the N2 backcross between NFR/N and C57BL/B10 .
Q ( B10.Q ) were used to analyze the genetic control of CIA in aged females with a multiparous history .
Inbred NFR/N <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were originally obtained from the National Institute of Health ( Bethesda , MD , USA ) and the B10.Q <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were originally bought from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) .
( B10Q  NFR/N ) F1 hybrids and ( B10.Q  NFR/N )  B10.Q N2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were bred in individual ventilated cages in the BMC Barrier <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> facility and at the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> house of the Department of Pathology , Lund University , Sweden .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> were fed ad libitum with standard <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodent </term> chow ( LAB FOR R36 , irradiated breeding food for <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rats </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ; Lactamin AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) and water in a photoperiod of 12 hours : 12 hours light : dark .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> used in the present study had clean health monitoring protocols according to the Federation of European Laboratory <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> Animal </term> Sciences Association recommendations .
Ethical permissions were M125-04 ( embryo transfer ) and M290-03 ( reproduction and arthritis ) .
A total of 200 female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( approximately ten months old ) of N2 backcross ( B10.Q  NFR/N )  B10.Q were used .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> had earlier undergone a reproductive study where each <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> had four mating opportunities .
First , the female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were allowed to mate twice with B10.RIII males ( allogeneic mating by means of MHC ( major histocompatibility complex ) and finally to mate twice with B10.Q males ( syngeneic mating by means of MHC ) .
After four possible pregnancies CIA was induced to the female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Induction and evaluation of CIA .
To induce CIA , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 100 g <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> collagen type II ( CII ) emulsified in 0.1 M acetic acid combined with an equal amount of complete Freud 's adjuvant ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , MI , USA ) .
A booster injection containing 50 g CII emulsified in 0.1 M acetic acid combined with an equal amount of Freud 's incomplete adjuvant ( Difco Laboratories ) was given after 30 days .
The clinical scoring of arthritis commenced 25 days after the first immunization .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> Animals </term> were examined for clinical signs of CIA three times per week and were graded on a 12-point scale .
The arthritis index was assigned to each <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> using the following criteria : 0 = no visible sign of arthritis , 1 = redness and swelling in a single joint , 2 = inflammation in multiple joints , and 3 = severe inflammation in the entire paw and/or anklebone .
Each paw was given the scores 0 -- 3 , with the index being the sum of all four paws .
The severity trait is the maximum score observed in each individual female .
The onset is the number of days calculated from the first immunization to the first clinical signs of arthritis excluding unaffected <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> .
Microsatellite genotyping and linkage analysis .
Tail biopsies were collected from all N2 females and the F0 generation .
DNA was isolated according to a previously described protocol [ 12 ] .
After screening of parental DNA with approximately 450 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> fluorescence-labeled microsatellite markers ( INTERACTIVA , Ulm , Germany ) , 125 informative markers were selected covering the genome .
Two hundred and thirty-seven N2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were genotyped with markers covering all chromosomes except for the Y chromosome .
PCR amplification for the markers was performed in a final volume of 10 l in a 96-well V-bottom microtiter plate using 20 ng DNA , 10 mM KCl , 20 mM Tris -- HCl , 10 mM ( NH4 ) 2SO4 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , pH 8.8 ( New England BioLabs Inc. , Ipswich , MA , USA ) , 3 M ( 10 pmol ) each primer , 2 mM dNTPs ( Advanced Biotechnologies , Epsom , Surrey , UK ) and 0.25 U <termsem="NCBITaxon:271"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Taq </term> </term> DNA Polymerase ( New England BioLabs Inc. ) .
The following program was used to amplify the DNA : denaturation at 95 C for 3 minutes , annealing at 56 C for 45 seconds , polymerization at 72 C for 1 minute , 30 cycles of 95 C for 30 seconds , 56 C for 45 seconds and 72 C for 1 minute , and a final extension step of 7 minutes at 72 C .
The PCR products were analyzed on a MegaBACE  1000 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc Piscataway , NJ , USA ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
Data were analyzed with Genetic Profiler 1.1 ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc ) .
Map Manager QTXb20 free software [ 13 ] was used to perform linkage analysis and the permutation test .
Ninety percent of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> genome was within a 20 cM intermarker distance .
The marker map was generated using the Kosambis map function and 1,000 permutations were performed for every phenotype ( P < 0.05 ) .
The permutation tests were carried out to establish empirical significance thresholds for the interactions .
A threshold equal to or above the 37th percentile ( P = 0.63 ) was considered suggestively significant , and the level for the significant threshold was set to the 95th percentile ( P = 0.05 ) .
Interval mapping was made with a 2 cM increase under the additive regression model in order to calculate the test statistics .
The adult female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were sacrificed at 15 months of age and sera were collected .
Anti-CII antibody titers in sera were analyzed by a sandwich ELISA technique [ 14 ] .
In brief , CII ( 10 g/ml ) was coupled to immunosorbent plates overnight at 4 C .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:27592"> Bovine </term> serum albumin ( Sigma Chemical St Louis , MO , USA ) was used for blocking , and thereafter different dilutions of control sera ( purified <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> anti-CII antibodies ) , test sera , and positive and negative controls were added .
The presence of CII-specific IgG was visualized by means of peroxidase-conjugated <termsem="NCBITaxon:9925"> goat </term> antimouse IgG .
Statistical comparison between the different experimental groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test or Student 's unpaired t test .
NFR/N female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> show delayed onset and lower incidence of CIA compared with B10.Q females .
The onset of the disease was significantly delayed in NFR/N <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , which resulted in lower incidence in the initial phase of the disease ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) .
The appearance of the arthritis was slightly different between the two strains , NFR/N <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> showing a higher frequency of swelling of the entire paw than B10.Q <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Later in the disease course the differences in CIA frequency and severity between the strains were less obvious .
However , the anti-CII titers 100 days after primary immunization ( and 70 days after the booster ) differed significantly between NFR/N and B10.Q female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( see Table 1 ) .
Pregnancy history does not significantly affect incidence or severity of CIA in female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> of mixed genetic background .
Table 2 presents the results of arthritic incidence , arthritis onset and maximum arthritic score for the female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> of the N2 generation , ( NFR/N  B10.Q )  B10.Q , grouped according to the number of pregnancies they had experienced prior to immunization with CII .
There was no significant difference in the incidence or severity of arthritis depending on the number of pregnancies that had been passed prior to the induction of the disease .
We observed a trend towards lower severity in multiparous <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> compared with <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> with a history of zero to two pregnancies .
The onset of diseases , however , was earlier in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that had passed more than one pregnancy .
There was no difference in the development of the disease between female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that have only been pregnant with MHC mismatched males ( B10.RIII ) and female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that only have been pregnant with MHC matched males ( B10.Q ) .
New loci associated with CIA in identified old female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
The genetic linkage analysis revealed one significant quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) located at 64 -- 70 cM on chromosome 11 ( Table 3 and Figure 2 ) .
This locus ( denoted Cia40 ) gave significant LOD scores for the traits incidence ( LOD = 4.1 ) and ` day of onset ' ( LOD = 4.0 ) , and a suggestive LOD score for the trait ` arthritis score ' ( LOD = 3.3 ) .
Another QTL of suggestive significance for the incidence of disease was identified around 27 cM on chromosome 1 ( Figure 2 ) .
Finally , a suggestive QTL for the trait anti-CII antibody titer was identified on chromosome 13 ( Figure 2 ) .
Although carrying the same CIA-susceptible MHC region , the NFR/N and B10.Q <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> are different in several respects .
The NFR/N <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , which is an inbred NMRI <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> of the H-2q haplotype , is larger in size than the B10.Q <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and is also known for its extraordinarily good breeding properties .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> used in the present study , ( NFR/N  B10.Q )  B10.Q females , first underwent a genetic study of reproduction , in which a number of loci associated with breeding performance were identified ( Liljander M , Sllstrm MA , Andersson S , Wernhoff P , Andersson  , Holmdahl R , Mattsson R ; unpublished data ) .
Since the parental strains differ in susceptibility to CIA , in spite of both having the MHC class II A beta genes [ 15 ] , we wanted to test the susceptibility to inflammatory disease in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> from this cross .
In fact , this situation gave an opportunity to study the genetic control of arthritis in aged multiparous females , a common situation in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> RA .
This susceptibility was important to investigate for various reasons .
The fact that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> differed in their reproductive history made it possible to analyze whether this would significantly affect the incidence or severity of CIA .
Second , almost all the linkage analyses performed for detection of CIA-associated loci in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> have been carried out with male <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Another reason is that the use of old multiparous <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> mimicked the RA situation ( older women is the major risk group ) .
Finally , the NFR/N strain had not previously been used in linkage analyses for detection of CIA-associated loci , which opened ( up ) the possibility of detecting new polymorphic genes of importance in this disease .
The first conclusion from the present paper is that multiparity does not negatively influence the incidence or severity of CIA induced later in life ( Table 2 ) .
This is in agreement with results from a recent study of RA in women , which similarly indicates that previous experience of pregnancy does not negatively affect the incidence or severity of RA later in life [ 8 ] .
It is worth noting that the situation is quite different if pregnancy is entered during ongoing arthritis .
This will normally lead to a temporary remission of the disease in both <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> , followed by an exacerbation phase after delivery [ 7,10,11 ] .
The second conclusion from this study is that loci of possible importance for CIA have been detected , two associated with arthritis susceptibility ( chromosomes 1 and 11 ) and one associated with anti-CII titers ( chromosome 13 ) .
Some arthritis loci have previously been identified on chromosome 1 : Cia15 at 8 cM [ 16 ] , Cia20 at 44 cM [ 16 ] and Cia9 at 92 cM [ 17 ] .
However , none of these loci appears to be close to the locus found on chromosome 1 in the present study .
The newly identified Cia40 locus includes the Ctla4 ( CD152 ) gene , which is a strong candidate associated with spontaneous diabetes identified in crosses between C57Bl and nonobese diabetic strains [ 18 ] .
Analyses of CIA in crosses of the same backgrounds , however , did not identify a linkage to this locus , suggesting that the polymorphism underlying Cia40 differs from the genes associated with diabetes [ 18 ] .
Interestingly , Bauer and colleagues previously identified a locus ( Cia28 ) associated with anti-CII antibody production at 53 cM on chromosome 13 [ 19 ] , which is approximately at the same position as where we find the linkage for this trait in the present study .
It is therefore most likely that the QTL we have identified on chromosome 13 is the same as Cia28 .
Since the possible new locus of potential interest on chromosome 1 was of suggestive significance , and since the locus identified on chromosome 13 probably is Cia28 , we are now paying special attention to the significant QTL for CIA incidence detected at 60 -- 70 cM on chromosome 11 ( denoted Cia40 ) .
No other CIA genes have previously been typed in this region , but the central part of chromosome 11 is known to contain a number of inflammation loci , such as Eae22 , Eae6b , Eae23 and Eae7 [ 20-22 ] .
One QTL for proteoglycan-induced arthritis , which was female specific for disease onset , have also been found on chromosome 11 .
Although this locus ( Pgia28 ) is not located in the vicinity of Cia40 , it is worth noting [ 23 ] .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> chromosome 11 contains several genes that are highly conserved with <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 17 .
Linkages for <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> RA have been found in this particular region [ 24 ] .
Another interesting locus is Cia5 on the homolog <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> chromosome 10 , which regulates the severity of CIA and pristane-induced arthritis [ 25 ] .
Interestingly , from studies with the same cross , we have previously detected a significant QTL denoted Pregq2 for the trait ` pregnancy frequency ' in the very same region as Cia40 ( peak at 64 -- 70 cM on chromosome 11 ) ( Liljander M , Sllstrm MA , Andersson S , Wernhoff P , Andersson  , Holmdahl R , Mattsson R , unpublished data ) .
This means that this region contains genes affecting the CIA incidence in multiparous <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in addition to the rate of successful deliveries in female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
The ` pregnancy rate ' in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> is defined as successful pregnancies per detected vaginal plug , a phenotype associated with early pregnancy failure , which in turn possibly could have an inflammatory cause .
We can not exclude that the same gene ( s ) are affecting both these traits .
Our results show that multiparity does not negatively influence the incidence or severity of CIA induced later in life .
Furthermore , two new loci linked to CIA susceptibility were detected on chromosome 11 ( Cia40 ) and on chromosome 1 .
We detected on chromosome 13 a locus associated with anti-CII titers , which probably is the same as the recently reported Cia28 [ 19 ] .
CIA = collagen-induced arthritis ; CII = collagen type II ; LOD = logarithm of the odds ; MHC = major histocompatibility complex ; PCR = polymerase chain reaction ; QTL = quantitative trait locus ; RA = rheumatoid arthritis .
