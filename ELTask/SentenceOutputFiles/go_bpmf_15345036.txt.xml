The phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> has essential functions during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> but not in <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell removal </term> .
<termsem="GO:0006909"> Phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells is fundamental to animal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , <termsem="GO:0002376"> immune function </term> and <termsem="GO:0019725"> cellular homeostasis </term> .
The phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> ( Ptdsr ) on phagocytes has been implicated in the recognition and <termsem="GO:0043652"> engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> and in <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
To determine the biological function of the phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> in vivo , we inactivated the Ptdsr gene in the mouse .
Ablation of Ptdsr function in mice causes perinatal lethality , <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation and a delay in terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of the kidney , intestine , liver and lungs during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> .
Moreover , <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye development </term> can be severely disturbed , ranging from defects in retinal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> to complete unilateral or bilateral absence of eyes .
Ptdsr - / - mice with anophthalmia <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> novel lesions , with <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of ectopic retinal-pigmented epithelium in nasal cavities .
A comprehensive investigation of <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that <termsem="GO:0043652"> engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> was normal in Ptdsr knockout mice , but Ptdsr-deficient macrophages were impaired in pro- and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokine </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells or with lipopolysaccharide .
Ptdsr is essential for the development and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of multiple organs during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> but not for <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell removal </term> .
Ptdsr may thus have a novel , unexpected <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> function as an important <termsem="GO:0045597"> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> - promoting </term> gene .
Moreover , Ptdsr is not required for <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> by macrophages but seems to be necessary for the regulation of macrophage <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokine </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> .
These results clearly contradict the current view that the phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> primarily functions in <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> .
<termsem="GO:0012501"> Programmed cell death </term> , or <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , is required for the normal development of almost all multicellular organisms and is a physiological mechanism for <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlling </term> cell number ; as a result , structures that are no longer needed are deleted during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and abnormal cells are <termsem="GO:0012501"> eliminated </term> [ 1,2 ] .
Most of the cells <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> during mammalian <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> undergo physiological <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> before the end of the perinatal period [ 3 ] .
<termsem="GO:0006915"> Apoptotic </term> cells are removed rapidly and efficiently as intact cells or <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> bodies by professional phagocytes or by neighboring cells .
This highly <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> process prevents the release of potentially noxious or immunogenic intracellular materials and constitutes the fate of most <termsem="GO:0016265"> dying </term> cells throughout the lifespan of an organism [ 4,5 ] .
<termsem="GO:0006909"> Phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells is very distinct from other <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfment processes </term> that result , for example , in the clearance of microorganisms , because <termsem="GO:0043652"> engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> triggers the <termsem="GO:0046903"> secretion </term> of potent <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0050777"> immunosuppressive </term> mediators , whereas pathogen <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognition </term> causes the <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> of <termsem="GO:0050729"> pro- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> signals [ 6 ] .
Almost all cell types can <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognize </term> , <termsem="GO:0050896"> respond </term> to , and <termsem="GO:0006911"> ingest </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells by using specific sets of <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytic </term> <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> that <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to specific ligands on <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
Detailed genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans have recently yielded evidence that basic <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytic mechanisms </term> and pathways for the recognition and engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells are highly conserved throughout phylogeny [ 7,8 ] .
In vertebrates , a number of <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> have been identified that can mediate <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
These include , for example , <termsem="GO:0005044"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> scavenger receptors </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0008329"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> pattern <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognition </term> receptors </term> </term> such as CD36 , SR-A and CD14 , integrins such as the vitronectin <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> v3 , and members of the collectin family and their <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> CD91 and calreticulin [ 9-13 ] .
The individual roles of these molecules in <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> , <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> or transduction of <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> signals upon <termsem="GO:0043654"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell recognition </term> have not been well defined , however [ 5,6,14 ] .
The importance of efficient mechanisms for <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> in vivo is supported by the observation that autoimmune <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> can be provoked in mice when key molecules for <termsem="GO:0043654"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell recognition </term> and uptake are missing .
This has been reported for knockout mice lacking the complement protein C1q [ 15 ] , for mice with a mutation in the <termsem="GO:0004714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> tyrosine kinase receptor </term> </term> gene Mer [ 16 ] and , more recently , in mice lacking <termsem="GO:0003810"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transglutaminase </term> </term> 2 or milk fat globule epidermal <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> 8 ( MFG-E8 ) [ 17,18 ] .
The exposure of the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS ) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells has been described as one of the hallmarks of the <termsem="GO:0006917"> induction of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> </term> and is considered to be one of the most important signals required for <termsem="GO:0043654"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell recognition </term> and removal [ 19 ] .
A number of cell-surface and bridging molecules can interact with exposed PS on <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
These include the serum proteins 2-glycoprotein 1 and protein S [ 20,21 ] , the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> - <termsem="GO:0007050"> arrest </term> - specific gene product GAS-6 [ 22 ] , <termsem="GO:0006956"> complement activation </term> products [ 23 ] , the milk fat globule protein MFG-E8 [ 24 ] , and annexin I [ 25 ] .
In most cases the <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> on phagocytes that <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognize </term> these PS-bridging molecules have not been defined , but it has been reported that GAS-6 is a ligand for the <termsem="GO:0004714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> tyrosine kinase receptor </term> </term> Mer and that MFG-E8 can <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to the vitronectin <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> v3 [ 16,24 ] .
Other molecules that <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> PS with varying specificity are the lectin-like <termsem="GO:0018158"> oxidized </term> <termsem="GO:0005041"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> low-density lipoprotein receptor </term> </term> -1 ( LOX-1 ) and the <termsem="GO:0005044"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> scavenger receptors </term> </term> CD36 and CD68 ( for review see [ 5 ] and references therein ) .
The best-characterized molecule so far that <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> PS in a stereo-specific manner is the phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> ( Ptdsr ) [ 26 ] .
In vitro , it has been shown that the Ptdsr can mediate the <termsem="GO:0043652"> uptake of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> and that such Ptdsr-mediated <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> can be inhibited through addition of PS liposomes , the <termsem="GO:0001786"> PS-binding </term> molecule annexin V or an anti-Ptdsr antibody [ 26 ] .
Moreover , the binding of Ptdsr to PS on <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells has been reported to be important for the <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> of <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> mediators , including transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> - 1 ( TGF-1 ) , <termsem="GO:0030168"> platelet-activating </term> factor ( PAF ) , and prostaglandin E2 [ 26,27 ] .
These data supported the hypothesis that Ptdsr fulfils a role as a crucial <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> switch after the engagement of macrophages with <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells and is thereby fundamental for preventing local <termsem="GO:0006955"> immune responses </term> to <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells before their clearance [ 28 ] .
Very recently , Ptdsr has been found in the cell nucleus .
Its nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> is mediated by five independent nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> signals , each of which alone is capable of <termsem="GO:0006605"> targeting </term> Ptdsr to the cell nucleus [ 29 ] .
Moreover , an additional study performed recently in Hydra showed an exclusively nuclear localization for the Ptdsr protein [ 30 ] .
Most interestingly , the nuclear localization of Ptdsr in Hydra epithelial cells did not change upon <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
These reports challenge the original hypothesis , according to which Ptdsr is an exclusively <termsem="GO:0004888"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transmembrane receptor </term> </term> for <termsem="GO:0043654"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell recognition </term> and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
To examine further the role of Ptdsr in vivo , we performed <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene-expression </term> and gene-targeting studies in mice .
A perinatally <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> phenotype was observed in Ptdsr-knockout mice , and Ptdsr-deficient embryos displayed multiple defects in tissue and organ <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
While this work was in progress , both Li et al. [ 31 ] and Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] also reported the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> and phenotypic characterization of Ptdsr-knockout mice .
Of note , although some of their results were confirmed in our study , we found a fundamentally different phenotype with regard to <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
Moreover , our study revealed marked and unexpected findings in Ptdsr-deficient mice that are not related to <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of Ptdsr-deficient mice .
To investigate in vivo the functions of the phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> Ptdsr , we <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> a null allele in the mouse by gene targeting ( Figure 1a ,1 b ,1 c ) .
In contrast to previously described Ptdsr-knockout mice [ 31,32 ] , we used Bruce4 embryonic stem ( ES ) cells for gene targeting [ 33 ] , thus <termsem="GO:0009058"> generating </term> a Ptdsr-null allele in a pure , isogenic C57BL/6J genetic background .
The newly <termsem="GO:0000003"> established </term> knockout mouse line was named Ptdsrtm1Gbf ( hereafter referred to as Ptdsr - / - ) .
Heterozygous Ptdsr + / - mice were viable and fertile and showed no obvious abnormalities .
Ptdsr + / - mice were intercrossed to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> homozygous Ptdsr-deficient mice .
The absence of Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Ptdsr - / - embryos was confirmed by <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR ( data not shown ) , and by northern and western blotting analyses ( Figure 1d , e ) .
Interbreeding of heterozygous mice showed that the mutation was <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> , since homozygous mutants were not detected in over 100 analyzed litters at weaning .
To determine the stages of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> affected by the Ptdsrtm1Gbf mutation , timed <termsem="GO:0007618"> breedings </term> were followed by PCR genotyping ( Figure 1c ) of embryos .
We recovered fewer than the expected number of homozygous embryos from intercrosses of Ptdsr + / - mice .
From a total of 1,031 embryos analyzed between <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> day ( E ) 9.5 and E18 .5 , 198 ( 19.2 % ) Ptdsr-deficient homozygous embryos were harvested , indicating that the introduced mutation is associated with a low rate of embryonic lethality in utero .
From E9 .5 to E12 .5 , Ptdsr - / - embryos were viable and of normal size .
At E13 .5 and thereafter , however , most Ptdsr - / - embryos showed morphological abnormalities ( Table 1 ) .
All homozygous embryos harvested were <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> - retarded from E13 .5 onwards , had a pale appearance , and displayed multiple <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> dysmorphologies .
These included various head and craniofacial malformations , such as exencephaly , cleft palate and abnormal head shape ( Figure 1f , g ) .
Gross inspection revealed that <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye development </term> was severely affected in 14.1 % of homozygous embryos .
The affected animals displayed a complete unilateral or bilateral absence of the eyes ( Table 1 ) that was never detected in Ptdsr + / + or Ptdsr + / - littermates .
Furthermore , homozygous embryos harvested between E12 .5 and E15 .5 had subcutaneous edema ( Figure 1f , g ) .
Because we were able to recover Ptdsr - / - embryos until E18 .5 , we investigated whether Ptdsr-knockout mice could be <termsem="GO:0007567"> born </term> alive .
Careful observation of timed <termsem="GO:0007618"> matings </term> allowed us to recover Ptdsr - / - neonates , but homozygous pups <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> during <termsem="GO:0007567"> delivery </term> or within minutes after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Ptdsr-deficient neonates were also <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> - retarded , had a pale appearance and displayed various malformations .
These included cleft palate , abnormal head shape , absence of eyes and edematous skin ( Figure 1h ) .
Thus , deletion of the Ptdsr gene resulted in perinatal lethality with variable severity and penetrance of phenotypes .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Ptdsr during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> and in adult tissues .
The observed perinatal lethality indicates that Ptdsr plays an important role during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Analysis by <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR ( data not shown ) showed that Ptdsr is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> early in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , because we were able to detect Ptdsr transcripts in ES cells and embryos at all <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages .
To analyze in more detail the temporal and spatial <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns of Ptdsr , and to correlate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns with observed pathological malformations , we made use of a Ptdsr--geo gene-trap reporter mouse line <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> from a Ptdsr gene-trap ES cell clone .
This line has an insertion of <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> in the 3 ' region of the gene ( Figure 2a ) .
We first examined Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> by X-Gal staining in heterozygous embryos staged from E9 .5 to E12 .5 .
These <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages were chosen so as to investigate Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in affected organs prior to the onset of pathological malformations in Ptdsr - / - embryos .
At E9 .5 we found Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> neural tube , somites , heart , gut and branchial arches ( Figure 2b ) .
At E10 .5 , Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> remained high in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> nervous system , with most intense staining in the forebrain , hindbrain and neural tube .
At this stage of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , high levels of Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> could also be detected in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limb buds and eyes ( Figure 2b ) .
Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was altered at E12 .5 , with most intensive <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> staining in the eyes , <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> condensations of the limb buds , neural tube and brain ( Figure 2b ) .
Transverse sections of X-Gal-stained embryos at E12 .5 showed an asymmetric <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern in the neural tube with intense staining of the central mantle layer but no <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the dorsal part of the neural tube ( for example , the roof plate ; Figure 2c ) .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> in dorsal root ganglia lateral to the neural tube and in the somites was observed ; Ptdsr was <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the somite structure ( myotome , dermatome and sclerotome ; Figure 2d ) .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> boundaries between somites were evident , with no <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the segmental interzones , which correspond to the prospective intervertebral discs ( Figure 2d ) .
Transverse sections of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> eye at E12 .5 revealed strong Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the inner layer of the neural cup , which will later <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> into the neural retina .
Furthermore , Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was detected in the primary lens fiber cells of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> lens ( Figure 2e ) .
We carefully investigated whether Ptdsr is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> from E10 .5 to E12 .5 in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney and lungs , but no <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> could be detected indicating that Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is required only at later stages in the development of these organs ( see below ) .
<termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> Hybridization </term> </term> of a multiple-tissue northern blot revealed a single transcript of about 1.8 kb in almost every tissue analyzed in adult mice ( Figure 2f ) .
The most prominent <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was observed in testis , thymus , kidney , liver and skin , with moderate to low <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in lung , small intestine , spleen , stomach and skeletal muscle .
Thus , Ptdsr is ubiquitously <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> and in adult tissues , although at different levels .
Ptdsr is required for normal tissue and organ <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
We next examined the role of Ptdsr in <termsem="GO:0048513"> organ development </term> .
Serial histological sections of Ptdsr - / - and control embryos were taken to perform a detailed morphological analysis of all organ systems during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
A significant delay in organ and tissue <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> was observed at E16 .5 in lungs , kidneys and intestine .
Lungs of control littermates were properly <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> with <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanding </term> alveoli ( Figure 3a ) .
Terminal bronchi and bronchioles were already well <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> , and terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> epithelial cells with cilia on the luminal cell surface were present .
In contrast , almost no alveoli or bronchioles were present in Ptdsr - / - lungs , indicating a delay or arrest in lung sacculation and <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> .
Instead , we observed an abundance of mesenchyme that appeared highly immature ( Figure 3g ) .
A similar delay in tissue <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of Ptdsr - / - embryos was found in the kidneys ( Figure 3h ) .
Kidneys from Ptdsr + / + embryos were well <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> at E16 .5 , showing terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> glomeruli with Bowman 's capsule and collecting tubules lined with cuboidal epithelial cells ( Figure 3b ) .
In contrast , Ptdsr-deficient kidneys had only primitive glomeruli at E16 .5 , and collecting tubules were less well - <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> .
Instead , a large amount of undifferentiated mesenchyme was present in Ptdsr - / - kidneys ( Figure 3h ) .
A delay in tissue <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> was also found in the intestine at this stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Ptdsr - / - embryos displayed improperly <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> villi and an underdeveloped or absent submucosa ( Figure 3i ) .
In wild-type embryos ( Figure 3c ) , intestinal <termsem="GO:0030154"> cellular differentiation </term> was already highly <termsem="GO:0065007"> organized </term> , with intramural ganglion cells between the external and internal muscular layers .
Such neuronal cells were absent from the intestine of Ptdsr - / - embryos ( Figure 3i ) , however .
Some Ptdsr - / - mice ( 4.5 % ) also displayed extensive brain malformations that resulted in externally visible head abnormalities , with occasional ectopic tissue outside the skull or exencephaly ( Figure 1f , h ) .
Histological analysis revealed an extensive hyperplasia of brain tissue with herniation of brain tissue either through the skull-cap or through the ventral skull ( Figure 3d , j ) .
In the most severe cases , <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of brain tissue in mutant mice resulted in further perturbations of cortical structures ( Figure 3d , j ) .
Of note , a similar brain phenotype was observed in the Ptdsr-deficient mouse line <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by Li and colleagues [ 31 ] .
In contrast to the study of Li et al. [ 31 ] , however , we found almost normally <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> lungs at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Ptdsr - / - lungs showed , in comparison to wild-type , only a slight delay in <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and were fully ventilated in neonates in most cases ( Figure 3e , k ) .
This demonstrates that Ptdsr-deficient mice can overcome the delay in embryonic lung <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and display normal lung morphology at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Thus , it would appear highly unlikely that Ptdsr - / - mice <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> from respiratory failure .
Consistent with the observations of Kunisaki and colleagues [ 32 ] , we found severely blocked <termsem="GO:0048821"> erythropoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> at an early erythroblast stage in the liver ( Figure 3f ,3 l ) , suggesting an explanation for the grossly anemic appearance that we observed in our Ptdsr - / - mice .
Loss of Ptdsr activity is associated with defects in <termsem="GO:0001654"> ocular development </term> and can lead to <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of ectopic eye structures .
By gross morphology we could differentiate two classes of Ptdsr mutants : those that appeared normal with both eyes present ( Figure 4 ) and those that were severely affected and displayed uni - or bilateral anophthalmia ( Figure 5 ) .
Analysis of normal or mildly affected embryos revealed no differences between mutant and wild-type embryos in the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> eye until E16 .5 .
In both genotypes , inner and outer layers of the retina displayed a comparable <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> status , as shown , for example , at E12 .5 ( Figure 4a , e ) .
At day E16 .5 , however , retinal layers in Ptdsr - / - embryos were much thinner than in wild-type embryos , contained fewer cells and were greatly reduced in size ( Figure 4b , f ) .
Comparison of the retinal structures of Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - embryos revealed that all four retinal layers were present in Ptdsr-knockout mice at E16 .5 ( Figure 4b , f ) .
At E18 .5 ( Figure 4c , g ) and in neonatal animals ( postnatal day P0 ; Figure 4d , h ) , the differences in retinal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> between Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice were still evident , but the size reduction of the retinal layers was less pronounced in the knockout mice .
Ptdsr-deficient animals seem to have compensated for the marked delay in <termsem="GO:0030154"> cellular differentiation </term> and <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of retinal layers .
Close examination of retinal structures revealed that the inner granular layer was still less <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> in Ptdsr-deficient animals , however , and that it contained fewer cells and was still severely underdeveloped in comparison with the corresponding retinal layer in control animals ( Figure 4c ,4 g and 4d ,4 h ) .
Thus , even mildly affected Ptdsr - / - mutants had ocular malformations with defects in <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of retinal structures .
We next examined Ptdsr - / - embryos that displayed unilateral or bilateral absence of eyes ( Figure 5a ) by serial sectioning of whole embryos .
These embryos showed complex malformations of the optical cup , including absence of the lens ( Figure 5b ) .
Most surprisingly , we found pigmented epithelial cells in the nasal cavity of all Ptdsr-knockout mice with anophthalmia that were analyzed histopathologically .
We could identify black-colored pigmented cells embedded in the epithelium of the maxillary sinus that resembled presumptive retinal-pigmented epithelium ( Figure 5b , c ) .
Examination of consecutive serial sections revealed the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of a primitive eye structure , with <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> and subsequent proliferation of ectopic mesenchymal tissue immediately adjacent to the displaced pigmented epithelium ( Figure 5d ) .
This structure was clearly <termsem="GO:0031128"> induced </term> ectopically , and we failed to identify similar changes in any of the wild-type embryos .
In summary , we observed a wide range of ocular malformations in Ptdsr-deficient mice that ranged from <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in retinal cell layers ( for example , the inner granular layer ) in mildly affected homozygotes to anophthalmia in severely affected Ptdsr - / - mice that was associated with <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of ectopic eye structures in nasal cavities .
<termsem="GO:0006909"> Phagocytosis </term> and <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> is normal in Ptdsr-deficient mice .
We next tested whether Ptdsr is functionally required for the <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
We started with an investigation of <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> in vivo in the interdigital areas of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limbs .
Apoptosis of interdigital cells in the distal mesenchyme of limb buds occurs most prominently from <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages E12 .0 to E13 .5 and can be easily examined in situ by whole-mount <termsem="GO:0003912"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> terminal deoxynucleotide transferase </term> </term> - mediated UTP end-labeling ( TUNEL ) .
We compared the pattern of interdigital <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> in fore and hind limb buds from Ptdsr - / - ( n = 3 ) and Ptdsr + / + ( n = 3 ) mice at E12 .5 and E13 .5 .
No differences in accumulation of TUNEL-positive cell corpses were observed between the two genotypes ( Figure 6a ) .
The kinetics of <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> occurrence and <termsem="GO:0060033"> regression </term> of the interdigital web was similar in wild-type and mutant littermates , providing no evidence that Ptdsr-deficiency is associated with impaired clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> interdigital cells during <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> .
To investigate further whether <termsem="GO:0043277"> removal of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> is impaired in Ptdsr - / - mice , we stained immunohistochemically for activated <termsem="GO:0030693"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> caspase </term> </term> 3 ( aCasp3 ) and analyzed additional organs and tissues where <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> plays a crucial role in <termsem="GO:0048771"> tissue remodeling </term> during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Starting at E12 .5 , we analyzed and compared the number and distribution of aCasp3-positive cells in over 140 serial sections of three wild-type and six Ptdsr - / - embryos in consecutive and corresponding sections .
The sagittal sections were separated by 5 m , allowing a detailed analysis of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in several organs and tissues .
<termsem="GO:0048771"> Tissue restructuring </term> by <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> occurred most notably within the ventral part of the neural tube ( Figure 6b , f ) and in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> paravertebral ganglia ( Figure 6d , h ) with many <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells being present .
In these tissues Ptdsr is highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> at E12 .5 ( Figure 2c ) but we observed no difference in the number or distribution of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - embryos .
The same was true for the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney : <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells were present in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - embryos , in limited numbers , but we failed to detect any differences in the number of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells between the genotypes ( Figure 6c ,6 g ) .
Furthermore , when we continued our analysis of <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> in vivo at E16 .5 , E17 .5 and E18 .5 of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> as well as in neonatal mice , the number and distribution of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells was similar in both genotypes .
As already observed at E12 .5 , analysis of aCasp3-stained sections of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> thymus , heart , diaphragm , genital ridge , eyes and retina convincingly showed that there was no impairment in <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell removal </term> in Ptdsr - / - mice .
Moreover , because Li and colleagues [ 31 ] reported impaired <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0016265"> dead </term> cells </term> during <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> in Ptdsr-deficient mice , we examined the rate of <termsem="GO:0006917"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> induction </term> and cell clearance in our Ptdsr-knockout mice in the lung .
Analysis of aCasp3-stained lung tissue from Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice at E17 .5 and P0 demonstrated that <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> was an extremely rare event during lung <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> at this stage .
In addition , there were no differences in the number or distribution of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells in Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + mice .
Furthermore , we were unable to detect any evidence of tissue necrosis in lungs from Ptdsr-deficient mice .
In contrast to the report of Li et al. [ 31 ] , we never observed <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruitment </term> of neutrophils or other signs of pulmonary <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammation </term> at any stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in our Ptdsr-deficient mice .
To analyze whether macrophages are <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> into areas where <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> is prominent during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , we stained consecutive serial sections either with the macrophage surface marker F4/80 or with aCasp3 .
Surprisingly , there was no co-localization of macrophages with <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
In virtually all embryonic tissues , <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells and macrophages were <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> in different compartments ( Figure 6e ,6 i ; and see also Additional data file 1 , Figure S1 ) .
This suggests that at this stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> it is mainly neighboring cells that are involved in <termsem="GO:0043277"> removal of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> , rather than professional macrophages .
In summary , our analysis in vivo did not reveal any impairment in <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> in Ptdsr-deficient embryos during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and further suggests that <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells is mainly mediated by non-professional ` bystander ' cells .
To determine whether macrophages from Ptdsr-knockout mice were impaired in the efficacy of <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell uptake </term> in vitro , we performed <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> assays with fetal-liver-derived macrophages ( FLDMs ) and quantified their <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> rates .
<termsem="GO:0006909"> Phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> thymocytes was investigated at 60 , 90 and 120 minutes after addition of target cells in the absence of serum .
Analysis of <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> rates by flow cytometric analysis ( FACS ) revealed no differences in the efficacy of <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell uptake </term> between Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + macrophages and demonstrated no differences in <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell engulfment </term> between selected time points ( data not shown ) .
To re-examine and further independently validate the result of normal <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell uptake </term> by Ptdsr - / - macrophages , we performed <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> assays for 60 min and determined the percentage of macrophages that had <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells , in a total of at least 300 macrophages counted by fluorescence microscopy .
<termsem="GO:0006909"> Phagocytosed </term> , 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine - ( TAMRA - ) labeled <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells were identified as being <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> by inclusion in F4/80-labeled macrophages .
Analysis was done independently by three investigators who were not aware of macrophage genotypes ( Ptdsr - / - or Ptdsr + / + ) .
Again , no differences were found in the percentage of macrophages that had <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells ( Figure 7a , c , e ) or in the relative number of <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosed </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells per macrophage ( <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytotic </term> index ; Figure 7f ) .
Moreover , single Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be identified that had <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> even more <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> target cells than had wild-type macrophages ( Figure 7b , d ) .
Thus , Ptdsr-deficient macrophages had a normal ability to <termsem="GO:0006911"> ingest </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells and were not impaired in recognition or <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of cells that had undergone <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> .
Ptdsr-deficiency results in reduced production of pro- and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> after <termsem="GO:0042116"> macrophage stimulation </term> .
In addition to its suggested importance for <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells , it has been proposed that Ptdsr fulfils a second crucial role in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> and maintaining a non - <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> environment upon the <termsem="GO:0043654"> recognition of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> by macrophages [ 26 ] .
We therefore tested whether Ptdsr - / - macrophages were able to <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> after <termsem="GO:0043652"> ingestion of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
We examined levels of TGF-1 and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> of FLDMs with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , with and without co-culture of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
Quantification of TGF-1 and IL-10 levels after 22 hours of culture demonstrated that Ptdsr - / - macrophages were able to <termsem="GO:0046903"> secrete </term> these <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> upon <termsem="GO:0043652"> ingestion of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> , although at a slightly lower level than wild-type ( Figure 8a , b ) .
This indicates that ablation of Ptdsr function does not compromise in general the ability of macrophages to <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> <termsem="GO:0050777"> immune-suppressive </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> after recognition and <termsem="GO:0043652"> engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
To analyze whether <termsem="GO:0050729"> pro- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is affected in Ptdsr - / - macrophages , we <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulated </term> FLDMs from Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice with LPS and measured levels of tumor necrosis factor- ( TNF- ) at different time points after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> ( Figure 8c ) .
Ptdsr - / - macrophages <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> significantly less TNF- than did wild-type macrophages .
The difference in TNF- <termsem="GO:0046903"> secretion </term> was first visible after 3 h of LPS <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> and became more prominent during the course of the experiment ( for example , after 9 h and 12 h of LPS <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> ; Figure 8c ) .
To analyze whether TNF- <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> by Ptdsr - / - macrophages can be affected by <termsem="GO:0043652"> engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> , we <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulated </term> FLDMs with LPS , <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells or both .
Quantification of TNF- levels by ELISA after 22 h showed that Ptdsr-deficient macrophages <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> less TNF- after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with LPS alone , and also after double <termsem="GO:0042116"> stimulation of macrophages </term> with LPS and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells ( Figure 8d ) .
Moreover , the double <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> demonstrated that the LPS-induced TNF- <termsem="GO:0046903"> release </term> by Ptdsr - / - macrophages could be inhibited by co-administration of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells to an extent comparable to that seen in wild-type macrophages .
Similar results were obtained when other <termsem="GO:0050729"> pro- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> , such as interleukin-6 and monocyte <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> chemoattractant </term> </term> protein-1 , were analyzed ( data not shown ) .
These results indicate that Ptdsr is not required in macrophages for the inhibition of <termsem="GO:0050729"> pro- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> after recognition and <termsem="GO:0043652"> engulfment of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
Ptdsr-deficiency does , however , affect the overall release of pro- and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with LPS and after double treatment with LPS and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells , indicating that Ptdsr-deficient macrophages have a reduced capacity to <termsem="GO:0009058"> produce </term> or <termsem="GO:0046903"> secrete </term> pro- and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> .
Ptdsr is required for the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of multiple organ systems during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
In this study , we have generated a null mutation in the phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> ( Ptdsr ) gene in C57BL/6J mice .
We show that ablation of Ptdsr results in profound <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in multiple organs and tissues during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , although with variable penetrance .
While this work was in progress , two other groups reported the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of Ptdsr-deficient mice [ 31,32 ] .
In all three knockout mouse lines , the first two exons ( [ 31 ] and this study ) or exons one to three [ 32 ] were deleted by replacement with a neomycin-selection cassette .
The Ptdsr-knockout mouse lines differ in the genetic background in which the mutation was generated and maintained , however .
In our case , the Ptdsr-null allele was <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> in an isogenic C57BL/6J background , whereas Li et al. [ 31 ] and Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] investigated the phenotype of their Ptdsr-knockout mice in a mixed 129  C57BL/6 background .
The ablation of Ptdsr function results in perinatal lethality in all cases , but there are interesting differences in severity or expressivities of phenotypes among the different Ptdsr-deficient mouse lines .
This might be due either to differences in genetic background or because the phenotypes that have been investigated in this study have not been analyzed in such detail before .
In the Ptdsr-knockout mouse line reported here , <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation started from E12 .5 onwards and was associated with delayed <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in several organs in which Ptdsr is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> either during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> or later in adulthood .
At E16 .5 almost no <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> of the lung epithelium was observed in Ptdsr - / - lungs .
Similarly , epithelial structures were only partially <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> in mutant kidneys , without terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of Bowman 's capsule and with a severe reduction in the number of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> collecting tubules .
Likewise , the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of the intestine was also severely delayed at this <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stage .
When compared with wild-type controls , intestinal tissues of Ptdsr knockout mice appeared unstructured , with an absence of enteric ganglia and of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> smooth muscle tissue .
Interestingly , defects in kidney and intestine <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> were not described in the Ptdsr-knockouts <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by Li et al. [ 31 ] and Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] .
Surprisingly , when we examined Ptdsr - / - embryos shortly before <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( E18 .5 ) or neonatally , we found only mild <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> delays in organs that appeared severely affected at mid - <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> .
This ` recovery ' was most visible in Ptdsr - / - lungs : at P0 we found <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> lungs in the knockout mice that showed normal <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> patterns , with <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> alveoli and bronchioles .
We investigated the occurrence of <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> during <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> in wild-type and Ptdsr-knockout mice throughout <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> ( E16 .5 to P0 ) .
Comparative immunohistochemistry for aCasp3 revealed that <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> is a rare event during lung <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> .
Furthermore , we failed to detect any differences in the number of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells in Ptdsr-knockout and wild-type animals in the rare cases where we could detect <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells within lung tissues .
These findings are contrary to the results reported by Li et al. [ 31 ] , who suggested that impaired clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> mesenchymal and epithelial cells causes a failure in lung <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> in Ptdsr-deficient mice .
In contrast , our findings are in line with the current view on <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> .
Accordingly , formation of the epithelial lung via <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> can be subdivided into a series of sequential steps that involve : first , <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the organ anlage in the form of a placode ; second , primary bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> by placode invagination ; third , branch initiation and branch outgrowth ; fourth , further reiteration of the <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching process </term> ; and fifth , terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of organ-specific proximal and distal structures [ 34,35 ] .
In contrast to other invagination processes during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , such as <termsem="GO:0030879"> mammary gland formation </term> , the lumen of the lungs is <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> by successive <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching events </term> , branch outgrowth and elongation , rather than by <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> [ 34,36 ] .
Finally , because the lungs of Ptdsr - / - neonates were almost fully <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> and appeared normal in structure in comparison to wild-type littermates , it is highly unlikely that Ptdsr mutants <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> of respiratory lung failure .
In addition , Li and colleagues [ 31 ] demonstrated that surfactant <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is normal in Ptdsr-deficient animals , supporting the idea of normal maturation of surfactant - <termsem="GO:0009058"> producing </term> type II alveolar epithelial cells and lung function .
Other defects must therefore be responsible for the <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> of Ptdsr-mutant mice .
The frequently observed subcutaneous edema of various extents in Ptdsr-deficient homozygotes gave us a hint that Ptdsr-deficiency and lethality might be associated with cardiovascular problems .
Indeed , very recently we have obtained strong evidence that Ptdsr-knockout mice <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> as a result of defects in <termsem="GO:0007507"> heart development </term> that are associated with specific cardiopulmonary malformations ; ( J.E. Schneider , J.B. , S.D. Bamfort , A.D.G. , C. Broadbent , K. Clarke , S. Neubauer , A.L. and S. Battacharya , unpublished observations ) .
In addition , we demonstrate that <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye development </term> requires a functional Ptdsr gene .
Ptdsr-deficient embryos can be roughly divided into two categories .
The first , severely affected group develops anophthalmia that correlates with <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of ectopic retinal-pigmented epithelium and <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of proliferation of underlying mesenchyme in the nasal cavity .
This phenotype represents a completely novel lesion that to our knowledge has not been described before in any other mouse mutant .
The second group shows normal external eye structures , although in this case <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> is temporally delayed during mid - <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> , with persistent , abnormal <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> of the inner granular retinal layer at later stages of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> .
A possible explanation for these two phenotypes can be found in the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern of the Ptdsr gene .
Initially , Ptdsr is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the whole <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> nervous system , with exceptionally high levels in the anterior part of the forebrain .
Later <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> becomes more restricted to the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> retina and lens .
Thus , Ptdsr might play an important role in early events of <termsem="GO:0048592"> ocular morphogenesis </term> , such as <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishment </term> and bisection of eye fields and <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of optic cups .
These early <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye-formation </term> steps are closely interconnected with development of the forebrain [ 37,38 ] and the nose [ 39-41 ] .
Interestingly , we occasionally observed serious malformations of forebrain and nasal structures in Ptdsr-knockout embryos that were associated with bilateral anophthalmia ( see for example the mutant embryo in Figure 1g ) .
This suggests that Ptdsr is involved in the <termsem="GO:0045595"> regulation of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation processes </term> </term> within forebrain regions , and that ablation of Ptdsr function might secondarily affect early <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye formation </term> .
Li et al. [ 31 ] found smaller lenses in Ptdsr-knockout mice and described the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of retinal protrusions , although anophthalmia and specific <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects of retinal cell layers were not reported in their study .
Li et al. proposed [ 31 ] that the eye phenotype they observed could be explained by failed <termsem="GO:0043277"> removal of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> during <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye development </term> , but we think that the observed defects are unrelated to a failure of <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> .
A recent comprehensive kinetic analysis of <termsem="GO:0006917"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> induction </term> during mouse <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> described four major peaks of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic cell death </term> [ 42 ] .
This study demonstrated that there is an initial phase of <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> during the invagination of the optic cup ( E10 .5 ) , followed by subsequent waves of <termsem="GO:0006917"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> induction </term> immediately before and after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( E18 .5 to postnatal day P2 ) , and from postnatal days P9 to P10 and P14 to P16 [ 42 ] .
Thus , besides the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the inner and outer layers of the optic cup in early <termsem="GO:0001654"> eye development </term> , other major phases of retinal <termsem="GO:0006915"> cell apoptosis </term> take place only postnatally and correspond to important periods in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishment </term> of neuronal connections .
Furthermore , <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> during normal <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> occurs in retinal layers distinct from the inner granular layer where we observed the most pronounced <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in the Ptdsr - / - mutants described here .
Other studies that connect the postnatal elimination of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> photoreceptor cells to Ptdsr-mediated macrophage <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfment </term> [ 43 ] should be interpreted with extreme caution as these studies were based on the monoclonal anti-Ptdsr antibody mAb 217G8E9 [ 26,43 ] ( see below ) .
Consistent with the results of Li et al. [ 31 ] , we found particular brain malformations in our Ptdsr - / - mice .
Exencephaly and hyperplastic brain phenotypes were observed at a low penetrance in Ptdsr-mutant mice ( less then 4.5 % of homozygotes ) , but these do not resemble to any extent the brain-overgrowth phenotypes of <termsem="GO:0030693"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> caspase </term> </term> - or Apaf1-knockout mice ( [ 44 ] , and references therein ) in that we failed to identify any differences in the number or distribution of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells or <termsem="GO:0030263"> pyknotic </term> cell clusters in the neuroepithelium of Ptdsr - / - and Ptdsr + / + mice .
Thus , reduced <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> or diminished clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> neural progenitor cells is unlikely to be the cause of the brain hyperplasia .
In summary , our studies demonstrate that Ptdsr is required for normal tissue <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , especially during the mid - <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> period when we observed the most severe <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> delays in several organs of Ptdsr-knockout mice .
The multiple defects in tissue <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> can not be explained by failure of <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> , as this process is normal in our Ptdsr-knockout line .
This result therefore indicates that Ptdsr has a novel , hitherto unexpected , role in <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> tissue <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Additional studies with conditionally targeted Ptdsr-deficient mice are required to investigate the role of spatial and temporal Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and function during tissue <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Ptdsr is not essential for the <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
Our studies demonstrate that Ptdsr is not a primary <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> for the <termsem="GO:0043652"> uptake of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> .
Investigation of <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> in vivo in Ptdsr - / - embryos conclusively showed that <termsem="GO:0043277"> removal of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> is not compromised by ablation of Ptdsr function .
Comparative analysis of ten different tissues and organs in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - animals at several stages of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> and in neonates failed to identify impaired <termsem="GO:0043652"> uptake of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> at any time during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Furthermore , <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> assays in vitro demonstrated a completely normal <termsem="GO:0043652"> uptake of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> by Ptdsr - / - macrophages , with some knockout macrophages showing loads even higher than wild-type of <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> <termsem="GO:0016265"> dead </term> cells .
These results are contrary to the expected role of Ptdsr in <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> and to the reported findings of Li et al. [ 31 ] and Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] , as well as to a study done with a phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> null allele in C. elegans [ 45 ] .
In previous studies in the mouse , the distribution and amount of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells in Ptdsr-knockout and control animals were investigated in only a few tissues and at one [ 31 ] or two [ 32 ] <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages .
Li et al. [ 31 ] examined lung , midbrain and retina at day E17 .5 of <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> and identified <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells by TUNEL staining .
Their findings must be interpreted with caution because <termsem="GO:0048771"> remodeling </term> of cellular structures by <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in specific retina layers is known to occur mainly postnatally [ 42 ] , and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> plays an important physiological role in the maintenance and <termsem="GO:0042592"> homeostasis </term> of lung epithelium after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> or in pathological conditions involving pulmonary <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammation </term> and not during <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> [ 46 ] .
This postnatal role for <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> is in accordance with our data , as we rarely observed <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells in retina or lung tissue throughout <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> in Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - mice .
Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] analyzed TUNEL-stained sections of liver and thymus at days E13 .5 and E16 .5 of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in Ptdsr + / - and Ptdsr - / - embryos and found reduced rather than increased numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in Ptdsr-deficient embryos .
Using co-localization of TUNEL-positive cells with F4/80-positive macrophages they suggested that Ptdsr - / - embryos exhibited a three-fold increase in the frequency of unphagocytosed TUNEL-positive cells together with a severely reduced number of F4/80-positive cells .
These results must be interpreted very carefully , however , as it is technically difficult to unambiguously identify <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> target cells in individual macrophages in solid tissues by fluorescence microscopy .
In addition , our data suggest that during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , macrophage-mediated <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> is not the only - or even the primary - mechanism for the removal of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
In many tissues where <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> occurs as a prominent event during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , such as <termsem="GO:0048771"> remodeling </term> of the genital ridge during <termsem="GO:0035262"> gonad morphogenesis </term> and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of the neural tube , we found almost no co-localization of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells and macrophages .
This indicates that in these cases <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> is directly mediated by neighboring ` bystander ' cells rather than by macrophages that have been <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> into areas where <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> occurs .
Obviously these in vivo clearance mechanisms are not compromised by Ptdsr-deficiency in our knockout mutant .
This finding is in line with studies in macrophageless Sfpi1-knockout embryos that are deficient for the <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> - lineage-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> PU .1 .
Here , the <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> is taken over by ` stand-in ' mesenchymal neighbors [ 47 ] .
As <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognition </term> of phosphatidylserine is thought to be a universal <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfment mechanism </term> for all cells that are able to <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytose </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells , it is very striking that <termsem="GO:0043277"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell clearance </term> mediated by non-professional bystander cells is also not compromised by Ptdsr-deficiency .
In contrast to Li et al. [ 31 ] , we did not observe any impairment in the <termsem="GO:0043652"> uptake of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> by Ptdsr - / - macrophages in vitro .
We performed <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> assays in vitro with fetal-liver-derived macrophages , while in their assays , Li and colleagues used thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages after adoptive transfer of Ptdsr - / - <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> stem cells .
The different results obtained in the two studies are puzzling ; they might be due to the use of different macrophage or cell populations .
We and Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] found that Ptdsr-deficiency is to some extent associated with defects in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> .
Thus , it seems possible that <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruitment </term> and activation / <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of macrophages after adoptive transfer and thioglycollate elicitation are affected by Ptdsr-deficiency .
We do not think that the different results observed in Ptdsr-knockout mice in a mixed C57BL/6  129 background and in a pure C57BL/6J background can be attributed to genetic background effects : comparison of <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell engulfment </term> efficacies of thioglycollate-elicited macrophages from 129P2/OlaHsd and C57BL/6J mice did not show any differences in <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell uptake </term> ( J.B. and A.L. , unpublished observations ) .
Moreover , in contrast to our studies , neither Li et al. [ 31 ] nor Kunisaki et al. [ 32 ] determined <termsem="GO:0006911"> <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytotic </term> engulfment </term> indexes for Ptdsr-deficient macrophages .
Interestingly , we observed differences between Ptdsr + / + and Ptdsr - / - macrophages in the secretion of pro- and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokines </term> </term> after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with LPS and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells .
This provides evidence that <termsem="GO:0001775"> cellular activation </term> and <termsem="GO:0002252"> effector mechanisms </term> are impaired in Ptdsr-deleted macrophages .
It remains to be determined which classical <termsem="GO:0042116"> pathways of macrophage activation </term> and function involve Ptdsr .
This is especially important in light of recent findings that demonstrated nuclear localization of the Ptdsr protein [ 29 ] .
Most strikingly , the recently published data regarding the genetic ablation or perturbation of phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> function in C. elegans are also contradictory .
Wang et al. [ 45 ] reported that psr-1 , the C. elegans homolog of Ptdsr , is important for <termsem="GO:0043652"> cell-corpse engulfment </term> , whereas psr-1 <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> studies performed by Arur et al. [ 25 ] yielded , in this respect , no phenotype .
Moreover , Wang and colleagues hypothesized on the basis of their data that psr-1 might act to <termsem="GO:0007165"> transduce </term> an <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfment </term> signal upstream of Ced-2 ( Crk II ) , Ced-5 ( Dock 180 ) , Ced-10 ( Rac 1 ) and Ced-12 ( Elmo ) in one of the two <termsem="GO:0043652"> cell-corpse engulfment pathways </term> in the worm [ 45 ] .
But the loss-of-function phenotype of psr-1 mutants and the complementation phenotypes in overexpressing transgenic worms shown by Wang et al. [ 45 ] are rather weak as compared to the classical C. elegans <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfment </term> mutants [ 8 ] .
Many previous functional studies that reported a requirement for Ptdsr for the <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells used the monoclonal anti-Ptdsr antibody mAb 217G8E9 [ 26 ] .
This antibody was used in Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> and blocking experiments , as well as in <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> studies , which led to the conclusion that Ptdsr is a <termsem="GO:0004888"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transmembrane receptor </term> </term> critical for <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal transduction </term> at the <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfment </term> interface .
More recently it was used in <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> assays to show that the human and worm Ptdsr molecules can <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognize </term> phosphatidylserine [ 45 ] .
In the course of the study presented here , we stained immunohistochemically for Ptdsr with mAb 217G8E9 on wild-type and Ptdsr-deficient macrophages and fibroblasts ( see Additional data file 1 , Figure S2 and data not shown ) .
To our surprise , we observed similar staining patterns with cells of both genotypes .
Furthermore , using a Ptdsr-peptide array we found that mAb 217G8E9 can <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> weakly to a Ptdsr peptide , explaining the original isolation of Ptdsr cDNA clones by phage display [ 26 ] ; but the antibody mainly <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognizes </term> additional , as-yet unknown , membrane-associated protein ( s ) ( see Additional data file 1 , Figure S2 ) .
Experiments that have used this antibody should therefore be interpreted with great caution as they might come to be viewed in a different light .
Our results demonstrate that Ptdsr is essential for the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> of multiple tissues during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> .
Ablation of Ptdsr function results in neonatal lethality and severe defects in the morphogenesis of several organs .
The <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> malformations can not be explained by impaired <termsem="GO:0043277"> clearance of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> , a process that proved to be normal in Ptdsr-deficient mice .
This opens up the possibility either that there is an as-yet unknown Ptdsr <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , which might act as a primary phosphatidylserine <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognition </term> <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , or that <termsem="GO:0008037"> recognition </term> of phosphatidylserine and subsequent <termsem="GO:0043652"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell engulfment </term> and <termsem="GO:0050728"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammatory </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> are mainly mediated through phosphatidylserine bridging proteins and their cognate <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> .
Although Ptdsr - / - macrophages were not impaired in their ability to <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytose </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells , they showed reduced <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokine </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> after <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> .
Further work will be required to determine the molecular mechanisms of these newly recognized Ptdsr functions during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
<termsem="GO:0009058"> Construction </term> of the targeting vector and <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of Ptdsr-knockout and gene-trap mice .
A Ptdsr-containing bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) clone ( GenBank accession number AC091694 ; RP-23-316F3 ) was isolated by sequence homology from a C57BL/6J genomic BAC library ( RP-23 ; BACPAC Resources , Oakland , USA ) .
A 14.5 kb KpnI/BamHI fragment containing the entire Ptdsr locus and 5 ' and 3 ' flanking regions was subcloned from this BAC clone and a 1.9 kb RsrII/AatII fragment containing exons I and II of the Ptdsr gene was replaced by a 1.2 kb loxP-flanked neomycin-resistance gene cassette ( <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> ) .
Homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in ES cells and <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of germ-line chimeras .
Bruce4 ES cells were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with KpnI-linearized targeting vector and selected with G418 .
ES-cell clones resistant to G418 were isolated and analyzed by Southern blot analysis for homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination events </term> within the Ptdsr locus .
Chimeric mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> produced </term> by microinjection of two independent homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> ( Ptdsr + / - ) ES cells into BALB/c blastocysts and transfer to pseudopregnant foster mothers followed by <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> to term .
Chimeric males were <termsem="GO:0007618"> mated </term> with C57BL/6J females .
From the two selected ES-cell clones , one successfully contributed to the germ-line .
Germ-line transmission of the mutant allele was verified by PCR and Southern blot of genomic DNA from black coat-color F1 offspring .
Ptdsr gene-trap and <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of germ-line chimeras .
An ES-cell line carrying a -geo gene-trap vector in the Ptdsr locus was identified by searching the BayGenomics database ( BayGenomics , San Francisco , USA ; [ 48 ] ) with the full-length Ptdsr cDNA .
A single ES-cell line was identified carrying the gene-trap in intron V , between exons V and VI of the Ptdsr gene .
Chimeric mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by microinjection into CB20 blastocysts and transfer to pseudopregnant foster mothers .
Chimeric males were <termsem="GO:0000003"> mated </term> with 129P2/OlaHsd females .
Germ-line transmission of the mutant gene-trap allele was verified by <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> analysis using <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> staining and <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR .
The genotypes of embryos or animals were determined by PCR analysis and confirmed by Southern blot .
Genomic DNA for PCR was prepared from extraembryonic membranes or tail clips using a non-organic tail-DNA extraction protocol [ 49 ] .
High molecular weight genomic DNA for Southern blotting was prepared according to standard protocols .
For PCR analysis the wild-type Ptdsr allele was detected using forward primer 1 ( 5 ' - GACACTGTCCATGGCAAACAC-3 ' ) and reverse primer 2 ( 5 ' - TAAAGTCGCCTTCCAGAAGATT-3 ' ) .
The primer 1 site is located 5 ' to the deletion and the primer 2 site within the deletion .
This primer pair amplified a fragment of approximately 300 bp from wild-type and Ptdsr + / - mice but not from Ptdsr - / - mutants .
To detect the mutant Ptdsr allele , genomic DNA was also amplified using primer 1 and reverse primer 3 ( 5 ' - CCACACGCGTCACCTTAATA-3 ' ) , which corresponds to a sequence in the <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> cassette .
In this case , a 500 bp fragment was detected in mice heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele , while no signal was detected in wild-type mice .
For Southern blot analysis , genomic DNA ( 30 g ) was <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> overnight with BamHI ( 30 U ; Roche Diagnostics GmbH , Mannheim , Germany ) and ScaI ( 30 U ; Roche ) , fractionated on a 0.8 % agarose gel , transferred to a nylon membrane ( Hybond N ; Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH , Freiburg , Germany ) and <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> with 5 ' and 3 ' flanking probes .
The BamHI digest was <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> with a Ptdsr-specific 5 ' flanking probe , and Southern blot gave a single 17.2 kb band for wild-type ( + / + ) , an 11.6 kb band for homozygous ( - / - ) and both bands for heterozygous ( + / - ) mice .
The ScaI digest was <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> using a 3 ' flanking probe , and Southern blot gave a single 12.4 kb band for wild-type , a 17.2 kb band for homozygous and both bands for heterozygous mice .
Total RNA was isolated from homogenized embryos using TRIZOL reagent ( Invitrogen GmbH , Karlsruhe , Germany ) .
For northern blots , either total RNA ( 30 g ) was extracted from embryos , electrophoresed and transferred to a nylon membrane ( Hybond N ; Amersham ) or a polyA + RNA northern blot ( OriGene Technologies Inc. , Rockville , USA ) was <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> using as the probe a Ptdsr fragment amplified from wild-type cDNA using forward primer 5 ' - GTTCCAGCTCGTCAGACTCG-3 ' and reverse primer 5 ' - TGCCCCTAAGACATGACCAC-3 ' .
In all experiments the same membrane was re - <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> with a -actin probe ( OriGene ) to confirm that equivalent RNA levels were present in each lane .
Northern blotting indicated that homozygous mutant embryos did not <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Ptdsr mRNA and heterozygous mutant embryos <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> only reduced amounts of Ptdsr mRNA .
Embryos ( E13 .5 ) for protein isolation were homogenized in <termsem="GO:0019835"> lysis </term> buffer containing 1  PBS , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % SDS and <termsem="GO:0030414"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> inhibitor </term> </term> cocktail ( CompleteMini ; Roche ) .
Equal amounts ( 25 g ) of protein lysate were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF membrane ( Millipore , Billerica , USA ) according to standard protocols .
Western blots were done using a specific antibody to Ptdsr ( PSR N-20 , sc-11632 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. , Santa Cruz , USA ) and -actin ( ab-6276 ; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) as described by the supplier .
Secondary antibodies <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> to horseradish <termsem="GO:0004601"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> peroxidase </term> </term> were from Santa Cruz and Abcam , used as described by the supplier , and detection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence system ( ECLPlus ; Amersham ) .
Wild-type C57BL/6J and 129P2/OlaHsd mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , USA ) and Harlan UK ( Bicester , UK ) , respectively .
All mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a specific pathogen-free environment with a 12 h light-dark cycle and were <termsem="GO:0007631"> fed </term> a regular unrestricted diet .
The GBF 's routine surveillance program screened for selected pathogens .
The Ptdsrtm1Gbf mutant was crossed to C57BL/6J mice to <termsem="GO:0000003"> establish </term> the co-isogenic C57BL/6J-Ptdsrtm 1Gbf mouse line .
All studies were approved by the appropriate authorities .
Heterozygous male and female mice were intercrossed in order to obtain Ptdsr-deficient progeny .
Females were daily monitored for vaginal plugs , and noon of the day of plug detection was defined as E0 .5 .
Embryos at indicated time points were dissected in sterile PBS , washed in ice-cold PBS and transferred to cold fixative .
Extra-embryonic membranes were kept and used for genotyping .
Ptdsr - / - embryos and their wild-type littermates were used for experiments .
Histology , TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry .
Embryos for histology and immunohistochemistry were harvested and fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin , dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol , embedded in paraffin , sagittally sectioned at 5 m intervals , and every fifth section was processed for hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining according to standard protocols .
Remaining sections of wild-type and Ptdsr - / - specimens were used for immunohistochemistry .
For detection of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells and macrophages , anti-aCasp3 ( an antibody specific for activated <termsem="GO:0030693"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> caspase </term> </term> 3 ; R&D Systems , Minneapolis , USA ) and anti-F4 / 80 ( Serotec GmBH , Dsseldorf , Germany ; #MCA 1957 ) antibodies were used as described by the supplier .
Detection was performed using indirect streptavidin with <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylated </term> secondary antibodies and cobalt-enhanced diaminobenzidine ( brown ) or fast-red ( red ) as chromogens .
Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin .
For whole-mount <termsem="GO:0003912"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase </term> </term> - mediated UTP end labeling ( TUNEL ) , limb buds were dissected from E12 .5 and E13 .5 embryos , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and processed for analysis as previously described [ 50 ] .
Preparation of fetal liver-derived macrophages ( FLDMs ) .
Fetal livers were excised from embryos at E12 .5 and E13 .5 , respectively , washed in PBS and dissociated enzymatically for 60 min at 37 C .
The <termsem="GO:0009056"> digestion </term> buffer ( 150 l per liver ) comprised 0.6 U/ml dispase I ( Roche ) , 0.1 % <termsem="GO:0008133"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> collagenase </term> </term> D ( Roche ) , 10 U <termsem="GO:0004536"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase </term> </term> ( Roche ) , and 20 % FCS in PBS .
X-Vivo 15 medium ( Cambrex , East Rutherford , USA ) was added to the resulting cell suspension , and after centrifugation ( 200  g ; 3 min ) cells were resuspended in X-Vivo 15 medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml macrophage colony - <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulating </term> factor ( M-CSF ; Sigma-Aldrich , St. Louis , USA ) and cultured on non-treated tissue-culture dishes at 37 C with 5 % CO2 .
Every second or third day the medium was changed by centrifugation .
Following withdrawal of M-CSF on day 6 after excision , <termsem="GO:0022610"> adherent </term> cells were cultured for an additional 24-48 h in X-Vivo 15 medium .
Macrophage <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> assays .
For preparation of monolayer cultures of macrophages , FLDMs were plated on glass coverslips in 24 well plates ( 2  105 cells per well ) in X-Vivo 15 medium .
For preparation of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> target cells , primary thymocytes were harvested from the thymus of 4 - to 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice , stained with TAMRA for 15 min , and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> was induced either by treating cells with 5 M staurosporine in medium for 4 h at 37 C or by culturing cells in medium overnight .
The efficacy of <termsem="GO:0006917"> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> induction </term> was compared in thymic target cells and controls by FACS analysis .
On average , 60 % of the cells of the resulting population were <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> , with exposed PS on their surface , and less than 5 % of the cells were necrotic , as confirmed by FITC-annexin V and propidium iodide staining .
The <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> thymocytes obtained were washed with PBS and added to the prepared FLDM cultures ( ratio 10:1 ) .
<termsem="GO:0006909"> Phagocytosis </term> was then allowed to proceed at 37 C and 5 % CO2 .
After the indicated time periods , the <termsem="GO:0043652"> uptake of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells </term> by FLDMs was stopped by intensive washing of co-cultures with cold PBS to remove unphagocytosed cells .
To measure <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> of <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> thymocytes , macrophages were further processed for immunofluorescence analysis .
Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , blocked in 0.5 % BSA/PBS and stained with an anti-F4 / 80 antibody ( Serotec ) followed by a secondary antibody <termsem="GO:0043412"> coupled </term> to Alexa 488 ( Molecular Probes Inc. , Eugene , USA ) .
Coverslips were mounted on slides and <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> thymocytes were enumerated by fluorescence microscopy .
The percentage of <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytosis </term> was calculated by counting at least 300 macrophages and determining the number of macrophages that had <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> thymocytes .
The <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytotic </term> index was calculated according to the following formula : <termsem="GO:0006909"> phagocytotic </term> index = ( total number of <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> cells/total number of counted macrophages )  ( number of macrophages containing <termsem="GO:0006911"> engulfed </term> cells/total number of counted macrophages )  100 .
The experiments were performed at least three times , each time in triplicate , and the counting was done by three different investigators .
Measurement of macrophage <termsem="GO:0001816"> <termsem="GO:0042089"> <termsem="GO:0005125"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytokine </term> </term> production </term> </term> .
Monolayer cultures of FLDMs and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> thymocytes were prepared as described above .
FLDMs were incubated with medium , LPS ( 10 ng/ml ) , <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells ( ratio 1:10 ) or both for the determination of IL-10 , TGF-1 or TNF- levels after co-culture for 22 h. For TNF- quantification at various time points , FLDMs were cultured with a high concentration of LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) .
Culture supernatants were harvested and TNF- ( Mouse TNF- OptEIA set ; BD Biosciences , Heidelberg , Germany ) and TGF-1 ( Quantikine , TGF-1 immunoassay ; R&D Systems ) were measured by ELISA as described by the supplier .
IL-10 in culture supernatants was determined by a cytometric bead assay ( Mouse <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammation </term> CBA ; BD Biosciences ) as indicated in the manual .
Data are presented as mean  SEM from at least three independent experiments , each carried out in triplicate .
Analysis of the results used the Wilcoxon-signed rank test ; p values below 0.05 were considered significant .
