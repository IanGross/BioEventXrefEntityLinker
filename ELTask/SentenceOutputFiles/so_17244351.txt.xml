Combining global <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> and transcriptome approaches to identify the candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait loci </term> in collagen-induced arthritis .
Quantitative traits such as complex diseases are controlled by many small-effect <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that are difficult to identify .
Here we present a novel strategy to identify the candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait loci </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ) in collagen induced arthritis ( CIA ) using global <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> and transcriptome approaches .
First , we performed <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> linkage analysis in F2 progeny of the CIA susceptible and resistant strains to search for small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
Second , we detected <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression patterns of both strains during CIA .
The candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified using three criteria : they are located in a <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> linked to CIA ; they are disease-specific differentially expressed during CIA ; and they are strain-specific differentially expressed regarding the two parental strains .
Eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> controlling CIA severity were identified .
Of 22,000 screened <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , 117 were both strain-specific and disease-specific differentially expressed during CIA .
Of these 117 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , 21 were located inside the support <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> of the 8 small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> and thus were considered as candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Susceptibility to most complex diseases is controlled by many <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , each having a small effect on the disease .
One example is rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , a common complex multifactorial autoimmune disease .
Several studies have been carried out to detect the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> basis of RA , and more than 30 <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> have shown evidence of linkage to the disease .
Most of these <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> did not reach a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide significant threshold value of linkage , with P values between 0.05 and 0.001 [ 1-5 ] .
Thus , these <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> only have a small effect on RA .
Small <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> contributions could also be seen from the susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of RA identified so far , including HLA-DR4 , PADI4 , PTPN22 and FCRL3 [ 6-9 ] .
Except for HLA-DR4 , which is strongly associated with RA , all the other susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have only a small effect on the disease .
In the mouse model of RA , small <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> contributions are also often observed .
For example , in a previous study , we carried out a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> screen to identify the <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait loci </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ) in collagen-induced arthritis ( CIA ) , which is a widely used animal model of RA .
Only one <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , Cia2 , was identified for the phenotype of CIA severity , but this <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> contributes to only 16 % of the phenotype variations for CIA susceptibility in F2 progeny [ 10 ] .
This suggests that there must be other susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> whose contributions were not big enough to reach the stringent significance threshold value of linkage analysis .
One aim of using animal models for complex diseases is to detect the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> basis of these diseases .
With controllable environmental factors as well as the <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background , animal models are powerful tools to search for susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for complex diseases , and have been intensively employed for that purpose .
More than 27,000 <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> have been identified in the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> since the first <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> was identified at the beginning of the 1990s [ 11 ] .
By 2005 , approximately 20 quantitative trait <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( QTGs ) in the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> had been identified [ 12,13 ] .
Interestingly , most QTGs identified in animal models have the causal <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> in the <termsem="SO:0000010"> protein - <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding </term> region </term> [ 14 ] , which provoke protein structure changes or protein deficiency .
This suggests , on the one hand , that small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> are difficult to identify with traditional strategies and , on the other hand , that the <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> regulating <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression might only slightly affect the quantitative traits , and thus are more difficult to identify .
Microarray-based global <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression is a powerful technique for investigating complex diseases .
During disease development , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in the disease are likely to be differentially regulated .
Therefore , signature <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of the diseases could be identified by detecting the expression patterns of the disease-related cells/tissues and their ideal controls .
In the past decade , many studies applied this technique to study both RA and its animal models [ 15-22 ] .
Indeed , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in arthritis show distinct expression patterns in certain tissues and pathological stages of the disease .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genes </term> involved in immunoinflammatory responses were differentially expressed in the blood cells in RA patients [ 18 ] .
Chemokines and adhesion molecules were upregulated in the joint at the initiation phase of arthritis in animal models [ 21,22 ] , while <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in cartilage destruction and bone erosion were differentially expressed at the late phase of arthritis in animal models of RA [ 15,16 ] .
Besides detecting <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in complex diseases , microarrays could also be used to detect the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> regulating <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression because differential expressions between two strains might be the result of a <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> located in <termsem="SO:0005836"> regulatory elements </term> .
To identify the small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> of CIA as well as the potential candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> inside them , we investigated CIA <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> susceptible and resistant strains at both the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> and transcriptome levels .
At the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> level , F2 progeny of the CIA susceptible ( DBA/1 ) and resistant ( FVB/N ) strains were generated and a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide linkage analysis was performed to identify small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
At the transcriptome level , we detected the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression patterns of both the DBA/1 and FVB/N strains at four different phases of CIA .
The potential candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified based on three criteria : they are located within the <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> linked to CIA ; they are disease-specific differentially expressed during CIA ; and they are strain-specific differentially expressed between the two parental strains during CIA .
Animals , immunisation and assessment of arthritis .
Both DBA/1 and FVB/N mice used in this study were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and kept in a climate-controlled environment with 12 hour light/dark cycles in the animal facility at the University of Rostock .
All animal experiments were pre-approved by the State Animal Care Committee .
CIA was induced in control and experimental animals according to established protocols described previously [ 10 ] .
In brief , DBA/1J , FVB/N and ( DBA/1J  FVB/N ) F2 progeny were immunised at 8 to 12 weeks at the base of the tail with 125 g of bovine Collagen II ( Chondrex , Redmond , WA , USA ) emulsified in CFA ( DIFCO , Detroit , MI , USA ) .
The clinical scoring of arthritis commenced 18 days after immunisation , and animals were monitored three times weekly for signs of CIA .
Arthritis development was monitored in all four limbs using a three-score system per limb as described previously [ 10 ] .
Eight-week old FVB/N and DBA/1J mice were used for the detection of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression .
They were divided into four experimental groups according to the different phases of CIA , namely naive control ( NC ) , post-immunisation ( PI ) , onset of arthritis ( OA ) and chronic arthritis ( CA ) ( Table 1 ) .
The NC group contained non-immunised mice that were sacrificed at the age of 8 weeks .
The mice in the PI group were sacrificed on day 10 after immunisation .
The mice in the OA group were sacrificed on day 35 after immunisation .
Three FVB/N non-arthritic mice and three DBA/1 mice that showed signs of arthritis on day 33 or 34 after immunisation were sacrificed on day 35 after immunisation .
The mice in the CA group were sacrificed on day 95 after immunisation .
Three non-arthritic FVB/N mice and three DBA/1 mice that had developed arthritis for at least two months were sacrificed on day 95 after immunisation .
Detailed information on genotyping of the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> screen has been described previously [ 10 ] .
In short , we genotyped 290 F2 mice using 126 informative <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellite markers </term> covering the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> with an average inter-marker distance of 11.5 cM for 290 F2 progeny .
All linkage analyses were performed with QTX Map manager software [ 23 ] .
The main clinical phenotype of CIA , arthritis severity , was taken as phenotype .
To detect the small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , the threshold value of linkage was set as P = 0.05 ( Chi-square test ) .
Sample preparation and microarray hybridisation .
Lymph nodes ( LNs ) draining the immunisation site were used for total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> preparation .
The total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> was extracted from the tissue homogenates using a commercial kit in accordance with the provided protocol ( QIGEN , Hilden , Germany ) .
Analysis of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression was conducted using a U430A array ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) interrogating more than 22,000 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> were labelled in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .
Samples from individual mice were hybridised onto individual arrays .
Hybridisation and washing of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> chips were done as previously described [ 16 ] .
Fluorescent signals were collected by laser scan ( Hewlett-Packard <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> Scanner ) .
Normalisation of the expression level was done using Affymetrix software MAS 5 , which is based on global scaling of total <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression level per microarray .
The normalised expression values were imported to and analysed by dCHIP [ 24 ] .
Differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified by defining the appropriate filtering criteria in the dCHIP software as : lower 90 % confidence boundary of fold change between the group means exceeded twofold ; the absolute difference between the two groups exceeded 100 ; the P value threshold of the unpaired t-test was 0.05 .
The false discovery rate was established with a permutation test for each pairwise comparison to estimate the proportion of false-positive <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Hierarchical <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> clustering was performed with dCHIP to characterise the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression patterns during CIA .
The default clustering algorithm of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> was as follows : the distance between two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> is defined as 1 -- r , where r is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the standardised expression values of the two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> across the samples used .
To characterise the functional relationship between differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> Ontology ( GO ) term classification incorporated in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - Chip Analyzer was performed .
The significant level for a function cluster was set at P < 0.005 , and the minimum size of a cluster was three <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> of CIA in ( DBA/1  FVB/N ) F2 progeny .
In a previous study , we carried out a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> screen to identify <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> controlling CIA susceptibility in ( DBA/1  FVB/N ) F2 progeny .
For the phenotype of arthritis severity , only one <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , Cia2 , was identified , with a highly significant logarithm of the odds ( LOD ) score of 12 [ 10 ] .
However , Cia2 contributed to only 16 % of the phenotype variations , indicating that there should be some small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> whose contributions to CIA were not big enough to reach the significant threshold value of linkage .
To identify these potential small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , we reanalyzed the data using a lower threshold value of linkage ( P = 0.05 ) .
We reasoned that since the main candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of Cia2 , complement component C5 ( Hc ) , was proven to be essential for CIA development and because the FVB/N strain is C5 deficient [ 10,25 ] , some small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> might be masked by Cia2 .
To exclude the masking effect of C5 , we performed linkage analysis with 3 datasets , the first containing all 290 F2 progeny , the second 77 C5 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> F2 progeny and the third 133 C5 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - F2 progeny .
Eight <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> were linked to the phenotype of CIA severity ( loci 1 to 8 , Table 2 ) , with P values varying between 0.043 and 0.003 .
These eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> were located on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 16 , and 17 .
Five <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> were identified in at least two datasets .
Of the eight <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> , five had DBA/1 as the susceptibility <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , and three had FVB/N as the susceptibility <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Lander and Botstein [ 26 ] suggested a LOD score of between 2 and 3 to ensure an overall false positive rate of 5 % , which means that using a lower threshold value will prevent false negative <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> at the expense of increasing false positive <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
Being aware of this , we examined these <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> to search whether they , or their <termsem="SO:0000860"> syntenic </term> <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> on the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , have been previously linked to arthritis .
Four small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> overlapped with arthritis <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> identified previously .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Locus </term> 1 and 2 overlap with Cia13 and Cia14 , which control severity of CIA in ( DBA/1  BALB/C ) F2 progeny [ 27 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Locus </term> 5 located on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 10 overlaps with Cia8 , which was identified in ( DBA/1  B10.Q ) F2 progeny [ 28 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Locus </term> 6 overlaps with Pgia7 , which controls susceptibility to proteoglycan-induced arthritis ( PGIA ) and was identified in ( BALB/C  DBA/2 ) F2 progeny [ 29 ] .
The <termsem="SO:0000860"> syntenic </term> <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> of five small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> have been reported to be linked to RA .
These are <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> 22q11 and 12p13-q24 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 22 and 12 ( the counterparts of <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 2 ) , 12p13-pter on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 12 ( the counterpart of <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 3 ) , 21q22-qter and 10q22-23 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 21 and 10 ( the counterparts of <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 5 ) , 17q21-25 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 17 ( the counterpart of <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 6 ) and 3q29-qter on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 3 ( the counterpart of <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 7 ) [ 2,4 ] .
Strain-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
We detected the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression profiles using three mice per group , which is a small number .
Being aware of the importance of data reproducibility , we determined the coefficient of variation ( CV ) to measure data variability .
The CV for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> on the chip and the mean CV for the entire <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> set were calculated .
The mean CV ranged between 18.4 % and 25.8 % for all experimental groups , and this relatively low CV indicated that these data could be used for further analysis ( Table 1 ) .
To search for strain-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , we performed comparisons of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression between the DBA/1 and FVB/N strains at all four phases of CIA , including NC , PI , OA and CA .
For the naive mice without immunisation , 361 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially expressed between the two strains .
On day 10 after immunisation , when both strains did not show any sign of the disease , 141 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially expressed .
After DBA/1 mice developed CIA , 184 and 85 differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified between these two strains at the onset and chronic phases , respectively .
When the lists of the differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> at the four phases were merged and <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were excluded , 509 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified ( Additional file 1 ) .
Twenty-one <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> consistently showed differential expression between the two strains at all phases .
Besides these 21 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , only 3 additional <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were strain-specific differentially expressed during the 3 phases after CIA induction ( PI , OA and CA ; Figure 1 ) .
Disease-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
To identify the disease-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in CIA , we detected the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were differentially expressed in LNs during CIA in the susceptible strain .
Three experimental conditions , PI , OA and CA , were compared with the NC group .
On day 10 after immunisation , 102 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially expressed -- most of them were upregulated ( 78 out of 102 ) -- while at the onset phase of the disease , only 26 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially expressed .
At the chronic phase of the disease , 184 differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified , with 156 downregulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Only one <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was differentially expressed at all three phases of CIA .
Besides this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , five , one and six differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were shared by PI with OA , PI with CA and OA with CA , respectively ( Figure 2a ) .
Taken together , 310 disease-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially regulated during CIA in DBA/1 mice ( Additional file 2 ) .
To further characterise the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression pattern during CIA , we performed hierarchical cluster analysis for these 310 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Six <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> clusters were identified ( clusters I to VI , Figure 2b ) , each with a distinct <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression pattern during CIA .
Cluster I contains 16 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , representing <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were upregulated after induction of CIA .
The expression of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> reached a peak at the onset phase of the disease and functional clustering results revealed that they are related to the immune response .
Cluster II contains 12 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> whose expression was gradually upregulated and reached a peak at the chronic phase of CIA .
These <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are mainly related to the immune response , organelle membrane and extracellular region and space .
Cluster III contains 78 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were only upregulated at the PI phase .
These <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are related to the intercellular junction .
More than half of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( 156 of 310 ) belong to cluster IV and represent <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> specifically downregultaed at the chronic phase .
These <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are functionally related to lymphocyte proliferation , T cell activation , protein binding as well as the notch signal pathway .
Cluster V contains eight <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> downregulated at the PI phase .
Cluster VI contains 18 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> downregulated at the OA phase .
The GO term classification showed no functional cluster that was significantly enriched in these two <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> clusters .
Candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for the small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> of CIA .
To identify candidate susceptibility genes for the CIA small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , we compared the list of strain-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with the list of disease-specific differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ; 117 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were shared by both lists ( Additional file 3 ) .
Figure 3 visualises <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> of the 117 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> retrieved from Ensembl [ 30 ] in relation to the 8 small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
The eight <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> were located on 7 <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 16 and 17 .
Since the confidence intervals of <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> in F2 progeny are around 20 cM [ 26 ] , we used 40 Mb as the confidence intervals for all <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> .
Twenty-one <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were located in the confidence intervals of six of the eight <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
We located 5 , 4 , 2 , 1 , 3 and 6 potential candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> within the confidence intervals of <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 and 8 , respectively , while no candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was identified for <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> 4 and 7 .
Table 3 summarises the 21 candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> identified in this study .
Two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , hspa1a and Oas1a , were upregulated at the OA phase of CIA and Oas1a was also upregulated at the PI phase .
Except for these two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , all other 19 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were downregulated at the chronic phase of CIA .
All <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , except hspa1a , showed expression differences between the two strains at the NC phase .
Five <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially expressed at all phases of CIA , including H2-Q10 , Mapk14 , Pscd1 , Kpnb1 and Wdr1 .
Among these five <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , H2-Q10 had a consistently higher expression in the DBA/1 than the FVB/N strain in all CIA phases , while the other four <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> had a higher expression in the DBA/1 strain at the early stages , including NC , PI and OA , but a lower expression at the chronic phase .
GO term classification analysis revealed that the functional cluster of protein kinase cascade was significantly enriched in the 21 candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
This functional cluster contained four <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , including Mapk14 , Mapk8ip3 , Stat5a and Gna12 .
In this study , we attempted for the first time to identify small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> in an F2 progeny .
Small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> are defined as those reaching the threshold value of P = 0.05 but that did not reach the significant threshold value suggested by Lander and Botstein [ 26 ] .
Although not significant , there is evidence that most of the eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> likely contain susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for CIA .
First , we performed the linkage analysis in three datasets , including all 290 F progeny , 76 C5 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> F2 progeny and 133 C5 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - F2 progeny .
Five of the eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> were identified in at least two datasets , suggesting that these <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> are reproducible .
Second , many <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> identified in the present study overlap with arthritis <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> previously identified , including <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 .
In addition , <termsem="SO:0000860"> syntenic </term> analysis revealed that the counterpart <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> on the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> of many of these eight <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> are linked to RA .
For five of the eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> the DBA/1 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are the arthritis-enhancing <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , while the FVBN <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are the arthritis-enhancing <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> in the other three <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , indicating that some susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> could come from the resistant strain .
Interestingly , <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> 2 and 7 partially overlap with two arthritis-related <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> identified by us in the same F2 progeny [ 10 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Locus </term> 2 was located at the same <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> as Cia27 , a <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> controlling IgG2a antibody levels to collagen II .
Recently , we have refined this <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> into a 4.1 Mb <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> and showed that a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> within this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> regulates CIA severity by controlling the IgG2a antibody levels to collagen II [ 31 ] .
Locus 7 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 16 overlaps with Lp1 , which controls lymphocyte proliferation .
Furthermore , according to our unpublished data , loci 8 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 17 controls lymphocyte adherence during development of CIA .
Therefore , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> within the small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> could affect CIA severity through controlling arthritis-related phenotypes .
Several studies have been carried out to detect <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression during CIA , all of which used joints as the target tissue [ 15,16,21,22 ] .
This study , for the first time , detected <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression in LNs during CIA .
We present an extensive study of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression patterns in LNs of both <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> susceptible and resistant strains at four different phases of CIA .
In both strains , differentially regulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were highly concentrated at the PI and CA phases , and only a small number of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were differentially expressed in two or three phases .
This indicates that biological responses in LNs were stronger in the PI and CA phases than in the OA phase , and the responses at different phases were different .
When comparing the susceptible to the resistant strain , the biggest difference was found in one cluster of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( cluster IV , Figure 2 ) .
These <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> had a higher expression in DBA/1 than in FVB/N at the early phases of CIA ( NC , PI and OA ) and the opposite expression pattern in the CA phase .
GO term classification revealed that these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were related to lymphocyte proliferation and activation , suggesting that lymphocytes in the DBA/1 strain are more activated than those in the FVB/N strain .
However , this difference is not CIA specific because the expression difference between the two strains existed in mice without immunisation .
Additionally , some <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> related to the immune response were upregulated in the DBA/1 strain but not in the FVB/N strain during CIA .
These differences could explain why a higher antibody response to collagen II occurred in the DBA/1 strain compared to the FVB/N strain , and might partially explain the difference of the susceptibility to CIA between both strains .
Twenty-one <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified as potential candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for six of the eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> according to their <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression patterns during CIA and their <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> locations </term> .
No candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were located in <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> 4 and 7 , suggesting that QTG <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> of the susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> inside these two <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> might not affect the phenotype by regulating <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression .
Two of the 21 candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were reported to be involved in arthritis .
Mapk14 , a candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> for <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 8 and also called p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) alpha , regulates the production of arthritis-essential cytokines , such as tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-1 [ 32 ] .
Moreover , inhibitors of p38 MAPK could attenuate CIA in rats [ 33 ] , and p38 MAPK is becoming a potential therapeutic target in RA [ 32 ] .
Stat5a , a candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> for <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> 6 , is an essential molecule for lymphoid development and differentiation [ 34 ] .
Stat5a-deficient mice were reported to lose tolerance , resulting in the development of autoimmune diseases .
Stat5a is suggested to contribute to tolerance through maintenance of the CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cell population [ 35 ] .
Therefore , we have presented a strategy to identify small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> and search for potential candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> within them .
However , it is noteworthy that the low statistical threshold and small number of animals per group could lead to some false positive results .
On the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> level , some of the eight small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> identified using a very low threshold value ( P < 0.05 ) could be false positives .
For example , <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> 4 was identified with a low P value and does not overlap with any previously identified arthritis <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
On the transcriptome level , the small number of animals per group and the low threshold used to detect <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression could also result in false positives in the differentially expressed <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Furthermore , the differential expression of a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> could result not only from <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> difference between two strains , but also from other factors .
Therefore , our findings should be confirmed in future studies .
We present a strategy to search candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
With this strategy , we identified 21 candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for 8 small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> regulating CIA susceptibility .
Our future studies will be carried out using two approaches .
The first is generating congenic animals for promising small-effect <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> that have relatively high P values and overlap with previously-identified arthritis <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
The second approach is investigating candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> using both mouse and human studies .
Candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> will be selected according to their function and <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> between the two strains .
Thereafter , we will generate knock-out mice to investigate the role of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in CIA .
For the <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> whose counterparts on the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> are linked to RA , we will investigate the candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> using case-control association studies in RA cohorts .
