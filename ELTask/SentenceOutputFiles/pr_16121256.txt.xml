<termsem="PR:000003601"> Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase </term> Deficiency in Gene-Targeted Mice .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase </term> ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> ) deficiency is the most common inherited disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid -oxidation in humans .
To better understand the pathogenesis of this disease , we developed a mouse model for <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  ) by gene targeting in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice developed an organic aciduria and fatty liver , and showed profound cold intolerance at 4 C with prior fasting .
The sporadic cardiac lesions seen in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice have not been reported in human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> patients .
There was significant neonatal mortality of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  pups demonstrating similarities to patterns of clinical episodes and mortality in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient mouse reproduced important aspects of human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency and is a valuable model for further analysis of the roles of fatty acid oxidation and pathogenesis of human diseases involving fatty acid oxidation .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase </term> ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> ) deficiency is one of the most common inherited disorders of metabolism .
This defect in fatty acid oxidation can lead to severe and sometimes fatal disease , especially in young children because they are unable to tolerate a fasting episode .
Metabolic complications include very low blood glucose concentrations and generation of toxic by-products .
This disorder can result in sudden infant death .
Using a process known as gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells , the authors have developed a mouse model with the same enzyme deficiency .
This mouse model of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency develops many of the same disease characteristics found in affected children .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient mouse model shows a high rate of newborn loss , intolerance to cold , and the characteristic biochemical changes in the blood , tissues , and urine that are very similar to those found in the human disease counterpart .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient mouse model will allow researchers to better understand disease mechanisms so that new preventive measures or therapies can be developed .
Mitochondrial -oxidation of fatty acids provides energy , especially during fasting conditions .
Fatty acid oxidation occurs in mitochondria and consists of a repeating circuit of four sequential steps .
There are four straight-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases involved in the initial step .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase </term> ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> ) ( the mouse gene is <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> , whereas the protein is <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> ) , specifically , is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of medium-chain length ( C6 -- C12 ) fatty acid thioesters [ 1 ] .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> is transcribed in the nucleus , translated in the cytosol , and translocated into the mitochondrial matrix [ 2 -- 4 ] .
Once inside the mitochondrial matrix , the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> monomers are assembled into homotetramers to gain enzymatic activity [ 4 ] .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> activity is essential for complete fatty acid oxidation .
Inherited <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency exists in humans as an autosomal recessive disorder .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency was first described in 1982 -- 1983 [ 5 -- 7 ] and has been described in numerous patients [ 1,8 -- 11 ] .
The carrier frequency in the Caucasian population has been estimated to be between 1 in 50 to 80 with an incidence of clinical disease expected at around 1 in 15,000 [ 1,9,12 ] .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients exhibit clinical episodes often associated with fasting .
Patients manifest disease usually during the first two years of life .
Symptoms include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and Reye-like episodes [ 1 ] .
It is estimated that approximately 59 % of patients presenting clinically between 15 to 26 mo of age die during their first clinical episode [ 1 ] .
The pathogenesis of the wide range of metabolic disturbances in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency is poorly understood and certain aspects of patient management are controversial .
An animal model for <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency is essential to better understand the pathogenesis of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency and to develop better management regimens for human patients .
To gain further insight into the mechanisms of this disease , we developed a mouse model of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency by gene targeting in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells ( for reviews [ 13,14 ] ) .
The mutant mice had many relevant features characteristic of the disease found in human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients , along with some unexpected findings .
Gene Targeting and Generation of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - Deficient Mice .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> insertion vector ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> IV2 ) was designed to undergo gap repair of the 1.3-kb deleted region upon homologous recombination in 129P2 ( 129P2/OlaHsd ) ES cells E14 -- 1 .
Correct targeting of the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> locus resulted in a duplication of exons 8 , 9 , and 10 and integration of flanking plasmid and Neo sequences ( Figure 1A ) .
The insertion vector was designed to duplicate exon 8 , 9 , and 10 at the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> locus .
Translation of the duplicated exon 8 region results in the formation of premature stop codons resulting in truncation of the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> monomer .
Specifically , the first premature stop codon arises after translation of only seven amino acids from the duplicated exon 8 .
The resulting <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> monomer is missing the C-terminal domain -helixes that are responsible for making intersubunit contacts to generate the functional <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> homotetramer .
Strategy for Disruption of the Mouse <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> Gene .
( A ) The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> IV2 insertion targeting vector with a deleted 1.3-kb region encompassing exon 10 and flanking sequences .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> IV2 undergoes gap repair upon homologous recombination at the endogenous <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> locus resulting in a duplication of exons 8 , 9 , and 10 at the disrupted allele .
( B ) Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from ES cells screened by PCR .
Probe A , a DNA fragment consisting of a portion of exon 10 that is not present in the targeting vector , hybridizes to an endogenous 3.1-kb fragment and , upon homologous recombination , to a 13.2-kb fragment .
Lane 1 represents a wild-type ES cell line , and Lane 2 and 3 represent targeted ES cell lines .
ES cell clones were screened by PCR ( data not shown ) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis .
Southern blot analysis used an exon 10 probe ( probe A ) , not present in the targeting vector , hybridized to a 13.2-kb band in addition to the 3.1-kb endogenous band indicating targeted insertion of the vector at the <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> locus ( Figure 1B ) .
Correctly targeted ES cell clones were microinjected into B6 ( C57BL/6NTac ) blastocysts to generate chimeric mice .
Chimeric mice were backcrossed to both 129P2 and B6 inbred mice to produce <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + /  and eventually <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice on a B6/129 mixed background .
The studies described here were conducted exclusively on the B6/129 mixed background compared with littermate controls or B6/129 control groups maintained by intercrosses as were the mutants .
Perpetuating this mutation as a congenic mutant line on the 129P2 background proved impractical .
The 129P2 mice were poor breeders as wild-types , and when introduced , the <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> mutation was nearly lost on this background because of the high rate of neonatal death .
Because of the molecular structure of the targeted allele , it proved virtually impossible to distinguish all three potential genotypes .
We could clearly detect the presence or absence of the targeted allele , however , whether a particular mouse was <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  or <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + /  could not be determined by Southern blot or PCR of genomic DNA .
Ultimately <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice were ascertained by immunoblot analysis of offspring with subsequent perpetuation of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice as separate groups .
RT-PCR amplification from exon 7 to 11 from total heart RNA amplified the expected 600-base pair ( bp ) fragment in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + /  mice , and a 1.5-kb fragment in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice ( data not shown ) .
Sequence analysis of the 1.5-kb fragment revealed that the amplified fragment consisted of exon 7 to exon 10 with 280 bp of pGEM plasmid sequence followed by exons 8 -- 11 .
Some of the plasmid sequences , along with the pPGKNEOpA sequence , were deleted from this spliced mRNA .
Northern blot analysis revealed <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> was normally expressed in all tissues analyzed from <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice with the most robust expression occurring in brown fat , kidney , heart , skeletal muscle , and liver with minimal expression in the brain , white fat , and testes ( Figure 2 ) .
Interestingly , although RT-PCR amplified an incorrectly spliced <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> transcript , no <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> transcripts were detected by northern blot analysis from <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
These results strongly suggest that the mutant RNA is unstable and degraded rapidly or , alternatively , undergoes nonsense mediated RNA decay .
Northern Blot Analysis from <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  ( n = 2 ) and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + ( n = 2 ) Mice .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> message was detected from the heart , liver , brown fat , brain , kidney , and muscle ( and white fat and testes , data not shown ) of only <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice .
Most robust expression occurred in brown fat , kidney , heart , and skeletal muscle .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice had no detectable message in all tissues examined .
Immunoblot analyses of liver homogenates with anti- <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> antisera demonstrated that the 42 kDa <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> monomer was present in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice , but not in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice ( Figure 3 ) .
As a control analysis , anti -- <termsem="PR:000003602"> short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase </term> ( <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term> ) antisera revealed no differences in levels of expression of <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term> protein between <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice ( Figure 3 ) .
Immunoblots of Liver Homogenates from <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  Mice .
These were probed with anti- <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> antibody or anti- <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term> antibody .
Homozygous <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice had no detectable <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> protein .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> protein is only detectable under the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> protein -- spiked ( positive control ) lane .
As a control analysis , liver homogenates probed with anti- <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term> antibody revealed that <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term> protein was present in both <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
No <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> positive-control protein is detected by anti- <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term> antibodies ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> lane ) .
mw , molecular weight standards .
Enzyme activity was analyzed in mouse liver homogenates using the electron transport flavoprotein ( ETF ) reduction assay with octanoyl-CoA ( C8 : 0 ) and palmitoyl-CoA ( C16 : 0 ) as substrates .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice had a significant reduction in ability to dehydrogenate octanoyl-CoA and a modest reduction in activity toward palmitoyl-CoA compared to <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice ( Table 1 ) .
Specifically , the dehydrogenation of octanoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA substrates were reduced by 75 % and by 30 % , respectively , in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice as compared to <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + controls .
Characteristics of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - Deficient Mice .

eExpressed as a ratio relative to the internal standard .
Significant neonatal mortality was noted in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  pups .
Although equal numbers of pups were born from <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice , only 41 % of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice survived to weaning as compared to 98 % of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice ( Table 1 ) .
The mechanism of neonatal loss remains undetermined .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  pups are abandoned more frequently than <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + pups for unknown reasons .
They are likely more prone to hypothermia than <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + .
Because of the difficulty of distinguishing the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mutants from the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + /  heterozygous pups by molecular analysis due to the insertion mutation , we could only compare <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / +  <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + matings with <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /   <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  matings .
Thus , we were unable to evaluate the pedigrees from heterozygous matings .
Fasting and Cold Intolerance .
In order to examine the stress effects of fasting on <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient mice , they were fasted for 24 h prior to analysis .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice displayed lower serum glucose and elevated serum free fatty acid levels although neither result was significant , as compared to <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice ( Table 1 ) .
To determine the effects of cold stress , mice were fasted for 18 h and placed in 4 C environment for a 3-h period .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice were significantly compromised within this short period of cold stress , some severe enough to result in fatalities .
After 1 h of the cold challenge , the average rectal temperature of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice ( n = 5 ) was 23.4 C as compared with 35 C for <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice ( n = 4 ) .
Rectal temperatures declined to unrecoverable temperatures of 16.7 -- 19.2 C in three of the five <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
By the end of the 1.5-h mark , the two surviving <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice averaged 22.7 C .
In contrast , all four <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice survived the 3-h cold stress , ending with an average rectal temperature of 33.6 C .
Organic Acid and Acylcarnitine Analysis .
Urine organic acid analysis revealed that <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice developed an organic acid profile similar to <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient human patients .
Specifically , when fasted for 18 h , <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice developed significantly elevated concentrations of adipic , suberic , and sebacic acids and hexanoylglycine as compared to <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + controls , which showed trace to no detectable amounts of the same organic acids ( Table 1 ) .
Adipic acid is not specific to <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency .
We also evaluated -hydroxybutyric and acetoacetic concentrations and found no significant differences between <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> genotypes ( data not shown ) .
Comparison of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice revealed no significant differences in total serum carnitine concentrations between <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice , but <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice had a 5 - to 6-fold elevation of serum decenoylcarnitine evident in the acylcarnitine profile ( Figure 4A ) .
Bile acylcarnitine analysis revealed a similar acylcarnitine pattern as in serum ( Figure 4B ) .
However , the acylcarnitine profiles of the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice are different from those of human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients ( Figure 4C ) .
Human patients present with elevated levels of C6 , C8 , and C10 : 1 acylcarnitines , as did the mutant mice ; however , the predominant peak was C8 acylcarnitine in humans , whereas in the mouse it was C10 : 1 acylcarnitine .
( A ) Serum acylcarnitine analysis of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + ( n = 4 ) and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice ( n = 4 ) .
There are significant elevations in acylcarnitine species as indicated in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .

Internal standards are indicated by an asterisk .
Complete histopathologic examination of one group of mutant and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + control mice after a 24-h fast demonstrated diffuse microvesicular and macrovesicular hepatic steatosis in 6 -- 8-wk-old <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice whereas <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice had no histologic changes ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
In another group of 4-wk-old <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice fasted for 24-h , there were minimal to no abnormalities in all organs evaluated .
Only the older <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice , therefore , demonstrated hepatic steatosis .
In addition , we found sporadic cardiac lesions in multiple <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
Histopathology of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  Mice .
( A ) <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice had no evidence of hepatic steatosis following a 24-h fast .
Liver section with Oil-Red O stain .
( B ) Hepatosteatosis in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mouse following a 24-h fast .
Oil-Red O stained liver sections revealed severe and diffuse microvesicular and macrovesicular hepatic steatosis in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
( C and D ) Diffuse cardiomyopathy with chronic active multifocal myocyte degeneration and necrosis in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
In one example , an <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mouse had diffuse cardiomyopathy with chronic active multifocal myocyte degeneration and necrosis ( Figure 5C and 5D ) .
Changes in degenerating myocytes included swelling , pale staining , and , in portions of the sarcoplasm , replacement of myofibrils with finely granular eosinophilic material .
Nuclei of affected myocytes were large , pale , and vesicular and had prominent nucleoli .
In the most severely affected areas , there was loss of myocytes accompanied by fibrosis .
In the wall of the aorta at the base of the heart there was multifocal degeneration of the elastic tissue , accompanied by multifocal collections of globular translucent yellow-brown pigment interpreted to be ceroid/lipofuscin .
Similar deposits were scattered within adjacent adipose tissue .
Successfully targeting <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> produced a mouse model for <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency with features that mimic the clinical , biochemical , and pathologic phenotype found in human patients .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients have abnormal plasma and urine metabolites associated with the medium chain -- length enzyme specificity .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients [ 15 ] often display a characteristic urinary hexanoylglycine peak , as was seen in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice .
Acylcarnitine analysis indicated , however , mouse <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> is more active toward longer chain substrates than the human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD enzyme </term> .
This finding is similar to that seen with <termsem="PR:000003604"> very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase </term> ( <termsem="PR:000003604"> VLCAD </term> ) where mouse <termsem="PR:000003604"> VLCAD </term> is most active toward C16 acyl-substrates as compared to human <termsem="PR:000003604"> VLCAD </term> with the most enzymatic activity toward C14 acyl-substrates [ 16 ] .
ETF reduction assays of liver homogenates were performed to characterize the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice at the enzymatic level .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice had a significantly reduced ability to dehydrogenate C8-CoA , as is the case in human patients where <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> activity is reduced to near zero with C8-CoA .
This was less so with palmitoyl-CoA ( C16 : 0 ) .
Because there was clearly no <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> antigen detected in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice , the residual dehydrogenase activity measured with these two substrates must represent the activity of other chain length -- specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenases .
A high degree of neonatal mortality in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice was a striking observation and appears to be analogous to the patterns of clinical episodes and mortality in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients .
<termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice exhibited significant neonatal mortality with approximately 60 % of the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  pups dying prior to weaning at 3 wk of age .
Human patients present with hypoglycemia , hypoketonemia , and nonketotic organic aciduria precipitated by fasting , most frequently during the first 24 mo in life [ 1 ] .
It is likely that neonatal <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  pups are manifesting sensitivity to fasting with decompensation in a short period of time if maternal milk is not ingested .
In contrast , no mortality was noted in adult <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice unless challenged with cold stress and fasting .
Under cold challenge conditions , however , <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice were unable to maintain body temperature .
Brown fat is predominantly responsible for thermogenesis and normally expresses high levels of <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> mRNA .
The microvesicular and macrovesicular hepatic steatosis seen in fasted <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice is consistent with the primary pathological finding seen in human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> patients with fasting stress .
Sporadic cardiac lesions in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice , however , were an interesting and unexpected finding .
The diffuse cardiomyopathy with multifocal myocyte degeneration and necrosis observed in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice has not been reported in human <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> patients , however , cardiac arrhythmias and dysfunction have been reported in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient patients [ 17 , 18 ] .
Interestingly , cardiomyopathy has been observed in <termsem="PR:000003604"> VLCAD </term> deficiency [ 19 ] and other disorders of long chain fat metabolism such as severe <termsem="PR:000005835"> CPT-1 </term> and -2 deficiencies [ 1 ] .
Thus it is tempting to relate the cardiac problems in the mouse to the apparent broader range of substrate utilization of mouse <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> .
The inconsistent liver and cardiac lesions in these mice is analogous with the significant inter - and intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity seen in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> deficiency in humans [ 1,20 ] .
In comparisons with our experiences with the other mouse models for acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies , the overall phenotype of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice is less severe than that found in <termsem="PR:000003600"> LCAD </term>  /  mice , yet more pronounced than the <termsem="PR:000003604"> VLCAD </term>  /  or <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term>  /  mouse models [ 16,21,22 ] .
All of these mutants are cold intolerant and display varying degrees of fatty changes in liver , heart , and kidney .
<termsem="PR:000003600"> LCAD </term>  /  mice show more spontaneous deaths and gestational losses than the other deficiencies [ 21 ] .
The significant neonatal mortality in <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice is distinctive from these other mouse models suggesting a greater degree of sensitivity to fasting intolerance .
The phenotypes of both the <termsem="PR:000003604"> VLCAD </term>  /  and <termsem="PR:000003602"> SCAD </term>  /  mice are relatively mild if the animals are not cold stressed [ 16,22 ] .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient mouse offers new insights into the pathogenesis of mitochondrial -oxidation deficiencies and will provide a robust tool to better understand the role of fatty acids in other relevant diseases .
Construction of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> targeting vector .
A neomycin resistance gene cassette [ 23 ] was subcloned into the SalI site of pGEM11Zf ( + ) .
The plasmid was digested with EcoRI and the overhangs were filled with Klenow enzyme .
Subsequent ligation of the blunt ends recircularized the vector and destroyed the EcoRI site within the polylinker of the pGEMl1Zf ( + ) plasmid .
Next , an 8-kb <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> genomic fragment spanning exons 8 , 9 , and 10 and flanking intron sequences , originally obtained from a Lambda FIXII 129Sv mouse genomic library [ 24,25 ] , was directionally cloned into the NotI and XhoI sites of pGEM11Zf ( + ) .
The vector was digested with BamHI and EcoRI to remove a 1.3-kb BamHI/EcoRI genomic fragment containing exon 10 and flanking intron sequences .
The digested vector , without the 1.3-kb BamHI/EcoRI genomic fragment , was purified by gel purification and recircularized by ligation using three oligonucleotides : 5  - AATTGTCGACA-3  ; 5  GATCGTCGACA-3  ; and 5  - TCGATGTCGAC-3  .
The recircularized vector , resulting from the ligation of the long arm to the short arm of homology , contained a unique SalI site where the 1.3-kb exon 10 region was deleted .
Generation of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> - deficient mice .
The <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> insertion vector was linearized by SalI digestion , the site of the 1.3-kb genomic fragment deletion , and electroporated into E14 -- 1 ES cells ( a kind gift from R. Kuhn ) , derived from 129P2 mice .
Correctly targeted <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> insertion vector was designed to undergo gap repair of the 1.3-kb deletion upon double stranded -- break repair [ 26 ] during homologous recombination .
Southern blot analysis was conducted to confirm homologous recombination .
Genomic DNA from G418 resistant ES colonies was digested with EcoRI , electrophoresed , blotted , and probed with an 850-bp probe ( probe A ) generated by PCR from <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> exon 10 to intron 10 .
This DNA fragment is not present within <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> insertion vector and was expected to hybridize to a 13.2-kb genomic DNA fragment upon homologous recombination .
Correctly targeted ES cell clones were microinjected into B6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice .
Chimeric mice were subsequently backcrossed to B6 and 129P2 mice to produce gene-targeted mice AcadmtmUab1 / + ( <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + /  ) and eventually AcadmtmUab1/tm1Uab <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  ( B6 ; 129 ) mice .
Mice were negative for mouse pathogens based on serological assays for ten different viruses , aerobic bacterial cultures of nasopharynx and cecum , examinations for endo - and ectoparasites , and histopathology of all major organs .
RNA analysis .
Total RNA was isolated from the heart of 30 day old <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + , <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + /  , and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice by standard techniques using guanidinium thiocyanate method [ 27 ] .
Reverse transcription was performed using random oligonucleotides as recommended by the manufacturer ( Clontech , Mountain View , California , United States ) .
PCR was subsequently performed using oligonucleotides specific to exon 7 and exon 11 of <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> .
PCR amplifications were performed as described above .
PCR fragments were subsequently sequenced after subcloning into pGEM-T Easy vector ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin , United States ) .
In order to determine the extent of <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> mRNA expressed from the <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice , northern blot analysis was performed .
Total RNA was isolated from heart , liver , brown fat , brain , kidney , skeletal muscle , white fat , and testes of 3-mo-old <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice using the Ultraspec RNA Isolation Kit ( BIOTEX Laboratories , Inc. , Houston , Texas , United States ) as per manufacturer 's protocol .
Ten g of total RNA from each sample was loaded onto a 0.8 % agarose-formaldehyde gel , transferred to nitrocellulose filter ( Hybond N ; GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences Corp. , Piscataway , New Jersey , United States ) , and hybridized with 32P-radiolabeled full-length mouse <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> cDNA probe using standard procedures [ 28 ] .
Hybridizations were performed under highly stringent conditions ( 42 C in 2  SSC , 50 % formamide , 10 % dextran sulfate , 5  Denhardt 's reagent , 1 % SDS , and salmon sperm DNA ) for 18 h .
The hybridized filter was washed two times in 4  SSC , 0.1 % SDS and two times in 2  SSC ; 0.1 % SDS at 55 C for 1 h .
The filter was exposed to autoradiographic film ( Hyperfilm MP ; GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , New Jersey , United States ) .
Replicate agarose-formaldehyde gels were stained by ethidium bromide to verify equal RNA loading .
Immunoblot analysis of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> protein .
To evaluate the quantity of <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> protein in mouse tissue , liver samples from 6 -- 8-wk-old <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + ( n = 1 ) and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  ( n = 3 ) mice were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at  80 C .
For analysis , tissue was homogenized and lysed in RIPA buffer ( 1  PBS , 1 % Nonidet P-40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , and 1 % SDS ) with 10 % glycerol and Complete Protease Inhibitor , ( Roche Diagnostics Corporation , Indianapolis , Indiana , United States ) , 1 mM of phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride , and 1 mM of sodium orthovanadate .
Lysates were quantified by Bradford BCA protein assay ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , California , United States ) .
Protein lysates were denatured , separated in 8 % SDS-PAGE , and transferred overnight onto a 0.45 m nitrocellulose membrane ( Schleicher and Schuell , Keene , New Hampshire , United States ) .
After blocking with 5 % nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 % Tween-20 , the membrane was immunoblotted overnight at 4 C with 1:500 dilution of an anti- <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> antibody .
Blots were incubated in anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 -- 4 h at room temperature using standard procedures and developed by chemiluminiscence ( Renaissance , NEN Lifesciences Products , Boston , Massachusetts , United States ) .
Liver enzyme activity .
In order to evaluate <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> activity in mice , liver homogenates were prepared from <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + ( n = 5 ) and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice ( n = 5 ) .
The sensitive and highly specific anaerobic ETF reduction assay was used on tissue extracts with octanoyl-CoA ( C8 ) and palmitoyl-CoA ( C16 ) as substrate as previously described [ 29 ] .
Fasting and cold challenge .
Eight-wk-old <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice were fasted for 18 h ( cold tolerance experiments ) or 24 h ( serum glucose , free fatty acid , organic acid , and carnitine experiments ) prior to analysis .
Glucose concentration was measured in 10 l sera using an Ektachem DT II system ( Johnson and Johnson Clinical Diagnostics , Rochester , New York , United States ) .
Total non-esterified fatty acids ( NEFA ) were measured by an enzymatic , colorimetric method ( `` NEFA-C '' reagents , Wako Diagnostics , Richmond , Virginia , United States ) .
The assay was modified to accommodate a reduced sample size ( 10 l ) and use of a microplate reader for measurement of optical density at 550 nm .
Urine organic acid analyses were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy as previously described [ 22,30 ] , except tetracosane ( C24 ; Sigma , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) was used as the internal standard , and quantitative determinations were made based on comparison with synthetic calibration standards .
Acylcarnitine analyses in serum and bile were conducted using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry [ 31,32 ] .
Histopathology .
Twelve mice were examined for gross and histologic abnormalities , including one male and one female <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mouse 18-mo-old , one male and one female <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mouse 6-mo-old , two male and two female <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term>  /  mice 4-wk-old , and two male and two female <termsem="PR:000003601"> MCAD </term> + / + mice 4-wk-old .
Kidney , spleen , pancreas , liver , brain , heart , testicles , ovaries , and skeletal muscle were fixed by immersion in buffered 10 % formalin , processed routinely for paraffin sectioning , sectioned at 5 m , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
Frozen liver sections were prepared using standard methods and sections were stained with Oil-red-O .
Slides were examined without knowledge of genotype or age .
Other mice were examined because of sporadic clinical disease .
Those with visible cardiac enlargement were evaluated for cardiac lesions .
Statistical analyses .
Results between groups were tested for statistical significance using Student 's t-test .
A p < 0.05 was set as significant .
The GenBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank ) accession number for the mouse gene <termsem="PR:000003601"> Acadm </term> is U07159 .
