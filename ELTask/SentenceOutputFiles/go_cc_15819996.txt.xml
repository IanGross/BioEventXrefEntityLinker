<termsem="GO:0005634"> Nuclear </term> localization of Annexin A7 during murine brain development .
Annexin A7 is a member of the annexin protein family , which is characterized by its ability to interact with phospholipids in the presence of Ca2 + - ions and which is thought to function in Ca2 + - homeostasis .
Results from mutant mice showed altered Ca2 + - wave propagation in astrocytes .
As the appearance and distribution of Annexin A7 during brain development has not been investigated so far , we focused on the distribution of Annexin A7 protein during mouse embryogenesis in the developing central nervous system and in the adult mouse brain .
Annexin A7 is expressed in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the developing brain where a change in its subcellular localization from <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> to <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> was observed .
In the adult CNS , the subcellular distribution of Annexin A7 depends on the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> type .
By immunohistochemistry analysis Annexin A7 was detected in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> of undifferentiated <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> at embryonic days E5 -- E8 .
At E11 -- E15 the protein is still present in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> predominantly located in the ventricular germinative zone surrounding the lateral ventricle .
Later on , at embryonic day E16 , Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium translocates to the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> .
Neuronal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of all areas in the adult brain present Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> , whereas glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) - positive astrocytes exhibit both , a <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasmic </term> and <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining .
The presence of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> Annexin A7 was confirmed by extraction of the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> from isolated <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> obtained from neuronal and astroglial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines .
We have demonstrated a translocation of Annexin A7 to <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> in early murine brain development and the presence of Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neuronal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> in the adult animal .
The role of Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of differentiating and mature neuronal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> remains elusive .
Annexins form a family of structurally related proteins , which bind to negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca2 + - dependent manner [ 1 ] .
They are characterized by a bipartite structure with a conserved C-terminal core domain and a unique N-terminal domain that varies in length and amino acid composition .
The C-terminal domain is formed by either a four - or eightfold repeat of approximately 70 amino acids , each repeat carrying a Ca2 + - binding site , and is responsible for phospholipid binding .
The N-terminal regions are thought to confer functional diversity to the annexin proteins [ 2 ] .
The biochemical features in vitro were analyzed extensively , but the in vivo functions of annexins remain unclear .
Annexin A7 , the first annexin to be described , was isolated as the agent that mediated aggregation of <termsem="GO:0042583"> chromaffin granules </term> and fusion of <termsem="GO:0016020"> membranes </term> and phospholipids in the presence of Ca2 + - ions [ 3 ] .
Expression studies demonstrated the distribution of Annexin A7 in a wide variety of tissues and <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> mainly enriched in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> in close association with <termsem="GO:0016020"> membranous </term> structures , but it was also described in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> of adrenal chromaffin <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 4 ] .
The presence of an alternatively spliced cassette exon gives rise to two Annexin A7 isoforms corresponding in molecular mass to 47 kDa and 51 kDa .
The isoforms differ in their N-terminal domain and exhibit a tissue-specific expression pattern .
The 47 kDa isoform is present in all tissues except for skeletal muscle , where the 51 kDa isoform is exclusively present .
Heart muscle , brain tissue and red blood <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> contain both isoforms [ 5-8 ] .
Previous studies indicated that the subcellular localization of Annexin A7 changes during myoblast differentiation .
In undifferentiated <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> the protein is equally distributed between <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> and <termsem="GO:0005624"> <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> fractions </term> while in differentiated <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> it is exclusively present in the <termsem="GO:0005624"> <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> fraction </term> [ 7 ] .
Reports by Clemen et al. [ 9 ] and Herr et al. [ 8,10 ] demonstrated roles for Annexin A7 in shape and osmotic resistance of red blood <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , platelet aggregation velocity , and in the velocity of spreading astrocytic Ca2 + - waves .
Annexin A7 is also involved in the maintenance of regular cardiac electrophysiology and Ca2 + - homeostasis [ Schrickel et al. , submitted ] .
Detailed reports on appearance and distribution of Annexin A7 during brain development are not available .
In the present study we focus on the distribution of Annexin A7 in the developing brain of mice embryos between E5 and E16 , and in the adult mouse brain .
Annexin A7 is expressed in the early mouse embryo .
First we examined the expression of Annexin A7 in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Bruce4 , established from C57BL/6J mice ) and the early stages of mouse embryonic development at the mRNA level by northern blot analysis and at the protein level by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry , respectively .
Northern blot analysis shows in ES - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and at embryonic days E7 , E11 , E15 , and E17 two mRNA species of 1.8 kb and 2.4 kb , which result from alternative splicing in the untranslated 3 ` end ( Fig. 1A ) [ 11 ] .
We found similar Annexin A7 mRNA levels in the four embryonic stages .
Reprobing with a -actin probe verified equal loading ; the appearance of a faster migrating mRNA species in addition to the 2.0 kb species is characteristic for -actin [ 12 ] .
On the protein level , ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> express only the smaller Annexin A7 isoform of 47 kDa ( Fig. 1B , neuro-2a <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and heart tissue are included for control ) .
Expression of Annexin A7 .
( A ) Northern blot analysis of RNA from ES - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and embryos E7 , E11 , E15 , E17 probed with a full length annexin A7 cDNA .
Transcripts of 1.8 and 2.4 kb are detected in all stages examined ( upper panel ) .
Reprobing with a -actin probe verified equal loading ( lower panel , 2.0 kb band ) .
( B ) Murine ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( ES ) express only the small Annexin A7 isoform .
Both isoforms are expressed in neuroblastoma neuro-2a <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( N2A ) , heart ( HRT ) and brain tissue ( CNS ) from adult mice .
Proteins from neuro-2a and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , heart and brain were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( 12 % acrylamide ) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes .
The Western blot was probed with mAb 203 -- 217 followed by incubation with a peroxidase coupled secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> .
Detection was with enhanced chemiluminescence .
Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of the protein during early development .
Annexin A7 immunoreactivity using mAb 203 -- 217 , which specifically recognizes both isoforms of Annexin A7 , can be observed in the two <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> types of the cylinder stage at E5 with a weaker Annexin A7 expression in the ectoderm ( Fig. 2A -- C ) .
At E8 Annexin A7 can be detected in almost all tissues of the embryo ( data not shown ) .
A correlation between the presence of Annexin A7 and the origin of a <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> type from one of the three germ layers is not apparent .
We specifically noted the localization of the protein in the neuroepithelium of the neural fold and tube ( Fig. 2D -- F , proximal , E8 ; Fig. 2G -- I , distal , E13 ) .
At the subcellular level , Annexin A7 was present in punctate structures mainly in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> of all examined <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Fig. 2E , F ) .
This distribution was also observed during subsequent development .
Annexin A7 immunoreactivity in early mouse embryos .
( A ) Phase contrast , embryo E5 : The egg cylinder consists of an inner <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> mass ( a ) representing the ectoderm and an outer layer of endoderm <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( b ) .
( B ) Immunostaining of the paraffin section was performed using purified mAb 203 -- 217 and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG .
Annexin A7 is expressed in both <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> types of the egg cylinder with a strong staining of the endoderm and a weaker staining of the ectoderm .
The <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> are devoid of immune reactions .
( C ) Negative control using the secondary Cy3 - <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> only .

( D ) An intense Annexin A7 immunostaining is detectable in the neuroepithelium of the neural tube ( a , lumen of neural tube ) .
( E , F ) Higher magnifications of the neuroepithelium show that Annexin A7 is expressed in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> .

Annexin A7 changes its subcellular localization in the embryonic brain at E16 .
Next we analysed the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cellular </term> and subcellular distribution of Annexin A7 in the developing mouse brain ( Fig. 3 ) .
At E13 -- E16 in transverse sections of the embryonic brain , most of the immunoreactive <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> are present in the ventricular germinative zone surrounding the lateral ventricle ( Fig. 3A , overview E16 ; Fig. 3H , overview E13 ) .
A closer inspection revealed that Annexin A7 is mainly localized in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> at E13 ( Fig. 3B , E ) .
During further development the immature <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> have rounded up two days later , but they retain Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> at E15 ( Fig. 3C , F ) .
At E16 we observed the first prominent <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining of Annexin A7 ( Fig. 3D , G ) in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the intermediate zone ( Fig. 3I , oval ) , which contains neurons radially migrating towards the growing neopallium cortex [ 13,14 ] and also glial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> forming the white matter of the adult cortex .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cells </term> located marginally in the neopallial cortex also exhibit a <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> stain .
Labelling in the ventricular germinative zone is less prominent and the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> is no longer more strongly stained than the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> .
Subcellular localization of Annexin A7 in embryos E13 , E15 and E16 .
Paraffin sections of embryonic brain were stained with purified mAb 203 -- 217 .
Annexin A7 was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> .
( A ) Overview , at E16 the immature GFAP-negative <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the forming cerebral neocortex ( b ) surrounding the lateral ventricle ( a ) are strongly stained ; square , a higher magnification of this area is given in ( I ) .
( B ) Higher magnification of the earlier stage E13 ( H ) shows , that the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> are stained in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> ( arrowhead ) .
( C ) Two days later at E15 the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> have rounded up , and Annexin A7 stays in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> .
( D ) At E16 the first <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining becomes apparent ( arrowhead ) in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the intermediate zone located between ventricular germinative zone and marginal neopallial cortex as seen in ( I ) , oval .
( E-G ) Confocal microscopy confirms the results in B-D .
( H ) Overview , at E13 the immature GFAP-negative <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> are strongly stained ; a , lateral ventricle .
( I ) Higher magnification of a cortical section of ( A , square ) demonstrating ventricular , intermediate , and marginal zones ; oval , a higher magnification of this area is given in ( D , G ) .
Mature neurons in adult mouse brain show an intense <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining of Annexin A7 .
Both Annexin A7 isoforms are found in adult brain tissue ( Fig. 1B ) .
In general , we observed two characteristic staining patterns for Annexin A7 , a prominent <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> stain in neurons ( determined by lack of GFAP-immunoreactivity , localization , morphology ) and a <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasmic </term> and <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> stain in astrocytes ( GFAP-positive ) in all areas of the mature murine brain .
In the neocortex ( isocortex ) Annexin A7 was strongly enriched in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neurons of all six cortical laminae ( Fig. 4A , section derived from cortex temporalis ) .
For control , in the adult brain type-1 astrocytes can be characterized by a positive GFAP-stain ( Fig. 4B ) .
Fig. 4F demonstrates the presence of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> Annexin A7 in a neocortical neuron of the external granular layer ( layer II ) and in an astrocytic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> of the neocortical molecular layer ( layer I ) which additionally exhibits an intense signal in the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> and in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cellular </term> branches .
A further <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> type of the isocortex showed a strong immunoreactivity in both , <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> and <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> , and was identified as pyramidal neuron based on morphology and absence of GFAP immunoreactivity .
However , Annexin A7 apparently is more enriched in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> ( Fig. 4E ) .
Annexin A7 is present in neurons and astrocytes of the cortex temporalis and hippocampal formation of 10-weeks-old mice .
( A ) Low magnification of the cortex temporalis presents an Annexin A7 expression in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the pial border , in neurons of all six isocortical laminae , and a weak signal in the adjacent white matter .
( B ) Corresponding section stained with GFAP .
( C ) Staining in the Stratum pyramidalis ( a ) and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus ; square , a higher magnification of acorresponding area is given in ( G , H ) .
An intense Annexin A7 immunostaining is detectable .
( D ) Corresponding section stained with secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> only .
( E ) Presence of Annexin A7 in pyramidal neurons ( lamina pyramidalis externa ) of the isocortex temporalis .
These neurons were identified based on their morphology , distribution and lack of GFAP staining .
AnnexinA7 exhibits a punctate staining , which is pronounced in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> ( arrowhead ) .
( F ) Higher magnification of image ( A ) also shows Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neurons ( lamina granularis externa ( corpuscularis ) , arrowhead ) and in the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> and <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of astrocytes ( lamina molecularis , arrow ; GFAP-confirmed ) .
( G ) Higher magnification of the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus confirms the presence of the Annexin A7 protein in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> ( arrowhead ) of mature neurons .
( H ) To further confirm this , a similar section derived from an AnxA7 - / - mouse was stained with the annexin specific <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> and lacked the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> signal .
The residual stain of the tissue is unspecific , as it is also observed in controls of the AnxA7 - / - brain omitting the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> ( data not shown ) .
All paraffin sections were stained with mAb 203 -- 217 ( A , C , E , F , G ) or anti-GFAP - <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> ( B ) .
The hippocampal control section ( D ) lacks the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> .
In the hippocampal formation we detected prominent Annexin A7 immunostaining in the stratum pyramidalis and in the dentate gyrus and also a weak astrocytic staining ( Fig. 4C ) .
The astrocytes are mainly localized in the area between <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> exhibiting <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> Annexin A7 staining and show the protein also in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> and the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> ( data not shown ) .
When we analyzed the pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus at a higher magnification we found that Annexin A7 again mainly localized to the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> ( Fig. 4G ) .
Polyclonal <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> gave a similar staining pattern ( data not shown ) .
The intense <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining was absent in controls either stained only with the secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> ( Fig. 4D ) or in brain sections derived from AnxA7 - / - mice stained for Annexin A7 ( Fig. 4H ) .
The residual staining seen in the AnxA7 - / - brain is unspecific as it is also present in corresponding negative controls lacking the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> .
The absence of Annexin A7 protein in brain and other tissues of the AnxA7 - / - mouse has been verified in [ 10 ] .
In another actual study of the knock out mouse we detected a thickened <termsem="GO:0005604"> <termsem="GO:0005605"> <termsem="GO:0045178"> basal </term> membrane </term> </term> and a widened <termsem="GO:0005576"> intercellular space </term> .
This may cause unspecific binding of the secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> .
An equal staining of Annexin A7 was also found in the cerebellum ( Fig. 5A ) .
<termsem="GO:0005634"> Nuclei </term> of neurons in the stratum granulosum show the most prominent staining ( Fig. 5C , D ) .
In the stratum moleculare , which is poor in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> bodies of neurons , only a few dots appear which also correspond to <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neurons .
Astrocytes are also positive for Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> and <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> ( data not shown ) .
The signal of the pial border and the prominent stain of the white matter tracts ( laminae medullares ) are due to Annexin A7 positive astrocytes ( Fig. 5 A -- C ) .
Higher magnification of the boundary layer between stratum moleculare and granulosum ( Fig. 5D ) revealed an Annexin A7 signal in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> , but also in the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> and at the <termsem="GO:0005886"> plasma membrane </term> of Purkinje <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Fig. 5E ) .
The typical pair of <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> points to the margin of the cerebellar cortex .
The specificity of the Annexin A7 signal was further confirmed in similar brain sections of the AnxA7 - / - mouse ( Fig. 5F ) .
Fig. 5G shows Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0030424"> neurites </term> ( <termsem="GO:0030424"> axons </term> ) connecting the laminae medullares with the Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> layer .
Most likely these are the <termsem="GO:0030424"> axons </term> of the Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Apart from these efferent <termsem="GO:0030424"> neurites </term> the laminae medullares ( lamina alba , white matter ) contain afferent mossy and climbing fibers .
Thus , the intense stain of the cerebellar white matter arises from Annexin A7 located in astrocytes and <termsem="GO:0030424"> neurites </term> .
Annexin A7 immunostaining in the cerebellum of adult mice .
( A ) Low magnification of the cerebellum presents an Annexin A7 expression mainly in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the stratum granulosum and laminae medullares .
( B ) Corresponding section stained for GFAP .
( C ) Higher magnification of folia of the cerebellum , where a polyclonal anti-AnnexinA7 <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> was used ; square , a higher magnification of acorresponding area stained with mAb 203 -- 217 is given in ( D ) .
Between stratum granulosum and stratum moleculare the layer of Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( stratum neuronorum piriformium ( ganglionare ) ) can be observed .
( D ) Staining of the band of Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( arrows ) .
The positive Annexin A7-stain in the stratum granulosum is due to staining of the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neurons .
( E ) In addition to an intense staining of the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> , the <termsem="GO:0043025"> <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> body </term> is AnnexinA7-positive including both <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> of the Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> shown .
( F ) Corresponding section from an AnxA7 - / - mouse .
( G ) AnnexinA7 staining of <termsem="GO:0030424"> axons </term> ( arrowheads ) running from the laminae medullares to the Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> layer located in the round end of a convolution .
Sections A , D , E , F , G were stained with mAb 203 -- 217 .
Expression of Annexin A7 in the adult human isocortex .
In the human parietal neocortex of aged individuals without any neuropathological alterations , subpial astrocytes exhibited a staining of Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> .
A <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> presence of Annexin A7 was limited to single astrocytes ( Fig. 6B ) .
Pyramidal neurons , predominantly those of layer V exhibited Annexin A7 at the <termsem="GO:0005886"> plasma membrane </term> of their <termsem="GO:0043204"> perikaryon </term> as well as of the <termsem="GO:0045177"> apical </term> <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrite </term> ( Fig. 6A , C ) .
The neurons lacked a signal for Annexin A7 in their <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> .
<termsem="GO:0045177"> Apical </term> <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> within the molecular layer also indicated a positive staining for Annexin A7 ( Fig. 6B ) .
The staining pattern of Annexin A7 in the human autopsy brain did not change after pre-treatment with trypsin .
Annexin A7 immunostaining in human isocortex .
( A ) Pyramidal neurons ( bold arrow ) and <termsem="GO:0045177"> apical </term> <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> ( small arrows ) were clearly labeled with the <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> against Annexin A7 in the human parietal cortex .
( B ) A <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendritic </term> staining was also seen in the molecular layer ( small arrows ) .
In addition the subpial astrocytes were weakly labeled ( double headed arrows ) .
The staining was <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasmic </term> , only few astrocytes showed a <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining as well ( inset ) .
( C ) Enlargement of ( A ) : Annexin A7 was seen at the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> of the <termsem="GO:0043204"> perikaryon </term> ( bold arrow ) and the <termsem="GO:0045177"> apical </term> <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrite </term> ( small arrows ) .
( D ) A blank control lacking the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> did not show a specific labeling , but autofluorescent lipofuscin was detectable in the neurons ( arrowheads ) .

Presence of Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> from neuronal and astroglial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
The <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localisation of Annexin A7 in mice observed in immature <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> at E16 and differentiated adult neurons could be only detected as a strong signal when the brain sections were pre-treated with trypsin before <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> staining .
This procedure is thought to allow the <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> to access epitopes masked by the formaldehyde fixation .
Methanol fixation of cultured <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> led to inconsistent results .
Antigen retrieval in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue sections employs various heating or proteolytic pre-treatment methods [ [ 15-17 ] ; Ein Handbuch fr die Histologie , dianova GmbH , Hamburg , Germany ] .
These methods can result in moderate or strong specific <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> staining , but the detectability of other antigens might be decreased .
Moreover , the optimal pre-treatment has to be individualised for each antigen .
To verify the presence of endogenous Annexin A7 in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> , we used a biochemical approach and purified <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> from neuro-2a , PC-12 , and C6 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and treated them with a hypotonic extraction buffer to obtain the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> ( Fig. 7A ) .
The <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> and the remaining <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> , from which the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> has been extracted partially , were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting .
Western blots probed with mAb 203 -- 217 showed Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> of neuronal ( neuro-2a , PC-12 ) and astroglial ( C6 ) <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines ( Fig. 7A ) , however , the large isoform could only be clearly extracted with <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> from C6 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
For control , <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> against LAP2 , Emerin and <termsem="GO:0045298"> tubulin </term> were used to verify that the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> ( marker : LAP2 , which is anon - <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> - bound isoform of LAP2 ) was successfully extracted and also not contaminated by <termsem="GO:0031965"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> membranes </term> ( marker : Emerin ) or by <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> ( marker : <termsem="GO:0045298"> tubulin </term> ) .
Likewise , in these neuronal and astroglial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines Annexin A7 had been observed in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> by immunofluorescence ( Fig. 7B and data not shown ) .
We noticed no difference between PC-12 and neuro-2a <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , however , as for the brain sections , we found an increase of the Annexin A7 staining after pre-treatment with trypsin .
<termsem="GO:0005634"> Nuclear </term> localization of Annexin A7 .
( A ) Extraction of Annexin A7 from <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neuronal ( PC-12 , N2A ) and an astroglial ( C6 ) <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> line using a hypotonic buffer .
Samples of total <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( c ) , and corresponding amounts of <termsem="GO:0031965"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> membranes </term> ( <termsem="GO:0031965"> m </term> ) and <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> ( <termsem="GO:0005654"> p </term> ) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting .
Annexin A7 ( AnxA7 ) isoforms are extractable from the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> of the indicated <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( 47 kDa and 51 kDa isoform , arrowhead ) .
For control , immunoblotting of LAP2 ( 75 kDa ; non - <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> - bound isoform ) , Emerin ( EM , 34 kDa ) , and <termsem="GO:0045298"> tubulin </term> ( <termsem="GO:0045298"> TB </term> , 55 kDa ) which are specific for <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> ( LAP2 ) , <termsem="GO:0031965"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> membranes </term> ( Emerin ) , and the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> ( <termsem="GO:0045298"> tubulin </term> ) are shown .
Note that the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> is only partially extractable .
( B ) Immunofluorescence images of the PC-12 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> used .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cells </term> were fixed with paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with Triton X-100 , pretreated with trypsin as indicated , and stained with Annexin A7 specific mAb 203 -- 217 , DAPI in blue , bar 10 m .
In the present study we explored the appearance of Annexin A7 during mouse development at the mRNA and protein level and focused on the central nervous system during embryogenesis .
Northern blot and immunohistochemistry analysis show the expression of Annexin A7 in all embryonic tissues from day E5 on , the earliest day studied .
Differentiating <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , like the neural ectoderm , which is the origin of the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> belonging to the nervous system , show Annexin A7 immunoreactivity mainly in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> .
Endodermal as well as mesodermal <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> exhibit a similar subcellular localization of the protein .
In the developing brain we noted a striking change in the subcellular distribution of Annexin A7 .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cells </term> in the stratum germinativum of the neopallial cortex , which surrounds the lateral ventricle , show at E13 and E15 a staining for Annexin A7 mainly in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> .
But this staining largely disappears and at the following day E16 we detect Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> in the intermediate and marginal zone of the neopallium .
The different expression patterns of Annexin A7-positive <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> from the ventricular germinative zone to the marginal zone of the later neocortex observed in this study are similar to the developmental patterns of Tenascin-C-positive astroglial precursors following the guidance of the radial glial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 18 ] .
Moreover , the patterns resemble that of migrating and differentiated neurons described by Berry et al. [ 13 ] .
Neurons that are generated prenatally in the proliferative ventricular layer of the neopallial cortex subsequently migrate through the intermediate zone to form the different cortical <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> layers in a declining inside-out gradient of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> maturation .
These observations suggested that the subcellular localization of Annexin A7 depends on developmental stage and <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> type .
In the adult brain we generally observed a <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization for Annexin A7 in neurons whereas astrocytes exhibited both a <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosolic </term> as well as a <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining .
However , pyramidal neurons of the isocortex and Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the cerebellum exhibited a <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosolic </term> stain of intermediate intensity including their <termsem="GO:0030424"> neurites </term> and <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> .
We have previously reported the expression of Annexin A7 in human temporal neocortex and hippocampus obtained from neurosurgery for therapy-refractory epilepsy and found the two Annexin A7 isoforms restricted to the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> and <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of astrocytes , whereas neurons lacked any signal [ 19 ] .
The hippocampal area showed typical signs of Ammon 's horn sclerosis , but the adjacent temporal neocortex tissue did not show any histopathological alterations .
This data is in discrepancy with our actual observation in the murine brain .
To determine if this is due to different methods in immunofluorescence staining or indeed different expression patterns in mouse and human , we repeated the immunofluorescence of human brain .
This time we investigated sections from human parietal cortex of autopsy brain .
The astroglial expression of Annexin A7 could be confirmed , although not all astrocytes exhibited the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> staining .
Pyramidal neurons however indicated a distinct staining of Annexin A7 most prominent along their <termsem="GO:0030425"> dendrites </term> .
The different results obtained for the neurons may be explained by the fact that we previously used frozen tissue sections or that they were derived from patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsia .
On the other hand the actual human brain tissue used was from aged patients and did not correspond to the age of the mice included in this study .
In cultured <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> after <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> damage or apoptosis ( unpublished observations ) or in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> treated with a Ca2 + - ionophore Annexin A7 translocated from the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> to <termsem="GO:0005623"> cellular </term> <termsem="GO:0016020"> membranes </term> [ 19 ] .
We therefore favor the hypothesis that Annexin A7 in the sensitive neurons of the human autopsy brain may have similarly translocated to the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cellular </term> <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> .
This property of translocation and <termsem="GO:0016020"> membrane </term> binding is common to all annexins and commercially available kits for apoptosis detection employ recombinant AnnexinA5 .
The presence of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> Annexin A7 in murine brain was confirmed by controls using sections from the AnxA7 - / - mouse and by a biochemical extraction of the protein from the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> .
Both Annexin A7 isoforms described in brain tissue seemingly are expressed by neurons and astrocytes , which was shown using total <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> extracts of cultured neuo-2a , PC-12 , and C6 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
In addition to their expression in brain , both Annexin A7 isoforms have only been described in heart muscle and red blood <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 5-8 ] .
Although the inactivation of the annexin A7 gene did not interfere with the viability and development of knock out mice [ 10 ] , their generation allowed us to address the role of Annexin A7 in specific <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> types [ 8,9 ] .
Indeed , when we analyzed primary astrocytes from an AnxA7 - / - mouse for Ca2 + - dependent signaling processes , we found that they exhibited a significantly increased velocity of mechanically induced astrocytic Ca2 + - waves as compared to wild type [ 9 ] .
This led us to propose , that Annexin A7 can act as a Ca2 + - buffer and is involved in Ca2 + - homeostasis .
In neurons Ca2 + ions play major roles in various physiological and pathophysiological processes [ 20-25 ] .
One can speculate about an involvement of Annexin A7 in the regulation of these Ca2 + - dependent processes , propositions that need further investigation .
However , such roles are confirmed for heart function by studies of Schrickel et al. [ submitted ] , who described an involvement of Annexin A7 in the maintenance of a regular cardiac electrophysiology and Ca2 + - homeostasis .
An altered subcellular location during embryogenesis was also reported for Annexin A11 .
The developing gray matter of the rat embryonic spinal cord exhibited primarily <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization of Annexin A11 , while immunoreactivity was lost from the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> in the adult spinal cord [ 26 ] .
In contrast , our studies show a relocation of Annexin A7 from the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> to the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> in <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of the embryonic neuronal tissue .
The Annexin A7 distribution is determined by a variety of factors .
An important one appears to be Ca2 + , which promotes binding of Annexin A7 to <termsem="GO:0016020"> membranes </term> and also allows aggregation of annexins [ 27 ] .
Binding partners of Annexin A7 such as sorcin might represent additional factors [ 28 ] .
Although the members of the annexin family are generally found at the <termsem="GO:0005886"> plasma membrane </term> , in the <termsem="GO:0005737"> cytoplasm </term> or in association with the <termsem="GO:0005856"> cytoskeleton </term> , Annexins A1 , A2 , A4 , A5 and A11 have been described to be localized at least partially in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> [ 26,29,30 ] .
Studies with human foreskin fibroblasts demonstrated that Annexin A1 , A4 and A5 are all present in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> at higher concentration than in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> [ 31 ] .
Raising <termsem="GO:0005622"> intracellular </term> Ca2 + led to relocation of these annexins to the <termsem="GO:0031965"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> membrane </term> .
An important role for annexins in mediating the Ca2 + - signal within the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of the fibroblasts was proposed .
These results mirror studies with stably transfected C6 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , in which high <termsem="GO:0005622"> intracellular </term> Ca2 + - concentrations induced a marked redistribution of Annexin A7 from its localization in the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> to the <termsem="GO:0031965"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> membrane </term> [ 19 ] .
None of the annexins contains a typical <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization signal and their mechanism of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> import remains to be elucidated .
For Annexin A11 it was shown that <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization is mediated by its N-terminal region , which also contains a binding side for the S100 protein calcyclin [ 29 ] .
More recently Tomas and Moss [ 32 ] showed , that Annexin A11 and S100A6 assemble at the <termsem="GO:0005635"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> envelope </term> during <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> breakdown .
Their role in this process is not known .
In general it seems that the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization of the annexins is actively regulated .
For example the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of Annexin A2 is controlled by sequestration of the AnxA2/p11 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> modulated by phosphorylation and by a <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> export signal found in the AnxA2 3 -- 12 region [ 33 ] .
One function of Annexin A2 in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> , that appears not to involve binding of p11 , has been suggested by its purification as part of a primer recognition <termsem="GO:0043234"> protein complex </term> that enhances DNA polymerase-activity in vitro [ 34 ] .
The annexins may participate in a <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> response to initial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stimulation or to a Ca2 + - transient , presumably by regulating DNA replication .
For Annexin A7 such a pathway is very speculative at the moment .
Future studies are however directed by these findings and will concentrate on the identification of the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization signal of Annexin A7 as well as on the role of Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear compartment </term> .
In this article we report the translocation of Annexin A7 to <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of differentiating <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> in the developing murine brain .
In the adult brain Annexin A7 generally was detected in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neurons .
Astrocytes , cerebellar Purkinje - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and neocortical pyramidal neurons exhibited both , Annexin A7 in the <termsem="GO:0005829"> cytosol </term> and in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> .
Thus , the subcellular localisation of Annexin A7 depends on the developmental stage and the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> type .
A role of Annexin A7 as well as of other annexins in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> remains speculative .
The results obtained by immunofluorescence were confirmed by extraction of Annexin A7 from <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of neuronal and glial <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines .

<termsem="GO:0019814"> Antibodies </term> used in this study were mAb 203 -- 217 directed against the core domain of mouse Annexin A7 [ 6 ] ( purified IgG , 1:50 ) specifically recognizing both Annexin A7 isoforms [ [ 6,10 ] , and data not shown ] , a polyclonal <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> against mouse Annexin A7 [ 10 ] ( 1:200 ) , a polyclonal antiserum raised against the astrocyte-specific <termsem="GO:0005882"> intermediate filament </term> glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ; DAKO , 1:400 ) , anti- - <termsem="GO:0045298"> tubulin </term> ( Sigma , 1:1000 ) , anti-Emerin ( novocastra , 1:2000 ) , and polyclonal anti-LAP2 ( kindly provided by Ronald Foisner , 1:5000 ) .
Immunohistochemical staining using mAb 203 -- 217 as the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> was with AlexaFluor488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes , Leiden , The Nether-lands ) or Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> .
Polyclonal anti-Annexin A7 <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> and anti-GFAP - <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> were combined with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes ) .
The specific labelling of Annexin A7 detected with the anti-mouse-IgG secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> in mouse tissue sections was confirmed using primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> , which were directly coupled to Alexa Fluor488 .
The paraffin-embedded sections were first treated three times for 2 min in xylene to remove paraffin and then rehydrated step by step with descending concentrations of ethanol for <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> staining [ 35 ] .
After three washings in PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2.7 mM KCl , 8.1 mM Na2HPO4 , 1.5 mM KH2PO4 , pH 7.4 ) , the tissue sections were incubated in PBS containing 0.1 % trypsin for 10 min at room temperature to free formaldehyde-crosslinked epitopes [ 15-17 ] .
After additional three washes with PBS , non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating the slides with PBG ( 0.5 % BSA , 0.045 % fish gelatine in PBS ) in 10 % normal goat serum ( NGS ) for 2 h. Incubation with the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> was performed at 4 C overnight diluted in PBG supplemented with 1 % NGS .
After five washes in PBG for 5 min each , the slides were incubated for 1 h with the secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> at room temperature , washed three times in PBG and three times in PBS , 5 min each , rinsed in water and embedded in gelvatol [ 36 ] .
For control , sections were incubated only with the secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> or sections obtained from an annexin A7 knockout mouse were used [ 10 ] .
Samples were examined with a confocal laser scan microscope ( Leica TCS SP ; Leica , Bensheim , FRG ) .

Microwave pre-treatment was used for all sections [ 15 ] .
Trypsin pre-treatment was used as indicated .
Carbocyanine 2 and 3 labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> ( Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) were used to detect the primary <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> and showed similar staining patterns .
Blank controls were performed , too .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cell </term> culture and growth conditions .
The <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines used were cultured according to the instructions provided by ATCC : murine neuroblastoma neuro-2a ( ATCC CCL-131 ) , rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 ( ATCC CRL-1721 ) , and rat glioblastoma C6 ( ATCC CCL-107 ) .
One day before fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.5 % Triton X-100 , <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> were seeded on coverslips .
Immunostaining was performed as described for the tissue sections with or without the trypsin treatment .
Extraction of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> Annexin A7 .
Cultured <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> were trypsinized , counted and washed once in PBS .
They were resuspended in buffer1 ( 0.32 M sucrose , 10 mM Tris , pH8 .0 , 3 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM Mg-acetate , 0.1 mM EDTA , 0.5 % NP40 , 1 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ; 1  107cells/400l buffer ) and sonified on ice ( sonifier UP200S , dr.hielscher , 40 s , amplitude 50 % , cycle 0.5 ) .

The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes , washed twice in 1 ml buffer 1 without NP40 and centrifuged again .
The resulting pellet contains purified <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> .
For partial extraction of the <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> according to [ 37 ] , <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> were resuspended in buffer 2 ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM KCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 25 % v/v glycerine , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ; <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of 107cells/30 l buffer ) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes .
An equal volume of buffer 3 was added in aliquots ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7.9 , 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 800 mM KCl , 0.2 mM EDTA , 25 % v/v glycerine , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF , 1 % NP40 , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) ) and the solution was incubated while shaking for further 30 minutes on ice .
Then the solution was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 14.000 g , the resulting supernatant was used as <termsem="GO:0005654"> nucleoplasm </term> , and the pellet was washed once and adjusted to an equal volume with PBS .
<termsem="GO:0005654"> Nucleoplasm </term> and <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> pellet were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting .
