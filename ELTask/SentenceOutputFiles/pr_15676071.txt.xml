Synaptogenesis and outer segment formation are perturbed in the neural retina of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutant mice .
In Leber 's congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) , affected individuals are blind , or nearly so , from birth .
This early onset suggests abnormal development of the neural retina .
Mutations in genes that affect the development and/or function of photoreceptor cells have been found to be responsible in some families .
These examples include mutations in the photoreceptor transcription factor , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> .
A <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutant strain of mice was created to serve as a model for LCA and to provide more insight into <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> 's function .
In this study , an ultrastructural analysis of the developing retina in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutant mice was performed .
Outer segment morphogenesis was found to be blocked at the elongation stage , leading to a failure in production of the phototransduction apparatus .
Further , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors demonstrated severely abnormal synaptic endings in the outer plexiform layer .
This is the first report of a synaptogenesis defect in an animal model for LCA .
These data confirm the essential role this gene plays in multiple aspects of photoreceptor development and extend our understanding of the basic pathology of LCA .
Photoreceptor cells play a primary role in vision by capturing light energy and converting it into neural stimuli .
These sensory neurons are a shared element in all organisms capable of sensing light .
In humans , genetic diseases of the eye are common and the primary site of disease is most frequently photoreceptors ( for review see [ 1-3 ] ) .
Photoreceptors have been well studied , particularly with respect to the biochemistry and physiology of phototransduction .
Insight into the development of vertebrate photoreceptors , however , has lagged behind our understanding of function .
Only recently have the first molecular mechanisms regulating photoreceptor development been identified ( for review see , [ 2,4 ] ) .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> ( <termsem="PR:000005904"> cone-rod homeobox </term> ) is an otx-family homeobox gene expressed predominantly in photoreceptors , from early in their development through to the adult ages [ 5-7 ] .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> gene expression is critically dependent upon <termsem="PR:000012086"> Otx2 </term> , another member of the same homeobox family which is expressed in early photoreceptor cells [ 8 ] .
In rod photoreceptors , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> appears to work in concert with <termsem="PR:000011432"> Nrl </term> , a leucine zipper protein that is also restricted in its expression in the retina to rod photoreceptors [ 9 ] .
Many photoreceptor-specific genes have putative <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - binding elements in their regulatory regions [ 10 ] , including <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> [ 11 ] and arrestin [ 12 ] .
Mutations in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> have been associated with several human diseases that lead to blindness , including cone-rod dystrophy 2 [ 6,13,14 ] , retinitis pigmentosa [ 14 ] , and LCA [ 14-16 ] .
Based on these data , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> was hypothesized to play a critical role in the differentiation and maintainance of photoreceptor cells [ 5,7 ] .
LCA is the most severe genetic disease of photoreceptors ( see [ 17 ] , for recent review ) .
Affected infants exhibit a complete or near complete absence of vision from birth .
Mutations in retinal specific genes , such as <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> , have been associated with LCA [ 14,15 ] , as well as <termsem="PR:000008353"> GUCY2D </term> [ 18 ] , <termsem="PR:000014179"> RPE65 </term> [ 19 ] , <termsem="PR:000003876"> AIPL-1 </term> [ 20 ] , <termsem="PR:000005848"> CRB-1 </term> [ 21 ] , and <termsem="PR:000014182"> RPGRIP-1 </term> [ 22 ] .
There also may be as many as three additional genetically linked loci where genes have not been identified [ 23 ] .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutations in LCA are varied , and include a putative dominant mutation that is proposed to encode a dominant-negative form of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> [ 14,15 ] .
Recessive mutations also have been reported and at least one allele encodes a protein with decreased DNA-binding activity [ 16 ] .
Histopathological and ultrastructural studies of LCA should enable a better understanding of the disease process , and the design of suitable therapies .
Few such studies exist for human LCA ( reviewed in [ 17 ] ) and the majority of such studies examine the globes of adults with LCA , after the tissue has undergone secondary changes .
Only a single study exists where the developing eye of an infant was examined [ 24 ] .
Animal models for LCA have recently been reported and have already served to broaden our understanding of the pathology of this disease [ 25-28 ] .
Since LCA is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder , additional mouse models are in order to allow a full understanding of the many ways in which photoreceptor development can go awry .
In addition to their importance as a locus of disease , photoreceptor cells serve as an excellent model for studies in neuronal differentiation .
Photoreceptor cells are highly polarized .
At their apex , these neurons have a membranous outer segment , which contains proteins involved in the phototransduction cascade .
Loss of function mutations in <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> [ 29 ] , or the structural protein , <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> [ 30 ] , result in an inability to form outer segments .
At the other extremity , photoreceptors terminate with synaptic endings that make contact with the processes of horizontal and bipolar cells [ 31,32 ] .
Rod spherules establish an invaginating synapse with rod bipolar dendrites and axonal endings of horizontal cells .
This synapse is characterized by the presence of a ribbon in the presynaptic cytoplasm .
Cone pedicles make invaginating synapses with the dendrites of on-cone bipolar cells and horizontal cells and basal junctions with the dendrites of off-cone bipolar cells .
The factors regulating the formation of the photoreceptor synapses are completely unknown .
At least one photoreceptor synaptic protein , <termsem="PR:000017084"> HRG4 </term> , contains a potential <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> target sequence in its transcriptional regulatory sequence [ 33 ] .
Few studies of LCA animal models have extended their examination of retinal pathology to the ultrastructural level .
Certain features of neuronal differentiation , such as synapse formation , can be detected definitively at this level of analysis .
With the hope of understanding the neuropathology of LCA in greater detail , we have analyzed the differentiation of the outer retina in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice at the ultrastructural level .
These retinas exhibit several prominent defects .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors demonstrate a complete block in outer segment formation at the elongation stage .
Further , these cells exhibit abnormal synaptic morphology , thereby broadening the function of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> to photoreceptor synaptogenesis .
This represents the first report strongly implicating the process of synapse formation in LCA .
Multiple pathologies in the outer segment layer in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice .
A standard knock-out protocol was used to generate mice in which the homeodomain of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - was targeted and deleted .
Generation of these <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice has been reported elsewhere [ 34 ] .
In this study , in order to characterize further the role of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> in photoreceptor morphogenesis , the outer retinae from <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice were examined using transmission electron microscopy .
At postnatal day 21 ( P21 ) , when <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + photoreceptors exhibited robust outer segments ( Figure 1A , os ) , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas were without a recognizable outer segment layer ( Figure 1B ) .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors had inner segments , demonstrating at least limited photoreceptor polarization in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutant , but the inner segments were extremely short ( Figure 2 ) .
Furthermore , the majority of inner segments showed some morphological differentiation , having approximately as many mitochondria as the control ( Figure 1 and 2 ) .
Occasionally , an inner segment undergoing lysis was noted , appearing swollen or with vacuoles and swollen mitochondria ( data not shown ) .

Photoreceptor inner segments and outer segments are joined by a non-motile connecting cilium that exhibits a characteristic 9 + 0 arrangement of microtubule doublets when viewed in cross-section .
At P21 , in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas , numerous cross sections of connecting cilia were noted ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
Sporadically , connecting cilia contained other than the typical complement of microtubule doublets .
For example , in Figure 3A , the connecting cilium labelled by arrowhead 1 , shows 7 + 0 doublets .
The majority exhibited the characteristic 9 + 0 doublets ( arrowhead 2 and 3 in Figure 3A and Figure 3B ) .
These observations indicate that in addition to inner segment formation , ciliogenesis is also largely intact in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors .
Further , in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas the retinal pigmented epithelium ( PE ) appeared normal , at least up to P21 ( data not shown ) , the oldest age examined .

Nonmotile connecting cilia were observed in cross section ( arrowheads 1,2 , and 3 , for examples ) .
Connecting cilium 1 ( arrowhead 1 ) demonstrated seven microtuble doublets , while cilium 2 and cilium 3 exhibited nine .
In A , a displaced cell nucleus ( n ) appearing pyknotic and abnormal deposition of matrix ( mx ) material of unknown identity were seen , along with large amounts of membranous vesicles ( arrow ) which filled the photoreceptor space and appeared to be released from inner segments .

Scale bar = 1 m .
In addition to the complete absence of outer segments , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas exhibited three other notable pathologies in the outer segment layer .
First , an abnormal deposition of matrix of unknown identity was noted ( Figure 3A , mx ) .
Second , sporadically displaced nuclei were found residing in the space abutting the PE .
Occasionally , these nuclei appeared pyknotic ( Figure 3A , n ) ; but , more frequently exhibited the heterochromatin pattern typical of photoreceptors ( data not shown ) , strongly suggesting that they belonged to ectopic photoreceptors .
The third pathological entity noted in the outer segment layer were numerous small vesicles ( Figure 3A arrow ) 100 to 200 nm in diameter .
They appeared to be emerging from the inner segments , as scanning electron microscopic images showed spherical structures budding from the inner segments ( Figure 3C , arrow ) .
In order to characterize further the morphogenesis of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors , the developing outer segment layer was viewed by scanning electron microscopy at P7 , P14 and P21 ( Figure 4 ) .
In <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + retinas , photoreceptor inner segments , connecting cilia , and the first rudimentary outer segment structures were noted at P7 .
In the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retina , only an occassional connecting cilium was noted emerging from inner segments at this stage ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
This observation was confirmed by comparison with transmission electron micrographs ( Figure 5 ) .
These differences are the earliest noted differences between <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors .
At P14 , elongating outer segments were noted on <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + photoreceptors , occasionally demonstrating a paddle-like structure at their apex ( Figure 4C , os ) .
In <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinae , the vast majority of photoreceptors at this stage demonstrated connecting cilia without outer segments ( Figure 4D , cc ) .
Sporadically , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors would exhibit an irregular structure extending from a connecting cilium ( Figure 4D , cc * ) perhaps representing a malformed outer segment .
Such structures were also observed at P21 ( Figure 4F , cc * ) .
These putative , abnormal outer segments were only rarely noted in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + at P14 , and never at P21 ( Figure 4C and 4E , cc * ) .
Further , in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors , unusually long connecting cilia were noted ( Figure 4F , cc ) .
Serial examination of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors at P7 , P10 , P14 , and P21 by TEM , demonstrated a distinctive lack of any structure interpretable as orderly stacks of discs or forming discs .
These data demonstrate a complete absence of normal outer segment formation in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutant mouse , and the arrest of development of the photoreceptor appendage at the elongation stage of outer segment formation .

In <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + retina , numerous connecting cilia ( A , cc ) were evident at P7 with rudimentary outer segments .
After P7 , in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + outer segment elongation occurs .
Initially , outer segments have a paddle-like structure ( C , os ) which is later shed ( E , os ) .
In <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors , few connecting cilia were observed at P7 ( B , cc ) .
After P7 , connecting cilia were more numerous and occasionally a malformed outer segment was noted extending from a connecting cilium ( D and F , cc * ) .
These were rarely observed in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + and only at P14 ( C , cc * ) .

Finally , the morphology of the malformed <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors was compared to <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> - / - and <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> - / - photoreceptors .
<termsem="PR:000001245"> Rhodopsin </term> and <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> are two photoreceptor-specific genes whose expression is significantly downregulated in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinae [ 10,34,35 ] .
Loss of function mutations in each of these genes separately have been reported to result in a failure to elaborate outer segments [ 29,30 ] .
Photoreceptors from these two mutant mice examined by SEM from the scleral side appeared highly similar to <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors ( compare Figure 4F to Figure 6A and 6B ) .

<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> is necessary for the formation of photoreceptor terminals .
In a previous study , we demonstrated that forced expression of a dominant-negative allele of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> in developing rods blocked formation of both rod spherules in the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) and outer segments [ 7 ] .
To expand on these studies , the ultrastructure of photoreceptor synapses was examined in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas .
In <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + retinas at P21 , newly mature rod spherules were abundant ( Figure 7A ) .
The sperules were blunt or club-shaped structures with a single ribbon associated with a single invaginating synapse ( Figure 7A , arrow indicates one example ; Figure 8A and 8B ) .
Two processes from horizontal cells were situated on either side of the synaptic ridge ( Figure 8B , labelled H ) and one or more dendrites of rod bipolar cells occupied a central position ( Figure 8B , bipolar labelled B ) .
Cone terminals are large , flat pedicles that exhibit many invaginating synapses containing separate sets of horizontal and bipolar cell processes .
Each pedicle contains numerous ribbons .
These terminals were much less common than spherules in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + retinas at P21 ( Figure 7 , box ) .
In the OPL of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas , photoreceptor terminals were highly disorganized at P21 ( Figure 7B , arrows ) .
Processes containing synaptic vesicles and ribbon-like structures were apparent , suggesting at least limited generation of synapse components .
However , well formed spherules and pedicles were not observed .
In addition , many terminals appeared to contain multiple ribbons ( Figure 8C and 8D , r ) not tethered to the plasma membrane and occasionally in perinuclear positions ( Figure 8D ) .
Transmission electron micrographs of the outer plexiform layer in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas .
( A ) In <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + retina at P21 , newly formed rod spherules were abundant ( arrow demonstrates one example ) .
The spherules were club-shaped and contained a single invaginating synapse with one ribbon complex .
Cone terminals form large , flat pedicles that contain many invaginating synapses with separate ribbon structures .
These terminals were more scarce , but apparent in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + retinas at P21 ( one example in box ) .
( B ) In the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retinas , photoreceptor terminals appeared highly disorganized at P21 ( arrows ) .
Well-formed pedicles and spherules were not evident .
Putative terminals containing ribbon-like structures were apparent , suggesting at least limited generation of synapse components .
Many terminals appeared to contain multiple ribbon-like structures , instead of a singule ribbon .
For example , terminal 1 and 2 contained two ribbons each , whereas terminal 3 appeared to contain only one .

In this study , an ultrastructural analysis of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors was carried out .
As <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutations have been associated with Leber 's congenital amaurosis , the findings in this study broaden our understanding of the pathology of this disease .
Two prominent pathologies were characterized in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retina : ( 1 ) An absolute block in outer segment morphogenesis was noted , with the block occuring at the elongation stage of outer segment formation ; ( 2 ) <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors exhibited a severe perturbation in synapse formation .
This represents the first report of a synaptogenesis defect in an animal model of LCA .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors can not complete outer segment morphogenesis .
Mutations in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> represent one of a collection of gene mutations that lead to an outer segment formation defect .
Homozygous null mutations in the <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> / <termsem="PR:000013290"> RDS </term> gene [ 36 ] or in <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> [ 29 ] lead to a failure of outer segment formation .
The deficits in <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> - / - and <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptor morphogenesis were found to be very similar .
Vesicular structures in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors were observed that were similar to those previously noted in the <termsem="PR:000013290"> rds </term> / <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> - / - mouse .
It was initially proposed that these vesicles were due to the breakdown of outer segment membranes that were not properly recruited to the outer segments in the absence of <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> , or were from the result of the breakdown of the microvilli of Mller cells [ 30 ] .
Strong support in favor of the former explanation was provided by Nir and colleagues who demonstrated the presence of <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> protein in these vesicles using immunoelectron microscopy against a <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> epitope [ 37 ] .
Further , as shown here , the vesicles appear to bud from the inner segments themselves .
In developing photoreceptors , an extraordinary growth process occurs whereby the outer segment is generated from the nascent connecting cilium ( see [ 38 ] and references therein ) .
<termsem="PR:000013290"> Peripherin </term> / <termsem="PR:000013290"> RDS </term> and <termsem="PR:000014157"> ROM-1 </term> proteins ( localized in disc rims ) and the <termsem="PR:000001119"> opsin </term> proteins ( localized throughout the discs ) have important roles in the structural integrity of mature outer segments ( see [ 39,29 ] ) .
<termsem="PR:000014157"> ROM-1 </term> - / - mice produce disorganized outer segments with large disks [ 40 ] .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> , by virtue of being a transcription factor , presumably controls genes that are responsible for the building and perhaps maintenance of the outer segment structure , including <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> and <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> .
Using northern blots [ 34 ] , microarrays [ 10 ] , and serial analysis of gene expression ( SAGE ) [ 35 ] , we have defined a large number of genes that are altered in their expression level in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice .
We found that <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> expression was severely diminished in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - animals , and <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> mRNA was reduced by approximately 30 % .
Transgenic mice with variable levels of expression of wild type <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> exhibit rod degeneration [ 41 ] , indicating the importance of the level of <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> expression .
In addition , the timing of <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> expression may be very important , as indicated by studies in Drosophila .
In Drosophila , <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> ( <termsem="PR:000001245"> ninaE </term> ) is expressed in photoreceptors R1 -- R6 .
In <termsem="PR:000001245"> ninaE </term> null mutants , the rhabdomere , a structure analogous to vertebrate outer segments , fails to develop in R1 -- R6 photoreceptors [ 42 ] , reminiscent of the situation in <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> - / - mice [ 29 ] .
An intriguing experiment by Kumar et al. [ 43 ] demonstrated a temporal requirement for <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> expression during rhabdomere development .
In <termsem="PR:000001245"> ninaE </term> null flies , a <termsem="PR:000001245"> ninaE </term> transgene under the control of a heat shock promoter was subjected to various temperature shifts during development .
Heat shock during the normal time of <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> onset resulted in substantial and long-lasting rescue of photoreceptor structure and transient rescue of photoreceptor physiology .
However , expression shortly before or after this critical period failed to rescue , suggesting that <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> expression during a discrete window of time in development is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis .
This result is consistent with observations in the rat wherein <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> onset occurs with strict timing in the developmental history of most rods in vivo [ 44 ] .
Thus , through its regulation of <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> levels , or perhaps through control of the kinetics of the up-regulation of <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> beginning at about P6 , <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> may be regulating outer segment morphogenesis .
The similarty of the two cases may extend further .
At present , the closest <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> relative in Drosophila is Otd , the founding member of the class of homeobox genes to which <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> belongs .
Interestingly , in one hypomorphic allele of Drosophila otd , otduvi , photoreceptor morphogenesis is also disrupted [ 45 ] .
We found that there are many other genes that are dependent upon <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> .
Those that are expressed at a lower level in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retina , such as <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> and <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> , comprise many that are either enriched or specific to photoreceptors in their expression [ 35 ] .
They include enzymes that are important in lipid metabolism , protein folding and transport , as well as in other processes that one might envision would be important in building a structure such as the outer segment .
In situ hybridization using probes from this collection of genes has revealed that some of them have their RNA localized to the inner segment , a finding typical for proteins targeted to the outer segment .
Future analyses of the function of these genes might reveal their role in outer segment biogenesis .
Finally , polarization of photoreceptors was found to be largely intact , as was ciliogenesis .
Another LCA gene , <termsem="PR:000005848"> CRB1 </term> , and a related gene <termsem="PR:000005850"> CRB3 </term> , have been implicated in ciliogenesis in in vitro models [ 46 ] .
The Drosophila homologue of <termsem="PR:000005848"> CRB1 </term> , Crumbs , has been implicated in photoreceptor morphogenesis [ 47 ] .
However , the spontaneously occurring mouse mutant in <termsem="PR:000005848"> CRB1 </term> , the Rd8 mouse , develops shortened outer segments that subsequently degenerate [ 48 ] , suggesting that photoreceptor polarization and synaptogenesis are intact in this mutant .
While <termsem="PR:000005848"> CRB1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> have been both linked to LCA , further work is necessary to determine if their function is linked in retinal development .
Synaptogenesis is perturbed in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors .
The <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date .
The <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> - / - mouse develops a normal complement of photoreceptor terminals which then degenerate as the photoreceptors are lost [ 30 ] .
Also , similarly in <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> ( <termsem="PR:000001245"> Rho </term> ) and <termsem="PR:000000696"> cyclic nucleotide-gated channel , alpha-3 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000000696"> CNGA3 </term> ) double knockout mice ( <termsem="PR:000001245"> Rho </term> - / - , <termsem="PR:000000696"> CNGA3 </term> - / - ) , synapses are reported to form normally [ 49 ] .
These observations demonstrate that photoreceptor synaptogenesis can occur in the absence of outer segment formation .
In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in <termsem="PR:000013290"> peripherin </term> - / - mice , suggesting that minimal phototransduction is present in these mice , enough to drive activity at the photoreceptor synapse .
In vitro studies wherein synapse elements are formed in the absence of proper outer segment development and , therefore , possible absence of light-dependent photoreceptor activity , have indicated the independence of phototransduction and synapse formation , at least for the initial stages [ 50,51 ] .
These data then suggest that the fact that the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment formation .
A more likely explanation is that <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> plays a role in photoreceptor synapse formation , perhaps by regulating directly , or indirectly , important genes in this process .
Using immunohistochemistry , we examined the expression of common pre-synaptic terminal proteins , including <termsem="PR:000009311"> KIF3a </term> , <termsem="PR:000015849"> SV2 </term> , and <termsem="PR:000015890"> synaptophysin </term> , and were unable to observe qualitative differences between <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - and control tissue at P14 ( data not shown ) .
Examination of their RNA levels by SAGE showed no significant difference for all 3 genes , though very few tags were recovered from these genes and thus the analysis of RNA levels may not be significant [ 35 ] .
However , since other genes expressed in photoreceptors were significantly altered in their expression level in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mouse , there are many candidates that could be important for photoreceptor morphogenesis .
Tags from three genes from proteins expressed in photoreceptor terminals were found to be decreased in a statistically significant fashion , namely the <termsem="PR:000008536"> <termsem="PR:000008534"> HGF </term> - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate </term> , the <termsem="PR:000005877"> CRIPT </term> protein , and <termsem="PR:000015894"> synaptotagmin 1 </term> ( Blackshaw and Cepko , unpublished data ) .
An example of a gene that was increased in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retina is <termsem="PR:000017084"> HRG4 </term> ( a homologue of the C. elegans <termsem="PR:000017084"> Unc119 </term> gene ) ( Blackshaw and Cepko , unpublished data ) which encodes a component of the ribbon synapse [ 33 ] .
The fact that it is upregulated might indicate a response to the lack of proper terminal structures .
Several other genes encoding putative cytoskeletal elements also were increased ( e.g. <termsem="PR:000010142"> microtubule associated protein 4 </term> ) or decreased ( e.g. <termsem="PR:000005385"> cofilin 1 </term> ) in the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - retina , with P values of < .005 .
It is not known whether any of these genes are involved in building or regulating synaptic structures , but they are now genes that might lead to a better understanding of the construction and function of the relatively unique structure of the ribbon synapse .
Abnormal photoreceptor terminal formation was noted in a study that examined retinal development in the <termsem="PR:000009655"> laminin beta2 chain </term> - deficient mouse [ 52 ] .
Several pathologies were noted in these mice .
First , <termsem="PR:000009655"> laminin beta2 chain </term> - deficient mice displayed abnormal outer segment elongation , but a more mild phenotype than that of the <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice ; the outer segments were reduced by 50 % in length .
Also photoreceptor terminals were perturbed in <termsem="PR:000009655"> laminin beta2 </term> mutants , but again the phenotype was more subtle then that of <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice .
The outer plexiform layer of the <termsem="PR:000009655"> beta2 </term> - deficient retinas demonstrated only 7 % normal invaginating synapses , while the remainder had various pathologies , including floating synaptic ribbons , as seen here .
The mechanistic relationship of these two molecules , if any , in photoreceptor morphogenesis is unknown to date .
The mRNA for <termsem="PR:000009655"> laminin beta2 </term> was not detected in the SAGE study of the relative RNA levels in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - and <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> + / + and thus we can not comment on whether the levels of RNA for <termsem="PR:000009655"> laminin beta2 </term> were altered .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice are a model for LCA .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> has been implicated in three photoreceptor diseases that result in human blindness , cone-rod dystrophy2 , Leber 's congenital amaurosis , and retinitis pigmentosa ( for review , see [ 53 ] ) .
The cone-rod dystrophies ( CRDs ) are characterized by loss of cone-mediated vision in the first decade of life or later , with concomitant or subsequent loss of rod-mediated vision [ 54 ] .
Conversely , RP is notable for initial loss of rod function , followed by loss of cone-mediated vision [ 55 ] .
The majority of known genes responsible for human genetic blindness , encode proteins expressed almost exclusively , or exclusively , in photoreceptors , particularly in the outer segment [ 35 ] .
Many of these proteins are required for phototransduction or outer segment structure .
The mechanisms whereby mutations in rod-specific genes , such as <termsem="PR:000001245"> rhodopsin </term> , lead eventually to cone degeneration in RP remain obscure .
Mutations in <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> were the first , and still one of a very few examples of a transcription factor mutation leading to photoreceptor disease .
LCA is a disease in which there is little or no photoreceptor function in infancy ; thereby , likely developmental in etiology ( [ 17,56 ] for review ) .
The <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mouse may be an excellent model for studying the pathology of this disorder , particularly the subtype of the disorder where <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> mutations are involved .
The vast majority of histopathological studies of LCA in human tissue have been derived from adult patients with LCA where secondary changes are likely to be present .
Indeed in animal models of LCA , secondary reactive and/or degenerative changes occur early after the abnormal formation of retinal tissue [ 57 ] .
The only study in human tissue derived from a human 33-week retina with proposed <termsem="PR:000014179"> RPE65 </term> mutations was reported to have abnormal retinae at this early stage [ 24 ] .
These authors report cell loss , including thinning of the photoreceptor layer .
In addition , they claim in the text to have seen aberrant synaptic and inner retinal organization , although their examination of photoreceptor synapses unfortunately are not presented in the data section of the paper .
Given the scarcity of available human tissue , the characterization of the primary pathology of LCA will require animal models .
In the current study , we present data that argue that , in addition to outer segment morphogenesis , synaptogenesis may also be critically impaired in at least a subset of LCA .
<termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - mice were generated as reported elsewhere [ 34 ] .
<termsem="PR:000001245"> Rhodosin </term> - null mice [ 29 ] were obtained from Paul Sieving ( University of Michigan ) .
<termsem="PR:000013290"> Rds </term> mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratory .
Littermate <termsem="PR:000005904"> Crx </term> - / - and wildtype pups were perfused in 1 % formaldehyde and 0.5 % glutaraldehyde at various postnatal stages .
The eyes were then enucleated , and the cornea and lens were removed .
The eye cup was immersed in fixative ( 1 % formaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde ) for 3 to 4 hours at 4 C .
The sclera was then partially removed and the retinas were sliced into small pieces and fixed ( 1 % paraformaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde ) overnight at 4 C .
These procedures were found optimal for maintaining the structural integrity of the photoreceptor outer segments .
After fixing , the tissue was washed 2X in PBS for thirty minutes per wash .
The tissue was then postfixed in a 1 % osmium tetroxide/1 .5 % potassium ferrocyanide mixture for 2 hours at 4 C .
Staining was carried out for 30 minutes in 1 % uranyl acetate in maleate buffer ( pH = 6.0 ) at room temperature followed by 1 % tannic acid in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH = 7.4 ) for thirty minutes .
The specimens were then dehydrated and embedded in Epon/Araldite .
Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined in a Jeol JEM-1200EX electron microscope .
