The Zebrafish moonshine Gene Encodes <termsem="GO:0006350"> Transcriptional </term> Intermediary Factor 1 , an Essential Regulator of <termsem="GO:0030097"> Hematopoiesis </term> .
<termsem="GO:0030097"> Hematopoiesis </term> is precisely orchestrated by lineage-specific <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> proteins that <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> in concert with <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivators </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0003714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> corepressors </term> </term> .
Mutations in the zebrafish moonshine ( mon ) gene specifically disrupt both embryonic and adult <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> , resulting in severe red blood cell aplasia .
We report that mon encodes the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> intermediary factor 1 ( TIF1 ) ( or TRIM33 ) , a member of the TIF1 family of <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivators </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0003714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> corepressors </term> </term> .
During <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> progenitor cells in mon mutants fail to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> normal levels of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , including gata1 , and undergo <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
Three different mon mutant alleles each encode premature <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codons , and enforced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of wild-type tif1 mRNA rescues <termsem="GO:0035162"> embryonic hematopoiesis </term> in homozygous mon mutants .
Surprisingly , a high level of zygotic tif1 mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> delineates ventral mesoderm during <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> stem cell and progenitor formation prior to gata1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Transplantation studies reveal that tif1 functions in a cell-autonomous manner during the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of erythroid precursors .
Studies in murine erythroid cell lines demonstrate that Tif1 protein is <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> within novel nuclear foci , and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> decreases during erythroid <termsem="GO:0048469"> cell maturation </term> .
Our results establish a major role for this <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> intermediary factor in the differentiation of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells in vertebrates .
<termsem="GO:0030097"> Hematopoiesis </term> involves the coordinated <termsem="GO:0008283"> processes of cell proliferation </term> and differentiation of a relatively small number of progenitor cells into billions of circulating red and white blood cells ( Thisse and Zon 2002 ) .
<termsem="GO:0030097"> Hematopoiesis </term> in vertebrates , from zebrafish to humans , is an evolutionarily conserved program that <termsem="GO:0032502"> produces </term> two waves of stem or progenitor cells that differ both in their embryonic origins and in the lineages of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> blood cells <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> ( Palis and Yoder 2001 ; Orkin and Zon 2002 ; Galloway and Zon 2003 ) .
The first , or primitive , wave of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> originates from ventral mesoderm and gives rise to progenitor cells that <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> in embryonic blood islands .
The primitive wave of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> produces </term> a burst of embryonic erythrocytes and macrophages .
The second , or definitive , wave of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> arises from <termsem="GO:0017145"> self-renewing </term> stem cells that <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> primarily in the intraembryonic aorta -- gonad -- mesonephros region .
These definitive <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> stem cells seed the later <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> marrow spaces , to <termsem="GO:0032502"> produce </term> all lineages of adult blood cells , including definitive erythrocytes , myeloid cells , and lymphocytes .
We have undertaken a genetic approach to characterize genes that <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> using the zebrafish as a model system ( Thisse and Zon 2002 ) .
As part of a large-scale forward genetic screen , we previously identified bloodless zebrafish mutants that failed to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> the erythroid <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> gata1 normally in embryonic <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> precursors ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) .
We named one of these zebrafish genes moonshine ( mon ) , and another group named a noncomplementing allele vampire ( Weinstein et al. 1996 ) .
Here , we have determined that mutations in the mon gene cause a disruption in both primitive embryonic and definitive adult hematopoiesis , resulting in a severe loss of erythroid cells .
Erythroid progenitor cells in mon mutants are initially present , but fail to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> normal levels of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> and undergo <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
Positional cloning identifies the mon gene as the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> intermediary factor 1 ( TIF1 ) , a member of the TIF1 family of <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> coactivators </term> </term> and corepressors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Friedman et al. 1996 ; Kim et al. 1996 ; Venturini et al. 1999 ; Peng et al. 2002 ) .
The three members of the vertebrate TIF1 family (  ,  , and  ) are large nuclear proteins that each contain an N-terminal RBCC or TRIM domain ( Reymond et al. 2001 ) composed of a RING finger , two B-boxes , and a coiled-coil domain .
TIF1 family members also contain a C-terminal plant homeodomain finger and bromodomain that are characteristic of <termsem="GO:0006338"> chromatin remodeling </term> factors .
TIF1 has been shown to associate with a variety of ligand - <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> nuclear <termsem="GO:0005179"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hormone </term> </term> receptors ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ) and function as a <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivator </term> </term> for <termsem="GO:0003708"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> retinoic acid receptors </term> </term> ( Zhong et al. 1999 ) .
TIF1 has been shown to act as a <termsem="GO:0003714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> corepressor </term> </term> for the large family of Krppel-associated box ( KRAB ) domain zinc-finger <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> ( Friedman et al. 1996 ; Abrink et al. 2001 ) .
In contrast , TIF1 does not associate directly with either <termsem="GO:0004879"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> nuclear receptors </term> </term> or KRAB domains that <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to the other TIF1 family members ( Venturini et al. 1999 ; Abrink et al. 2001 ) .
Biochemical studies also demonstrate that TIF1 <termsem="GO:0022607"> forms </term> both homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with TIF1 but not with TIF1 ( Peng et al. 2002 ) .
The murine Tif1 and Tif1 genes have not yet been subjected to gene targeting experiments , whereas analysis of mouse mutants demonstrates that Tif1 is required for postimplantation <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> and mesoderm <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> in particular ( Cammas et al. 2000 ) .
Taken together , these studies suggest that a major function of TIF1 family members is to link <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> proteins with other <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivators </term> </term> or <termsem="GO:0003714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> corepressors </term> </term> during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Our studies establish that tif1 functions as an essential regulator of embryonic and adult hematopoiesis in vertebrates .
Cell transplantation studies demonstrate that tif1 acts in a cell-autonomous manner during <termsem="GO:0035162"> embryonic hematopoiesis </term> .
The tif1 gene is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> specifically in ventral mesoderm and <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> progenitors , then <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> as erythroid <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> occurs .
Tif1 protein <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> to a novel class of nuclear bodies in both primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and erythroleukemia cell lines .
Taken together , our studies demonstrate that Tif1 is required for normal erythroid <termsem="GO:0048468"> cell development </term> and survival .
The Zebrafish mon Gene Is Essential for Both Primitive and Definitive <termsem="GO:0048821"> Erythropoiesis </term> .
In order to determine when the mon gene is required in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , we first examined <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in zebrafish homozygous mon mutant embryos .
During <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , homozygous zebrafish mon mutants have no red blood cells ( RBCs ) visible in circulation ( Ransom et al. 1996 ; Weinstein et al. 1996 ) .
The mon mutants initiate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of gata1 in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells around the five-somite stage , similar to wild-type embryos ( data not shown ) ; however , based on TUNEL staining , the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> erythroid cells undergo <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> from the 12-somite stage to 22 h postfertilization ( hpf ) ( Figure 1A and 1B , arrows ) .
At 12 somites , gata1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is only slightly reduced .
By 18 -- 22 hpf , <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> - specific markers such as gata1 , scl , gata2 , and ikaros are not detected in the embryonic blood island ( Figure 1A and 1B ; unpublished data ) .
The <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells are thus correctly <termsem="GO:0001708"> specified </term> early during the development of mon mutant embryos , but these precursors undergo <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> .
Based on <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of c-myb and rag1 ( Figure 1B , arrows ) , mon mutants have normal myeloid and lymphoid <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , respectively .
In addition to the deficit of RBCs in mon mutants , there is a prominent loss of fin-fold and tail mesenchyme ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) .
TUNEL staining of mon mutants demonstrates extensive apoptosis of mesenchymal cells in the trunk and tail bud regions ( Figure 1A and 1B , arrows ) .
The mon gene is thus required for normal development and survival of both <termsem="GO:0045165"> committed </term> erythroid progenitor cells and posterior mesenchymal cells .
We next examined definitive <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> in rare surviving homozygous adult zebrafish mon mutants .
Mutations in mon are generally <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> by 10 to 14 d of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) , although rare mon homozygous mutants ( approximately 1 in 500 bloodless embryos ) of all tested alleles survive to adulthood .
Adult mon mutants show cardiac hypertrophy , presumably due to the severe anemia leading to a high output state ( Figure 2 ) .
In wild-type zebrafish , the adult site of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> is the kidney ( Al Adhami and Kunz 1977 ) , which contains erythroid , lymphoid , and myeloid populations at various stages of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( Bennett et al. 2001 ) .
In mon homozygous mutants , there is a severe block in <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> at the proerythroblast stage ( Figure 2 ) , whereas the differentiation of myeloid cells is normal ( unpublished data ) .
This demonstrates that the mon gene product acts during both primitive and definitive <termsem="GO:0048821"> erythropoiesis </term> .
Positional Cloning Identifies mon as the Zebrafish Ortholog of Mammalian TIF1 .
We identified the mon gene by positional cloning using a panel of 2,200 diploid mutants collected from Tbingen background ( TU ) / WIK strain hybrid parents carrying the montg234 allele .
The mon mutant gene was positioned on Chromosome 8 between microsatellite markers z987 and z11001 ( Figure 3A ) ( Knapik et al. 1998 ) .
For positional cloning purposes , over 12,000 polymorphic markers were screened using amplified fragment length polymorphism ( AFLP ) ( Ransom and Zon 1999 ) , and 36 markers within the interval were isolated .
One of these , MA3 , was found to be 0.3 cM from the gene ( Figure 3A ) and was utilized as the starting point of a chromosomal walk .
A critical P1 bacterial artificial chromosome clone ( PAC ) , 107N19 , was obtained that spanned the genetic interval .
Two simple sequence conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) markers found on this PAC clone flank the critical genetic interval .
The marker 80M12-T7 maps two recombinants out of 4,400 <termsem="GO:0007126"> meioses </term> telomeric of the mutation , and the marker 157J23-T7 maps one <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> centromic of the mutation ( Figure 3A ) .
The end sequences and SSCP markers of PAC 107N19 are found in the zebrafish genomic sequence contig ctg23107 ( http://www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/ ) containing a predicted zebrafish TIF1 family gene .
This PAC was <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> to a kidney cDNA library , resulting in the isolation of four clones that represented the same gene .
The mon gene encodes a member of the TIF1 family of <termsem="GO:0003712"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> cofactors </term> </term> ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
The coding sequence of mon is most similar to human TIF ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Friedman et al. 1996 ; Venturini et al. 1999 ) , and the locations of exon boundaries are conserved between the zebrafish and human genes ( unpublished data ) .
The mon locus on zebrafish Chromosome 8 is also predicted to be syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 1p that contains the TIF1 gene based on the conserved locations of 12 other orthologous gene pairs , including NRAS , mapped to these regions in human and zebrafish ( Barbazuk et al. 2000 ) .
Therefore , based on sequence similarity and chromosomal location , the zebrafish mon gene is the likely ortholog of the human TIF1 gene .
We have identified ethyl-nitrosourea ( ENU ) - induced point mutations in three alleles of mon ( Figure 3C and 3D ) , each of which <termsem="GO:0009058"> generates </term> a premature <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codon .
The montb222b and montg234 alleles have a severe phenotype with no circulating blood cells .
In contrast , the monm262 allele has 10 -- 100 circulating blood cells by 48 hpf , in comparison to the approximately 3,000 RBCs in the circulation of wild-type or heterozygous embryos at the same time point .
The monm262 allele was found to encode a premature <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codon at position E40 , which would encode a putative protein of only 40 amino acids .
Although this mutation would be expected to lead to a complete loss of mon gene product , another methionine is found downstream at amino acid position 104 .
In vitro <termsem="GO:0006412"> translation </term> experiments in reticulocyte lysates demonstrate reinitiation of <termsem="GO:0006412"> translation </term> from this methionine ( unpublished data ) .
Therefore , the hypomorphic larval phenotype of the monm262 allele is likely due to partial loss of mon function or <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
The presence of mutations in each of the mon alleles indicates that defective Tif1 function is the cause of the mon phenotype .
In order to determine whether tif1 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> mesoderm , we next examined zebrafish embryos by whole-mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> ( Figure 4A ) .
tif1 mRNA is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> maternally and is found throughout the embryo during blastula stages .
During <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> and epiboly stages , zygotic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of mon is highest in the mesendoderm of the germ ring .
At tail bud and early somite stages a high level of tif1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> delineates a horseshoe-shaped population of ventral/lateral mesoderm that will give rise to blood and also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expresses </term> stem cell leukemiahematopoietic <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> ( scl ) ( Liao et al. 1997 ) .
This group of cells continues to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> tif1 and scl while it converges and <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> the embryonic blood island ( Detrich et al. 1995 ) .
The tif1 gene is also highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the central nervous system as well as the mesenchyme of the trunk and tail .
Homozygous montg234 mutants have a greatly reduced amount of tif1 mRNA in all tissues consistent with <termsem="GO:0000184"> nonsense-mediated message decay </term> .
Thus , zebrafish tif1 is specifically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in ventral mesoderm and putative hemangioblasts prior to and during the embryonic stages when <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> progenitors are undergoing <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in mon mutants .
We also compared the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of zebrafish mon to mouse Tif1 ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Mouse Tif1 is highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in erythroid blood islands of the yolk sac , and it is subsequently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the fetal liver at a high level , and in other tissues , including the central nervous system .
Taken together these results strongly suggest that zebrafish mon and mouse Tif1 are orthologs that function during <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> .
Given that mammalian TIF1 has been shown to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> hetero-oligomers with Tif1 ( Peng et al. 2002 ) , we searched for additional TIF1 family members in zebrafish to compare with tif1 .
Using zebrafish <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> sequence tag ( EST ) sequences , we designed primers to <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR amplify a TIF1-related cDNA from embryonic 10-hpf and 24-hpf RNA .
This cDNA encodes a predicted zebrafish ortholog of human TIF1 based on predicted amino acid sequences ( see Figure 3B ) .
In addition , zebrafish tif1 ESTs map to LG4 in a region predicted to be syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 7 that contains the TIF1 gene based on the conserved locations of eight other orthologous gene pairs , including SEMA3A , mapped to these regions in human and zebrafish ( Barbazuk et al. 2000 ) .
We next compared the embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern of tif1 mRNA to tif1 by in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
Like mammalian TIF1 ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Niederreither et al. 1999 ) , the predicted zebrafish tif1 gene is broadly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> ( see Figure 4A ) .
At five somites , zebrafish tif1 does not display the relatively high <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the horseshoe-shaped region of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> mesoderm seen with tif1 .
At later stages , tif1 is evenly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout most of the embryo , including the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> blood islands .
Therefore , tif1 is coexpressed in the same cells with tif1 and may therefore be available to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> hetero-oligomers in vivo .
Forced <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of tif1 Rescues <termsem="GO:0030097"> Hematopoiesis </term> in mon Mutants .
To further confirm that a mutation in the zebrafish tif1 gene is responsible for the mon mutant phenotype we performed embryo rescue experiments ( Figure 5A ; Table 1 ) .
Microinjection of synthetic wild-type mon mRNA at the one-cell stage rescues the formation of embryonic erythrocytes in genotyped mutant embryos without causing obvious defects in <termsem="GO:0009880"> embryonic patterning </term> or organogenesis .
At 4 d of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , 70 % ( n = 10 ) of montg234 mutants show significant ( greater than 200 cells in comparison to a wild-type estimate of 3,000 cells ) rescue of circulating hemoglobinized RBCs in comparison to control sibling mutants ( n = 75 ) .
Based on the correction of the jagged fin-fold phenotype ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) , the mesenchymal cells are rescued to a similar extent as the anemia ( unpublished data ) .
Overexpression of mon did not result in <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> blood cell numbers in wild-type embryos and was not toxic at doses that rescue the phenotype of mon mutants ( unpublished data ) .
Since there were no <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> or ectopic blood populations in the embryos , these rescue experiments suggest that mon functions as a permissive factor required for <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> .
Marrow Transplantation Rescues <termsem="GO:0048821"> Erythropoiesis </term> in mon Mutants .
The high levels of tif1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in erythroid cells suggest that it functions as a cell-autonomous regulator of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells .
In order to test this hypothesis , we transplanted wild-type adult zebrafish kidney marrow cells carrying a gata1 : green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) transgene into 48-hpf mon mutant embryos ( Figure 5B ; Table 2 ) .
The gata1 : GFP transgene makes use of the gata1 promoter to <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> GFP <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and can thus be used to mark donor-derived erythroid cells ( Long et al. 1997 ) .
Untransplanted mutant embryos have no embryonic blood cells in circulation .
Following transplantation , mutant host embryos were observed daily for 2 wk .
Of 191 mutant embryos injected , 129 ( 68 % ) showed GFP + cells in circulation 2 d later .
Many recipients showed robust increases in donor-derived cells over the observation period .
Of 81 recipients initially scored as having less than ten GFP + cells at day 2 posttransplant , 13 ( 16 % ) of these demonstrated a marked increase in erythroid cells with 100 -- 1,000 GFP + cells in circulation 6 d later .
By day 10 , these transplanted embryos showed approximately 3,000 cells in circulation , similar to the number of blood cells in normal embryos .
Despite robust reconstitution of blood cells , mutant recipients did not inflate their swim bladders and thus failed to survive longer than nontransplanted sibling controls , all <termsem="GO:0016265"> dying </term> by 3 wk of age .
In contrast , 13/35 ( 37 % ) heterozygous montg234 transplants survived to early adulthood .
Similar transplants of wild-type cells can fully rescue vlad tepes ( gata1 ) mutants ( Traver et al. 2003 ) .
Therefore , the results of cell transplantations suggests that tif1 plays a cell-autonomous role in erythroid cells , and its role in nonhematopoietic tissues , such as trunk mesenchyme or the nervous system , is also required for embryo survival .
Tif1 in Punctate Nuclear Foci Is <termsem="GO:0050793"> <termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmentally </term> Regulated </term> .
In order to examine the <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular distribution </term> of Tif1 protein , we generated an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal 15 amino acids conserved in human TIF1 and mouse Tif1 .
Immunofluorescence of mouse embryo fibroblast nuclei with the anti-Tif1 antiserum demonstrates that Tif1 is <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> in small nuclear foci ( Figure 6A ) .
The localization of Tif1 protein appears different from the more diffuse nuclear patterns typically seen in studies of Tif1 ( Remboutsika et al. 2002 ) or TIF1 ( Cammas et al. 2002 ) .
A recent report demonstrates that TIF1 associates with heterochromatin-containing foci after retinoic acid treatment or serum starvation ( Cammas et al. 2002 ) .
Thus , localization or <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the TIF1 proteins may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> during distinct <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental processes </term> or by environmental cues .
The nuclear foci that contain Tif1 do not colocalize with two markers of heterochromatin , HP1 protein and DAPI staining of DNA ( Figure 6A ) .
Furthermore , Tif1 does not colocalize with promyelocytic leukemia gene product ( PML ) nuclear bodies , <termsem="GO:0006281"> DNA repair </term> complexes that contain Mre11 , or <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> complexes containing TFII-B ( unpublished data ) .
We next examined the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tif1 protein during the differentiation of G1E cells , a murine erythroleukemia cell line that can terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> into erythrocytes when a Gata1 : <termsem="GO:0030284"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> estrogen receptor </term> </term> fusion protein is <termsem="GO:0050821"> stabilized </term> in <termsem="GO:0043627"> response to estrogen exposure </term> ( Weiss et al. 1997 ) .
Western blot analysis demonstrated that Tif1 protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> decreases with terminal erythroid <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( Figure 6B ) .
Consistent with this finding , after 24 hpf , zebrafish mon mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> falls during the terminal maturation of the primitive erythroid cells ( unpublished data ) .
In two different murine erythroleukemia cell lines ( MEL and G1E ) , Tif1 is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in nuclear foci , and even though the overall Tif1 protein level is reduced , this nuclear foci <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> does not change with <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( unpublished data ) .
This provides further support for the hypothesis that Tif1 acts within novel nuclear foci , during erythroid <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
The zebrafish is an excellent model system to elucidate the molecular machinery <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlling </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> during <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> ( Thisse and Zon 2002 ; Galloway and Zon 2003 ) .
As part of a large-scale forward genetic screen , we originally identified a complementation group of independent mutant alleles in the zebrafish gene that we named moonshine ( Ransom et al. 1996 ) .
Positional cloning was used to identify the mon gene , establishing a critical role for a <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> intermediary factor , Tif1 , during <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic development </term> .
The mon Gene Encodes the Zebrafish Ortholog of Mammalian TIF1 .
Our results strongly support the conclusion that we have positionally cloned the zebrafish mon gene correctly , and it is the ortholog of mammalian Tif1 .
Tif1 is present in the critical genetic interval encompassing a single approximately 50-kb PAC clone defined by linkage analysis ( see Figure 3 ) .
Sequence analysis indicates that zebrafish tif1 is most similar in predicted amino acid sequence and intron/exon structure compared to the predicted orthologous human and mouse genes .
Zebrafish tif1 is located in a region of zebrafish Chromosome 8 syntenic to the region of human Chromosome 1 containing TIF1 .
We identified point mutations in tif1 from three different alleles of mon that each result in premature <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codons and <termsem="GO:0006402"> mRNA decay </term> .
In addition , tif1/Tif1 is highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells throughout <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> in both zebrafish and mouse ( see Figure 4 ) .
And as predicted , forced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of wild-type tif1 mRNA efficiently rescues <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> in mon mutants and does not perturb hematopoiesis in wild-type embryos ( see Figure 5 ) .
We have also cloned the predicted zebrafish ortholog of tif1 , which is more uniformly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in zebrafish embryos like mammalian TIF1 ( Le Douarin et al. 1995 ; Niederreither et al. 1999 ) ( see Figures 3A and 4A ) and may therefore be available to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> hetero-oligomers with Tif1 protein in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells .
Comparing available zebrafish and mammalian TIF1-predicted amino acid sequences , it appears that the Tif1 orthologs are the most highly conserved family members while the Tif1 sequences are relatively more divergent .
We have not found a Tif1 ortholog , thus far , in the zebrafish or fugu genome or EST sequences .
It is possible that Tif1 , like the KRAB domain <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> it <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to , may be present only in tetrapods ( Urrutia 2003 ) .
However , more complete genome sequences will be needed to confirm this hypothesis .
Based on our analysis of zebrafish mon mutants , it is reasonable to predict that Tif1 , the most evolutionarily conserved TIF1 family member , plays a similarly essential role in human and mouse <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> .
Mutations in tif1 Cause <termsem="GO:0006915"> Apoptosis </term> of Erythroid Progenitors .
Our examination of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , and marrow histology in mon mutants demonstrates that early erythroid progenitors are <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in homozygous mutants , but they fail to properly <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> and instead undergo <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> ( see Figure 1 ) .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of gata1 appears to initiate normally in the <termsem="GO:0045165"> committed </term> erythroid cells of mon mutants .
However , the cells are abnormal prior to the complete loss of gata1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
TUNEL-positive <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells are abundant by the 12-somite stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , and by 22 hpf all <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> is extinguished .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of </term> marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> genes </term> , including scl and gata2 , characteristic of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> stem cells and primitive <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> progenitors , are also not detected in the embryonic blood islands of mutants at 22 hpf .
This indicates that the mutant <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> cells are not blocked prior to <termsem="GO:0045165"> commitment </term> to the erythroid lineage , but instead <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> as abnormal erythroid cells and undergo <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , similar to gata1-deficient erythroid cells ( Fujiwara et al. 1996 ; Lyons et al. 2002 ) .
Defective <termsem="GO:0048821"> erythropoiesis </term> and severe anemia were also observed in rare surviving homozygous mutant mon adults , demonstrating that tif1 is also required in definitive <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> ( see Figure 2 ) .
The zygotic phenotypes of mon mutants may not reveal the function of maternally inherited Tif1 .
Maternally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> zebrafish Tif1 may play roles in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> or other aspects of <termsem="GO:0048513"> organogenesis </term> that are not detectable due to the presence of wild-type mRNA in eggs <termsem="GO:0018991"> laid </term> by heterozygous mothers .
Analysis of the offspring of homozygous mon mutant female zebrafish will aid in defining the function of this maternal mRNA .
The present analysis of zygotic mon mutants provides data that are consistent with the conclusion that tif1 is essential for <termsem="GO:0048821"> erythropoiesis </term> but do not rule out essential functions in other <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> lineages .
The <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> phenotype of mon mutants resembles the loss of erythroid cells seen in both mouse Gata1 knockout embryos and zebrafish vlad tepes ( gata1 ) mutant embryos ( Fujiwara et al. 1996 ; Lyons et al. 2002 ) .
In an effort to determine if there is a genetic relationship between mon and gata1 , we tested their ability to rescue <termsem="GO:0048821"> erythropoiesis </term> .
Both injection of gata1 mRNA into mon homozygous mutant embryos and injection of tif1 mRNA into gata1 knock-down embryos failed to rescue <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> ( unpublished data ) .
We also tested for a direct interaction between Tif1 and Gata1 proteins by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays and found no association ( unpublished data ) .
Although the mutations in each of these genes <termsem="GO:0007050"> arrest </term> cells at a similar stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , our results suggest that gata1 and tif1 act independently .
This does not rule out the possibility that parallel genetic pathways involving gata1 and tif1 , operating together , <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> gene <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> within blood cells .
The Role of Tif1 in Primitive and Definitive <termsem="GO:0048821"> Erythropoiesis </term> .
Taken together , our data suggest that tif1 is required as a permissive cofactor for the erythroid lineage-specific control of <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> .
We reasonably predict that Tif1 protein functions as a <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> intermediary factor in <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoietic </term> progenitor cells given that both TIF1 ( Zhong et al. 1999 ) and TIF1 ( Friedman et al. 1996 ; Abrink et al. 2001 ) have been shown to act as intermediary factors that positively or <termsem="GO:0048519"> negatively regulate </term> gene <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> .
These studies indicate that TIF1 and TIF1 act as <termsem="GO:0032947"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> scaffolds </term> </term> that link different classes of <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> proteins and chromatin-associated proteins into larger <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> complexes .
Tif1 is detected within nuclear foci ( see Figure 6 ) , which , based on our analysis , do not appear to correspond to several types of previously described nuclear bodies , including PML bodies .
<termsem="GO:0051179"> Localization </term> of Tif1 to these nuclear bodies may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by <termsem="GO:0043687"> posttranslational modification </term> such as <termsem="GO:0016925"> SUMO modification </term> that is required for PML to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> PML nuclear domains ( Zhong et al. 2000a , 2000b ; Best et al. 2002 ) .
These foci may serve as <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> points where Tif1 <termsem="GO:0022607"> forms </term> multisubunit complexes with <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> and their other essential <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivators </term> </term> or <termsem="GO:0003714"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> corepressors </term> </term> , during the early stages of erythroid <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
It will be important to determine the identity of Tif1-interacting proteins in nuclear foci and establish how they function with Tif1 to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> blood <termsem="GO:0048468"> cell development </term> .
