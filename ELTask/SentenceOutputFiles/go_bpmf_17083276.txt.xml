CAF-1 Is Essential for Heterochromatin Organization in Pluripotent Embryonic Cells .
During mammalian <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , chromatin dynamics and epigenetic marking are important for genome reprogramming .
Recent data suggest an important role for the <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> machinery in this process .
To analyze the role of <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> factor 1 ( CAF-1 ) during pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> a mouse line carrying a targeted mutation in the gene encoding its large subunit , p150CAF-1 .
Loss of p150CAF-1 in homozygous mutants leads to <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> arrest at the 16-cell stage .
Absence of p150CAF-1 in these embryos results in severe alterations in the nuclear organization of constitutive heterochromatin .
We provide evidence that in wild-type embryos , heterochromatin domains are extensively reorganized between the two-cell and blastocyst stages .
In p150CAF-1 mutant 16-cell stage embryos , the altered organization of heterochromatin displays similarities to the structure of heterochromatin in two - to four-cell stage wild-type embryos , suggesting that CAF-1 is required for the maturation of heterochromatin during preimplantation <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
In embryonic stem cells , depletion of p150CAF-1 using <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNA interference </term> results in the mislocalization , loss of clustering , and <termsem="GO:0051312"> decondensation </term> of pericentric heterochromatin domains .
Furthermore , loss of CAF-1 in these cells results in the alteration of epigenetic <termsem="GO:0016571"> histone methylation </term> marks at the level of pericentric heterochromatin .
These alterations of heterochromatin are not found in p150CAF-1-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts , which are cells that are already <termsem="GO:0045165"> lineage committed </term> , suggesting that CAF-1 is specifically required for heterochromatin organization in pluripotent embryonic cells .
Our findings underline the role of the <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> machinery in <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlling </term> the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of the genome in early embryos and embryonic stem cells .
Chromatin is the support of our genetic information .
It is composed of numerous repeated units called nucleosomes , in which DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins .
Modifications in the composition and biochemical properties of nucleosomes play major roles in the <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of genome function .
Such modifications are termed `` epigenetic '' when they are inherited across <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell divisions </term> and confer new information to chromatin , in addition to the genetic information provided by DNA .
It is usually believed that during genome <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> , the basic <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> machinery <termsem="GO:0022607"> builds up </term> `` nave '' nucleosomes , and , in a subsequent step , nucleosomes are selectively <termsem="GO:0043412"> modified </term> by a series of enzymes to acquire epigenetic information .
Here , the authors studied the role of a basic <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> factor ( CAF-1 ) in mouse embryonic stem cells and early embryos .
Surprisingly , they show that CAF-1 confers epigenetic information to specific genomic regions .
In addition , this study revealed that CAF-1 is required for the proper <termsem="GO:0050000"> spatial organization of chromosomes </term> in the nucleus .
This new knowledge may contribute to better understanding the role of chromatin in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell identity and plasticity .
During mouse pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , the genome undergoes a series of major epigenetic changes required for embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , the maintenance of totipotency , and the first <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation events </term> [ 1,2 ] .
While many studies have established the importance of <termsem="GO:0006306"> DNA methylation </term> in epigenetic reprogramming , recent data point to a crucial role of chromatin in this process [ 3 -- 5 ] .
Yet we know very little about the role of <termsem="GO:0016570"> histone modifying </term> enzymes , <termsem="GO:0006338"> chromatin remodeling </term> factors , and histone chaperones during pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , or in stem cells derived from early embryos [ 6 ] .
A subset of identified histone chaperones and <termsem="GO:0006338"> chromatin remodeling </term> complexes can collaborate to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0006334"> nucleosome assembly </term> in vitro and are therefore in a strategic position to <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> and maturation during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 7,8 ] .
Among histone chaperones , <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> factor 1 ( CAF-1 ) is a three-subunit ( p150 , p60 , and p48 ) complex which <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> histone H3 and H4 deposition onto newly <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesized </term> DNA during <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> or <termsem="GO:0006281"> DNA repair </term> [ 9,10 ] .
Specifically , CAF-1 deposits the histone H3 variant H3 .1 into chromatin , in a pathway coupled to DNA <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> , whereas a second histone chaperone , HIRA , is involved in the deposition of the H3 .3 variant in a DNA <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> independent pathway [ 11,12 ] .
In addition to this specific <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> activity , CAF-1 interacts with several proteins present in heterochromatin , including heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) and MBD1 , a <termsem="GO:0008327"> methyl-CpG binding </term> domain protein that <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruits </term> <termsem="GO:0004407"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> histone deacetylase </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressive </term> <termsem="GO:0042054"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> histone methyltransferase </term> </term> activities [ 13 -- 15 ] .
Furthermore , p150CAF-1 is required to ensure a <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> - specific pool of HP1 molecules at <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> sites in pericentric heterochromatin during mid-late <termsem="GO:0051320"> S phase </term> [ 16 ] .
Taken together , these data suggest roles for CAF-1 in the <termsem="GO:0031507"> formation of heterochromatin </term> and in the heritability of epigenetic traits .
While the function of this evolutionary conserved histone chaperone has been studied extensively biochemically , we still lack information concerning its importance during early <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in mammals and in pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
Here , we have analyzed the importance of CAF-1 during early mouse <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> by genetic ablation and in ES cells by depletion using <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNA interference </term> ( <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> ) .
We show that CAF-1 is essential for viability in early mouse embryos and ES cells .
We provide evidence that CAF-1 is required for the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of heterochromatin domains in pluripotent embryonic cells .
We used gene targeting in ES cells to delete exon 3 in the Chaf1a gene , which encodes p150CAF-1 ( Figure 1A ) .
Chaf1a + /  mice were <termsem="GO:0007567"> born </term> at a Mendelian frequency , were of normal size and weight , displayed no obvious abnormalities , and were fertile .
Crossing heterozygous mice failed to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> viable newborn Chaf1a  /  mice .
Furthermore , no homozygous Chaf1a  /  embryos were detected at any of the post - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> stages .
However , we could detect Chaf1a  /  embryos at embryonic day 4 ( E4 ) using a PCR strategy ( Figure 1B ) .
They represent only 10 % of E4 embryos obtained from Chaf1a + /  mice intercrosses , suggesting that more than half of the homozygous mutant embryos had degenerated before this stage .
Moreover , mutant embryos contained only eight to 16 cells at the E4 stage , instead of 32 cells observed for wild-type or heterozygous blastocysts ( Figure 1C and 1D ) .
Further analysis by light microscopy using immunofluorescence ( IF ) allowed us to compare wild-type and p150CAF-1-depleted embryos .
A loss of p150CAF-1 staining could not be detected before the eight-cell stage ( unpublished data ) suggesting that maternally contributed protein is present in the embryo up to the four-cell stage .
Thus , depletion of p150CAF-1 protein from this stage allows a maximum of two additional <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell divisions </term> before <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> arrest .
Strikingly , we found that the nuclear organization of heterochromatin appeared abnormal in the nuclei of Chaf1a  /  embryos .
Pericentric heterochromatin , the major component of constitutive heterochromatin , can easily be visualized in <termsem="GO:0051325"> interphase </term> nuclei by the fluorochrome DAPI and by immunostaining with HP1 [ 16,17 -- 19 ] .
In wild-type blastocysts and in mouse somatic cells , pericentric heterochromatin domains cluster together and <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> higher-order chromatin structures called chromocenters [ 20 ] , which are visualized as DAPI-dense foci ( Figure 1C ) .
These structures were not detected in Chaf1a  /  embryos ( Figure 1D ) .
Since chromatin architecture and higher-order structures are important for genome function [ 21 ] , we decided to characterize this phenotype in more detail .
For this purpose , we examined the status of heterochromatin organization between the two-cell and blastocyst stages .
In two-cell stage wild-type embryos , DAPI staining is diffuse and fibrillar , with regions of higher density around the nucleolar precursor bodies ( Figure 1E ) .
Heterochromatin domains are progressively <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembled </term> into DAPI-dense foci between the four-cell and 32-cell blastocyst stages ( Figure 1F ) .
<termsem="GO:0051179"> Localization </term> of HP1 confirmed that the structures visualized by DAPI staining correspond to constitutive heterochromatin ( Figure 1E ) .
Thus , the nuclear organization of heterochromatin is dramatically modified during pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , between the two-cell and blastocyst stages .
In Chaf1a  /  E4 embryos , which are arrested between the eight - and 16-cell stage , DAPI-dense foci were barely detectable ( Figure 1D ) .
Instead , DAPI staining was diffuse within the nucleus , with regions of higher density around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nuclei ( Figure 1D ) .
<termsem="GO:0051179"> Localization </term> of HP1 showed a diffuse pattern similar to the DAPI , with some enrichment at the nuclear periphery , and around the nucleoli ( Figure 1D ) .
This abnormal organization of heterochromatin in Chaf1a  /  embryos is reminiscent of the heterochromatin organization found in two - to four-cell stage wild-type embryos ( compare Figure 1D and 1F ) .
These data evidence a key role for p150CAF-1 during pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , and reveal that this protein is required for the proper 3-D organization of heterochromatin within embryonic cell nuclei .
Next , we wondered whether a similar requirement for CAF-1 could also be observed in ES cells , which are derived from the blastocyst inner cell mass .
Given the early <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> arrest observed in Chaf1a  /  embryos , such cells could not be derived directly from null embryos , and we thus used an <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> strategy ( Figure 2A ) .
p150CAF-1 knockdown in ES cells was quantified by Western blot analysis and IF .
( Figure S1 ) .
p150CAF-1 <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> - depleted ES cells displayed a phenotype very similar to the cells of Chaf1a  /  E4 mice .
DAPI-dense foci were lost , and we observed diffuse HP1 and DAPI staining around the nucleoli and at the periphery of the nucleus ( Figure 2B ) .
This result indicates that p150CAF-1 is essential for nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cells in a similar way to early pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> embryos .
Surprisingly , we did not observe this severe alteration in heterochromatin organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) following p150CAF-1 depletion by <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> .
p150CAF-1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> ( unpublished data ) , but did not alter the clustering of heterochromatin domains ( Figures 2C and S2 ) .
Similarly , p150CAF-1 depletion in 3T3 cells did not affect heterochromatin organization [ 16 ] .
These observations reveal a specific function for CAF-1 in the early embryo and ES cells .
We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF-1 in ES cells specifically affects the heterochromatin nuclear subcompartment , or whether it might result in a more global loss of nuclear organization and architecture .
We used a specific antibody against the promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) protein to study the fate of the PML nuclear bodies , which are well-characterized subnuclear structures [ 22 ] .
We could not detect any significant difference in the <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> and aspect of PML nuclear bodies between control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells ( Figure 2D ) .
These data show that nuclear architecture is not globally altered following CAF-1 loss-of-function .
In addition , Western blot analysis revealed that CAF-1 depletion did not result in altered levels of chromatin architectural proteins such as histone H3 and HP1 ( Figure S1 ) .
Thus , CAF-1 is specifically required in early embryos and in ES cells for the proper organization of the heterochromatin subnuclear compartment .
Previous studies performed in mammalian cell lines showed that CAF-1 activity is required for <termsem="GO:0051320"> S phase </term> progression [ 16,23,24 ] .
We show here that 3 d after <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> of the <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> vector , p150CAF-1-depleted cells ( identified by a complete absence of CAF-1 IF signal ) appear still active for <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> , as revealed by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) ( Figure 3A ) , the PCNA ( <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> cell nuclear antigen ) pattern ( Figure 3B ) , and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 3C ) .
Hence , in these cells , <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> persists despite the drastic changes in heterochromatin organization .
However , 24 h later , ES cells cease to <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferate </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> , revealing that p150CAF-1 is required for an essential <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular process </term> , as in embryos .
Altogether , our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF-1 function in ES cells and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the nucleus and , in a subsequent step , <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> and viability .
In order to better characterize the defects in heterochromatin organization , we performed two-color DNA fluorescence in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> ( FISH ) experiments to reveal the spatial <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of pericentric and centric chromosomal regions , which in mouse are mainly composed of large blocks of major and minor satellite repeats , respectively [ 20 ] .
Pericentric domains from different chromosomes <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> clusters , which are revealed by FISH as large spots that coincide with DAPI-dense foci in the <termsem="GO:0051325"> interphase </term> nucleus ( Figure 4A ) .
At the periphery of each pericentric domain , centric regions <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> individual entities ( Figure 4A ) .
In p150CAF-1 <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> - depleted cells , we observed a disruption of pericentric heterochromatin clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI-dense foci ( Figure 4B ) .
Individual pericentric domains from single chromosomes are now found either isolated or aggregated in a pattern less dense than the regular clusters observed in control cells ( Figure 4B ) .
Such aggregates , which are often found at the nuclear periphery , are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF-1 loss-of-function .
Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the nucleus revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> signals in p150CAF-1-depleted cells ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , indicating <termsem="GO:0051312"> decondensation </term> of pericentric heterochromatin domains .
In contrast , centric domains showed an intensity and shape similar to control cells , suggesting that they remain unaffected by p150CAF-1 depletion ( Figure 4C and 4D ) .
In conclusion , these results show that p150CAF-1 is required for the proper <termsem="GO:0030261"> condensation </term> and clustering of pericentric heterochromatin domains .
Given the known role of CAF-1 in the deposition of histone H3 .1 and H4 associated with DNA <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> [ 11,12 ] , we wondered whether this defect in higher-order chromatin organization could reflect an aberrant nucleosomal organization .
Using <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> and micrococcal <termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> nuclease </term> </term> ( MNase ) assays , we could not observe any significant difference between control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells at the level of bulk genome chromatin or at pericentric repeats ( Figure 5 ) .
In a second series of experiments , we compared the association of histone H3 with chromatin in nuclei isolated from cells <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with control and p150CAF-1 <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> plasmid vectors .
Nuclei were incubated in buffers with different salt concentrations ranging from 100 mM NaCl to 1 M NaCl .
In all conditions , the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with chromatin was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells ( unpublished data ) .
Therefore , the loss of clustering and <termsem="GO:0051312"> decondensation </term> of pericentric heterochromatin are unlikely to be the consequence of severe defects in nucleosomal organization .
Our findings showed that the nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of HP1 is severely altered in Chaf1a  /  embryos and p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells .
We therefore examined the status of other epigenetic marks previously shown to characterize pericentric heterochromatin .
We first tested <termsem="GO:0010424"> DNA CpG methylation </term> [ 25 ] at major satellite repeats and found no significant difference between control and p150CAF-1-depleted cells ( Figure 6 ) .
As the LTM7 ES cell line that we used in our <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> experiments is a female ( XX ) cell line , <termsem="GO:0006306"> DNA methylation </term> is globally reduced in these cells [ 26 ] .
To rule out the possibility that hypomethylation of pericentric repeats might contribute to the destabilization of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells , we tested our <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> plasmid vector in a XY ES cell line , and confirmed that loss of p150CAF-1 leads to disruption of heterochromatin organization independently of the degree of <termsem="GO:0006306"> DNA methylation </term> at pericentric repeats ( unpublished data ) .
We next analyzed specific <termsem="GO:0016570"> histone modifications </term> [ 27 ] in chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments using native chromatin [ 28 ] .
We found that pericentric DNA was immunoprecipitated with a 2-fold lower efficiency with H4K20me3 [ 29,30 ] antibodies following p150CAF-1 depletion ( Figure 7A and 7B ) .
Immunoprecipitation of minor satellite repeats in the same experiment was less affected ( Figure 7B ) , showing that loss of p150CAF-1 function mainly affects H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin .
Moreover , no significant difference in immunoprecipitation efficiency was detected at intracisternal A particle ( IAP ) elements ( Figure 7B ) , which are noncentromeric repeated DNA elements also enriched in H4K20me3 [ 31 ] .
This result shows that p150CAF-1 contributes to normal levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric heterochromatin , but not necessarily at other loci .
The H3K9me3 mark [ 32 ] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF-1-depleted cells , though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B ) .
In wild-type cells , most of H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 signals are present at the level of DAPI-dense domains when visualized by IF [ 29 ] ( Figures 7C and 7D ) .
H3K9me3 was severely perturbed in p150CAF-1-depleted cells , displaying a diffuse pattern similar to HP1 ( Figure 7C ) .
The H4K20me3 pattern was even more severely altered , showing both a loss of the typical dots revealed in control cells and a reduction in signal intensity ( Figure 7D ) .
Consistent with our ChIP experiments , residual H4K20me3 epitopes were detected at the level of <termsem="GO:0051234"> relocated </term> DAPI-dense material .
Altogether , our results show that depletion of CAF-1 in ES cells leads to a simultaneous disruption of heterochromatin 3-D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking .
Here , we provide evidence that p150CAF-1 has a crucial function during mouse early <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> and in ES cells .
Previous studies showed that CAF-1 is essential for the progression of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> in vertebrates .
In Xenopus laevis , p150CAF-1 function is required for the rapid <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell divisions </term> that occur during early <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 33 ] .
Similarly , CAF-1 is essential in mammalian cell lines for the progression of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> [ 16,23,24,34 ] .
Our findings reveal a role for CAF-1 in the nuclear organization of heterochromatin domains during early <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and in ES cells .
We show that in p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells , while <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> initially persists without significant perturbation in nucleosomal organization , severe heterochromatin organization defects can be observed .
Loss of p150CAF-1 did not affect PML bodies in ES cell nuclei , showing that nuclear architecture is not generally altered .
Ultimately , p150CAF-1 depletion results in the <termsem="GO:0007050"> arrest </term> of ES <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> and <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> .
Given the major defects observed in heterochromatin organization , it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> arrest in the embryos and death in ES cells .
The role of CAF-1 in the nuclear organization of heterochromatin includes spatial <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> , <termsem="GO:0030261"> condensation </term> , and clustering of pericentric domains .
This important function of CAF-1 was not revealed in primary MEFs , 3T3 cells , or human cell lines , suggesting that it is specific of pluripotent embryonic cells .
Alternatively , early embryos and ES cells , whose genome is more plastic than somatic cells , might represent a particularly sensitive context in which the importance of CAF-1 in heterochromatin organization is exacerbated .
In ES cells , major architectural chromatin proteins are hyperdynamic and <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> relatively loosely to chromatin [ 35 ] .
In this cellular context , our findings show that proper heterochromatin nuclear architecture relies on CAF-1 function .
In contrast , in undifferentiated cells that are already <termsem="GO:0045165"> lineage committed </term> ( such as MEFs ) genome architecture might be more stable than in ES cells and thus can not be disrupted by CAF-1 depletion .
This important function of CAF-1 in pluripotent embryonic cells could be partially conserved during evolution .
Indeed , in Arabidopsis thaliana , in which CAF-1 is not essential for viability [ 36 ] , loss of CAF-1 is associated with a mild alteration in chromocenter size [ 37 ] .
This phenotype is somehow reminiscent of loss of CAF-1-mediated defects in heterochromatin organization in early mouse embryos .
In mouse ES cells , we show that CAF-1 is also required for regular levels of H4K20me3 at pericentric repeats , but not at IAP elements , which are repeated sequences spread all over the mouse genome .
These data suggest that proper nuclear organization and epigenetic marking of pericentric heterochromatin are coupled in ES cells .
Alternatively , 3-D organization of heterochromatin and epigenetic marking might represent two independent functions of CAF-1 .
The variable requirement for CAF-1 across species might reflect the acquisition of new properties affecting the function of histone H3 variants during evolution of eukaryotes .
CAF-1 is essential in mammals but dispensable in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 38 ] .
Interestingly , the <termsem="GO:0007114"> budding </term> yeast genome does not contain heterochromatin regions equivalent to those of higher eukaryotes , and several hallmark features of heterochromatin such as di - and <termsem="GO:0018023"> trimethylation </term> at H3K9 , H3K27 , and H4K20 are not observed in the silent chromatin of S. cerevisiae .
In mammals , H3K9 <termsem="GO:0018027"> dimethylation </term> is predominantly associated with H3 .1 , but not with H3 .3 , which carries modifications typically found in <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcribed </term> chromatin regions [ 39 ] .
Outside of the centromeric H3 variant , S. cerevisiae possesses only H3 .3 , which is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> and incorporated into chromatin in a <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> - independent fashion in higher eukaryotes [ 12 ] .
These data suggest a specific role for H3 .1 in heterochromatin regions .
We show here that CAF-1 , which is a H3 .1 <termsem="GO:0006260"> replication </term> - dependent loading complex [ 11 ] , is specifically required for the nuclear organization of pericentric heterochromatin in embryos and ES cells .
One possibility would be a scenario in which incorporation of H3 .1 into chromatin is required for the proper nuclear organization of constitutive heterochromatin in an embryonic context .
While this has to be addressed experimentally , it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of heterochromatin domains in p150CAF-1 null embryos and ES cells .
CAF-1 could be required for the loading , into heterochromatin , of an interacting partner required for the clustering of pericentric domains .
Following one or two rounds of <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> in the absence of p150CAF-1 , heterochromatin would become deprived of this molecule , which would cause the disruption of its 3-D organization .
A potential candidate is the HP1 protein , which interacts with CAF-1 [ 13,16 ] .
In agreement with a recent report [ 40 ] , our analysis of heterochromatin in pre - <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> embryos has revealed drastic changes in nuclear organization between the two-cell and blastocyst stages .
Cloning experiments in mouse revealed that the nuclear organization of heterochromatin in ES cell nuclei was quickly reverted into the one-cell stage-specific form after nuclear transfer [ 40 ] .
Hence , <termsem="GO:0006338"> remodeling </term> of heterochromatin 3-D organization parallels nuclear reprogramming toward an early embryonic status in cloned embryos .
This drastic reorganization of heterochromatin organization is similar to that observed in p150CAF-1-depleted ES cells , and in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmentally </term> arrested 16-cell stage Chaf1a  /  embryos .
These data show that CAF-1 is involved in setting up proper heterochromatin architecture during the first <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell divisions </term> of embryonic life .
Given the importance of nuclear organization in the <termsem="GO:0010468"> control of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> </term> [ 21,41 ] , this finding suggests that CAF-1 contributes to the coordinated programs of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> during early <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> .
Our findings open new perspectives in the understanding of chromatin dynamics during early <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and in pluripotent embryonic cells .
While most studies focused on the role of <termsem="GO:0006306"> DNA methylation </term> and <termsem="GO:0016570"> histone modifying </term> enzymes [ 3 ] , our data point to the importance of the <termsem="GO:0031497"> chromatin assembly </term> machinery .
We show that in addition to <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembling </term> nucleosomes , CAF-1 provides spatial and epigenetic information to heterochromatin domains in early embryos and ES cells .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> <termsem="GO:0032502"> Generation </term> </term> of Chaf1a mutant mice and embryos .
Using PCR , we amplified two genomic fragments ( about 3 kb each ) flanking Chaf1a exon 3 .
These DNA fragments were <termsem="GO:0009058"> assembled </term> by conventional cloning with the neomycin and DT ( diphtheria toxin ) cassettes , as described in Figure 1A .
The construct was <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> in ES cells by electroporation .
We identified <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> ES cells carrying the mutant Chaf1atm1Ger ( abbreviated Chaf1a  in the manuscript ) allele by Southern blot ( Figure 1A ) .
We derived Chaf1a + /  mice by injecting <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> ES cells into C57BL/6N blastocysts .
E4 embryos obtained from the intercross of Chaf1a + /  mice were genotyped by nested-PCR amplification .
Embryos were collected in a PCR reaction mix containing oligonucleotide primers 1 , 2 , and 3 ( Figure 1A ) that amplify the wild-type and mutant alleles .
After 30 cycles of amplification , 1 l of each PCR reaction was used in a second round of PCR amplification with a new set of oligonucleotide primers .
After 30 cycles of amplification , PCR reactions were run onto an agarose gel , which revealed the presence of the wild-type ( 150 bp ) and <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> ( 200 bp ) alleles .
P150CAF-1 depletion by <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> .
The <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> plasmid vector that we used in this study contains the mouse H1 promoter and a puromycin selection gene ( SB and MG , unpublished data ) .
We characterized in detail the properties of this new vector using a GFP target gene and FACS : Extinction of target genes in ES cells is highly efficient in 70 % of the cells , of intermediate efficiency in 15 % , and inefficient in the remaining 15 % of cells analysis .
The sequence of p150CAF-1 siRNA ( short <termsem="GO:0016246"> interfering </term> RNA ) duplex [ 16 ] was cloned into this plasmid .
The control vector <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> a siRNA that targets GFP <termsem="GO:0006401"> RNA degradation </term> .
ES cells were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> by electroporation with the RNA plasmid vector , seeded onto gelatin-coated slides , and cultured for 24 h in the absence of selection .
Puromycin ( 2 g/ml ) was added to the culture medium and cells were cultured for an additional 48-h period .
Using the p150CAF-1 <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> vector , IF microscopy quantification reveals a complete CAF-1 depletion in most cells ( Figure S1B ) .
Western blot analysis ( Figure S1A ) reveals residual p150CAF-1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , as expected from the 15 % of cells that do not inhibit the target gene .
MEFs ( passage 3 , 90 % confluence ) were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> during 4 h with the <termsem="GO:0016246"> RNAi </term> plasmid vector using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogene , Carlsbad , California , United States ) according to manufacturer 's conditions .

Nuclei were purified by centrifugation ( 10,000  g for 30 min , at 4 C ) on sucrose cushions ( buffer 1 with 1.2 M sucrose ) and resuspended in <termsem="GO:0004518"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> nuclease </term> </term> buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 20 mM NaCl , 0.32 M sucrose , 4 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM CaCl2 ) .
About 2.106 nuclei were incubated with increasing quantities of MNase ( 0.04 -- 1.6 units ) or <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> ( 0.25 -- 16 units ) .
<termsem="GO:0009056"> Digestion </term> time at 37 C was 10 min for MNase and 2 min for <termsem="GO:0004530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase I </term> </term> .
<termsem="GO:0009056"> Digestions </term> were stopped by adding SDS to 1 % and EDTA to 50 mM .
