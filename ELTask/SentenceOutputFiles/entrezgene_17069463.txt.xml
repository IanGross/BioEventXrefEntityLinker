<termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> Modulates Cox11 and Hexokinase I Activities and Haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> Causes Deficits in Glucose Metabolism .
The Ran-binding protein 2 ( RanBP2 ) is a large multimodular and pleiotropic protein .
Several molecular partners with distinct functions interacting specifically with selective modules of RanBP2 have been identified .
Yet , the significance of these interactions with RanBP2 and the genetic and physiological role ( s ) of RanBP2 in a whole-animal model remain elusive .
Here , we report the identification of two novel partners of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and a novel physiological role of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> in a mouse model .
<termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> associates in vitro and in vivo and colocalizes with the mitochondrial metallochaperone , <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , and the pacemaker of glycolysis , <termsem="EG:15275"> hexokinase type I </term> ( <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> ) via its leucine-rich domain .
The leucine-rich domain of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> also exhibits strong chaperone activity toward intermediate and mature folding species of Cox11 supporting a chaperone role of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> in the cytosol during <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> biogenesis .
<termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> partially colocalizes with <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , thus supporting additional and distinct roles in cell function .
Cox11 is a strong inhibitor of HKI , and <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> suppresses the inhibitory activity of Cox11 over HKI .
To probe the physiological role of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and its role in <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> function , a mouse model harboring a genetically disrupted <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> locus was generated .
<termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term>  /  are embryonically lethal , and haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> in an inbred strain causes a pronounced decrease of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system .
Inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice also exhibit deficits in growth rates and glucose catabolism without impairment of glucose uptake and gluconeogenesis .
These phenotypes are accompanied by a decrease in the electrophysiological responses of photosensory and postreceptoral neurons .
Hence , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and its partners emerge as critical modulators of neuronal <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , glucose catabolism , energy homeostasis , and targets for metabolic , aging disorders and allied neuropathies .
The Ran-binding protein 2 ( RanBP2 ) is a large protein with several domains .
Although several protein partners were found to interact with selective domains of RanBP2 , none to this date were found toward its large leucine-rich domain ( LD ) .
Cell-based experiments support several roles of RanBP2 in cell function , such as the production of functional proteins , control of protein trafficking between the nuclear and cytosol compartments , and control of multiple facets underlying cell division .
Still , the genetic and physiological implications of the interactions between RanBP2 and its partners and of the function of RanBP2 in a whole-animal model remain elusive .
The authors report the identification of two novel mitochondrial partners of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> , Cox11 and hexokinase type I ( HKI ) ; and with multidisciplinary approaches probe the role of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> and its LD on <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> , <termsem="EG:281771"> HKI </term> , and functions allied to these .
The authors found that <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> exhibits chaperone activity toward HKI and Cox11 .
<termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and Cox11 profoundly modulate HKI activity .
Moreover , partial loss-of-function of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> in a mouse model induces deficits in growth rates and breakdown of glucose , promotes the down-regulation of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system , and impairs visual function .
These findings support a critical role of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> and its partners in metabolic processes and allied disease states .
The RanBP2/Nup358 is a unique vertebrate and large scaffold protein comprised of multiple structural and functional domains [ 1 -- 4 ] .
Several roles of RanBP2 have emerged that implicate RanBP2 in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking [ 3,5 ] , protein biogenesis [ 6,7 ] , the formation of the mitotic spindle , assembly of the nuclear envelope [ 8 ] , and the integration of the nuclear envelope breakdown with kinetochore formation and maturation during early mitotic progression [ 9 ] .
The specific interaction of RanBP2 with a diverse set of partners likely reflects a pleiotropic role of RanBP2 in cell function , possibly through the integration of multiple pathways .
On the other hand , the cell ( tissue ) - selective interaction of RanBP2 with some of its partners may also impart cell-restricted roles to RanBP2 .
For example , the Ran-binding domains RBDn = 1-4 of RanBP2 associate with the nuclear import co-receptor , importin- [ 10,11 ] , and antibodies against RanBP2 inhibit the nuclear import pathway in HeLa cells [ 3 ] ; but such a role seems dispensable in Xenopus oocytes [ 12 ] .
In addition , the combination of the C-terminal domains , RBD4 and CY ( of RanBP2 ) , associates with a subset of G protein-coupled receptors , the red/green opsin , expressed in photosensory neurons and enhances opsin functional production [ 6,7 ] , while the interaction of the KBD of RanBP2 with a subset of the conventional microtubule-based motor proteins , the kinesins , KIF5B and KIF5C , occurs selectively in the central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 13 ] .
A diverse set of additional molecular partners , each associating specifically with a selective domain of RanBP2 , are likely to impart and integrate additional roles to RanBP2 .
For example , the cyclophilin-like domain ( CLD ) , the internal repeat ( W1W2/IR ) , and zinc-finger rich ( ZnF ) domains of RanBP2 associate specifically with components of the 19S cap of the proteasome [ 14 ] , the E2 SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme ( Ubc9 ) [ 15 ] , and the nuclear export receptor , CRM1/exportin -1 [ 16 ] , respectively .
RanBP2 itself was also found to exhibit SUMO1 E3 ligase activity [ 17 ] , supporting a direct link between RanBP2-mediated SUMO-1 substrate modification and relocation of SUMO-1 modified cytosolic substrates ( e.g. , RanGAP ) to the cytosolic face of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) [ 18 ] .
Finally , RanBP2 was also found to localize prominently to the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid subcellular compartment of photosensory neurons [ 19 ] and to RanGTPase-restricted foci along cytoplasmic tracks [ 19 ] , in addition to its localization at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from nuclear pores [ 2,3,10,12,19 ] .
Emerging evidence supports that the CNS-selective effects of RanBP2 may also underlie the pathogenesis of certain neuropathies .
Parkin is ubiquitously expressed and interacts with the Ubc9-interacting domain of RanBP2 [ 20 ] .
This promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of RanBP2 [ 20 ] , possibly via the interaction of the CLD domain of RanBP2 with the 19S cap subunits of the proteasome [ 14 ] .
Interestingly , the small <termsem="EG:851565"> <termsem="EG:851000"> yeast Ran </term> - binding protein 1 </term> ( RanBP1 ) , <termsem="EG:851565"> Yrb1p </term> , with strong homology to the Ran-binding domains of RanBP2 , is also required for cell-cycle regulated protein degradation [ 21 ] .
Parkin , like RanBP2 [ 17 ] , has E3-ligase activity [ 22 -- 24 ] ; and loss-of-function of <termsem="EG:5071"> parkin </term> leads to early onset autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism [ 25 ] .
While the dopaminergic neuronal-restricted effects of mutations in parkin are not understood [ 25 ] , <termsem="EG:50873"> parkin </term>  /  mice exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and energy and growth deficits , and a fraction of parkin localizes to the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondria , where together with other partners is thought to promote the degradation of selective mitochondrial substrates and to exert a neuroprotective function [ 26 -- 29 ] .
These data suggest that deficits in RanBP2 and parkin may share ( patho ) physiological pathways and support a multifaceted role of RanBP2 .
Yet clear functions of RanBP2 in animal and cell physiology remain elusive .
Here , we report on the identification and function of two novel partners of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> , <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> and <termsem="EG:281771"> hexokinase type I </term> ( <termsem="EG:281771"> HKI </term> ) , which interact with a large and orphan domain of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> , the leucine-rich domain ( LD ) ; and on the outcome of partial loss-of-function of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> on <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , animal physiology , and glucose/energy metabolism .
The LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> Interacts with Cox11 and HKI .
The LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> ( Figure 1A ) is a large and orphan domain of ~ 700 residues ( ~ 80 kDa ) , for which no molecular partners have been identified until this date .
Brain and retina yeast two-hybrid libraries were screened with LD .
Cox11 was identified as a partner to this domain ( Figure 1B and 1C ) .
Cox11 is a metallochaperone implicated in cytochrome c oxidase assembly [ 30,31 ] .
Structure-function analysis of the interaction between mCox11 , LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> , and subdomains thereof , with quantitative yeast two-hybrid assays [ 32 ] , showed optimal interaction between the intact LD and Cox11 proteins ( Figure 1C ) .
Pull-down assays of retinal extracts with glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) - LD precipitates a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant dimer isoform of Cox11 ( Figure 1D , top panel ) , which does not bind to GST-LDZIP alone .
In addition to Cox11 , we also found that other mitochondrial components such as the outer membrane-associated protein , HKI [ 33 ] ( Figure 1D , bottom panel ) and mHsp70 ( unpublished data ) , associated with LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> .
This association was highly specific toward the HKI isoform , because HKII , HKIII , and glucokinase did not interact with the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> ( unpublished data ) .
The interaction of Cox11 , HKI , and mHsp70 with RanBP2 occurred in vivo in retinal extracts , since antibodies against these and RanBP2 coimmunoprecipitated RanBP2 ( Figure 1E ) and HKI ( Figure 1F ) , respectively , and these interactions were observed across different tissues ( Figure S1 ) .
Since RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity , we assessed whether the interaction between the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and Cox11 was direct and the chaperone activity of LD toward folding species of Cox11 .
Reconstitution binding assays were carried out between purified LD and Cox11 , fully and partially denatured with GnHCl and urea , respectively , and native Cox11 ( Figure 1G and 1H ) .
Partial denatured Cox11 exhibits significantly higher and concentration-dependent binding affinity toward LD compared with the native and fully denatured Cox11 ( Figure 1G ) .
In addition , native Cox11 purified upon expression in the presence of CuSO4 ( a prosthetic group tightly bound to Cox11 ) [ 31 ] , shows significantly higher binding activity toward the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> , than in the absence of CuSO4 ( Figure 1H ) .

( C ) Structure-function analysis of the interaction between the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and Cox11 .
Optimal interaction between the LD and Cox11 occurred in the presence of constructs comprising both the complete LD and Cox11 .
Although removal of the cytosolic N-terminal ( Cox11-C ) significantly decreased the interaction with LD , the mitochondrial intermembrane domain of Cox11 ( Cox11-C ) together with the C-terminal half of LD ( LD-C ) retained most of the interaction activity .
LD-N and LD-C ended and began with the leucine zipper domain of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> .

Cox 11 Inhibits HKI Activity and the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> Reverses the Inhibition of Cox11 over HKI .
To probe whether the interaction of Cox11 and HKI with the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> modulates the enzymatic activity of HKI , we first examined the effect of increasing concentrations of Cox11 on the initial rates of HKI enzymatic activity ( Figure 2A ) .
Cox11 strongly inhibits HKI activity in a concentration-dependent fashion , and at ~ 15 nM of Cox11 , HKI activity could not be recorded ( Figure 2A ) .
Cox11 behaves as a partial noncompetitive inhibitor of HKI by affecting the Vmax of HKI for glucose ( Figure 2B ) .
Then , we evaluated the effect of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> on the HK activity in the presence of a fixed inhibitory concentration of Cox11 , saturating concentration of glucose substrate , and increasing concentrations of LD .
As shown in Figure 2C , the LD domain sharply reversed the inhibitory effect of Cox11 on HKI activity in a concentration-dependent manner , but under saturating ( and stochiometric ) amounts of LD , the velocity of the reaction did not reach that observed for HKI activity in the absence of Cox11 ( Figure 2A ) , suggesting the LD by itself may also have an effect on HKI activity .
Indeed , a saturating concentration of LD reduced the Vmax but not the Km of HKI ( Figure 2D ) by ~ 20 % under similar conditions .

Cox11 behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of HKI by reducing the Vmax of HKI but not its Km toward glucose .
( C ) HKI rate is plotted as a function of LD concentration at saturating glucose and fixed Cox11 ( 7.5 nM ) concentrations .
Note that increasing concentrations of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> reverse the inhibition of HKI activity by Cox11 .
A half-maximal effect of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> on HKI activity in the presence of 7.5 nM of Cox11 was observed at a concentration of ~ 0.05 nM of LD .
( D ) Rate versus glucose plot in the absence and presence of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> .
At a saturating concentration of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> ( 3.75 nM ) , the HKI activity was reduced by about 20 % .

<termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> Colocalizes with <termsem="EG:281771"> HK1 </term> , <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , and <termsem="EG:517535"> mHsp70 </term> in the Retina and Cultured Neurons .
In addition to its presence at the vicinity of NPCs , we have shown previously that RanBP2 is localized to and abundant in the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid subcellular compartment of photosensory ( photoreceptor ) neurons of the retina [ 19 ] .
We extended the subcellular colocalization studies on <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> and its novel partners by immunocytochemistry to determine if <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> , <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> , <termsem="EG:281771"> HKI </term> , and <termsem="EG:517535"> mHsp70 </term> colocalize in hippocampal neurons ( Figure 3A -- 3C ) , cerebral cortex neurons ( Figure 3D -- 3F ) , ellipsoid ( mitochondria-rich ) subcellular compartments of photosensory neurons of the retina ( Figure 3G -- 3O ) , and dissociated primary glia and neuron cultures from the brain ( Figure 3P -- 3Z ) .
Double immunostaining with antibodies against these proteins showed that they colocalize to the mitochondria ( Figure 3A -- 3Z ) .
Localization of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> and Its LD Molecular Partners .
( A -- F ) are thin cryosections of an area of the hipocampus ( CA1 neurons ) and cerebral cortex , respectively , immunostained against <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> ( A and D ) , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> ( B and E ) , and merged images thereof ( C and F ) .
Note that while <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> are widely expressed among and colocalize to hippocampal neurons ( C ) , <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> expression and localization with <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> is restricted to a subset of cortical neurons ( likely interneurons ) ( F ) .
Images of the distal region of bovine retinal cryosections comprising part of the nuclear layer of photoreceptor neurons and their inner ( myoid and ellipsoid ) segment compartment ( G -- O ) are immunostained against <termsem="EG:517535"> mHsp70 </term> ( G ) and <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> ( H ) , <termsem="EG:517535"> mHsp70 </term> ( J ) and <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> ( K ) , <termsem="EG:281771"> HKI </term> ( M ) and <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> ( N ) , and merged images thereof ( I -- O ) .
Note the prominent localization of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> , <termsem="EG:517535"> mHsp70 </term> , and <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> at the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid compartment of photoreceptors and the colocalization of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> and <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> with <termsem="EG:517535"> mHsp70 </term> ( I and L ) , while <termsem="EG:281771"> HKI </term> colocalization with <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> was limited to restricted foci ( R , arrowheads ) .
High-resolution images of dissociated primary cerebral neurons and glial cells confirmed that the colocalization of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> and <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> was highly restricted ( P -- R ) , while <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> extensively colocalized with <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> ( S -- U ) and <termsem="EG:15526"> mHsp70 </term> ( V -- Z ) .

Haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> Causes Decreased Levels of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> and Partial Mislocalization of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> .
To determine the physiological implications of the interaction between <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> ( and other partners ) , we employed a murine embryonic stem 129Ola cell line with a targeted <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> locus produced by gene-trapping to produce stable inbred ( coisogenic ) and mixed background lines , respectively ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Genotyping of 299 F2 offspring revealed a <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + : <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  : <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term>  /  distribution ( 89:210:0 ) that deviated from the expected Mendelian ratio and supports that the <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term>  /  mice were embryonically lethal .
E12 .5 embryos show strong expression of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> in the optic vesicle and throughout much of the embryo , which had no apparent developmental abnormalities ( Figure 4C ) .
In agreement with previous immunocytochemistry analysis [ 19 ] , the <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> gene is expressed across mature retinal neurons , but expression in ganglion cells of the adult retina was extremely strong ( Figure 4D and 4E ) .
Insertion Mutagenesis of the Murine <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> Gene .
( A ) Diagram of the genomic region of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> disrupted by insertion trap mutagenesis with a bicistronic reporter vector between exon 1 and 2 .
The bicistronic transcript produces two proteins under regulation of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> .
Upon splicing of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> , a fusion between exon 1 and -geo ( a fusion between the -gal and neo genes ) is generated , while <termsem="EG:250"> human placental alkaline phophatase </term> ( PLAP ) is independently translated using the internal ribosome entry site .
Consistent with previous studies , the expression of the former is directed to cell bodies , while expression of the latter is targeted to the axonal processes [ 67,68 ] .
Transcriptional 5  RACE analysis detects a fusion between exon 1 and -geo .

Although <termsem="EG:250"> PLAP </term> was broadly expressed ( e.g. , somites , limbs , and CNS ) , the <termsem="EG:250"> PLAP </term> and -Gal ( inset picture ) expression was particularly high in the optic vesicle ( arrow ) .

Consistent with previous immunocytochemistry studies , -Gal activity is detected in the neuroretinal bodies and inner segment compartment of photoreceptors with conspicuously strong expression in ganglion cells .
<termsem="EG:250"> PLAP </term> expression is found throughout the plexiform/synaptic layers and outer segment of photoreceptors ( E ) .

In light of the association in vivo of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> with <termsem="EG:510509"> Cox11 </term> and <termsem="EG:281771"> HKI </term> ( Figures 1 and 3 ) , profound in vitro modulation of HKI enzymatic activity by <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and Cox11 ( Figure 2 ) , and the critical role of HKI in catalyzing a rate-limiting step of glycolysis , we probed whether <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice presented disturbances in <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , and energy homeostasis .
Monoallelic expression of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> does not affect the number of NPCs and their distribution in hippocampal neurons ( Figure 5A , unpublished data ) , but it led to consistent lower expression of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> by more than 50 % in the CNS ( brain and retina ) in 129Ola ( Figure 5B -- 5D ) , but not in C57BL/6J/129Ola backgrounds ( unpublished data ) .
Hence , we focused our analysis on the inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  129Ola mouse line .
Although the levels of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> were decreased in the retina , brain , and hippocampus of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice by ~ 50 % -- 60 % ( Figure 5B and 5C ) , the levels of others nucleoporins , <termsem="EG:218210"> Nup153 </term> and <termsem="EG:18226"> Nup62 </term> , and <termsem="EG:15526"> mHsp70 </term> and <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , remained unchanged ( Figure 5B , unpublished data ) .
In addition , we observed a strong decrease of the levels of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> ( 3 - to 4-fold ) ( Figure 5B and 5C ) .
This decrease was selective to the CNS , since <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> levels remained largely unaffected in the skeletal muscle , spleen , and liver ( Figure 5D ) .
Because HKI plays a key role in the production of energy intermediate substrates and HKI is virtually the sole HK isoform expressed in the CNS [ 33,34 ] , we probed the impact of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> reduction in the levels of ATP .
As shown in Figure 5E , there was significant and concordant reduction in levels of ATP in the CNS ( brain and retina ) , but not in non-neuronal tissues .
Finally , we also observed partial and selective delocalization of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , but not of <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , from the ellipsoid ( mitochondria-rich ) to the adjacent myoid subcellular compartment of rod photosensory neurons ( Figure S2A -- S2E ) .
This was also accompanied by reduced <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> levels in the inner retina , in particular in the inner plexiform ( synaptic ) layer ( Figure S2A -- S2E ) .
Haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> Causes a Decrease in <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> Protein and ATP Levels .
( A ) Quantitative analysis of NPCs in dissociated hippocampal neurons of wild-type ( + / + ) and heterozygote ( + /  ) mice upon immunostaining with mAb414 .
No difference in the density of NPCs ( 3 -- 4 NPC/m2 ) at the nuclear envelope was found between <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice .
( B ) Immunoblots with anti-RanBP2 / Nup153/Nup62 ( mAb414 ) ,  HKI ,  mHsp70 , and  <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> antibodies of retinal ( top panel ) and hippocampal homogenates of + / + and + /  mice .
In comparison to <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice exhibit a reduction in the expression levels of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> but not of other proteins .
( C ) Quantitative analysis of relative protein expression levels of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> , <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , and <termsem="EG:15526"> mHsp70 </term> in the hippocampus of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice .
There is ~ 2 - and 4-fold reduction of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> in heterozygote mice .
( D ) The level of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> is reduced in the brain but not in other non-neuronal tissues tested ( muscle , spleen , and liver ) .
( E ) The total ATP level is reduced in the CNS tissues ( brain and retina ) but not in non-neuronal tissues tested ( e.g. , spleen ) .
Metabolic Disturbances Caused by Haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> .
The growth rates of inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice on high-fat ( ~ 10 % fat ) diet were significantly slower than <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + mice ( Figure 6A ) .
Beginning at around 4 mo of age , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice exhibit a significant slower gain in body mass than wild-type mice ( Figure 6A ) .
In addition , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  inbred mice presented deficits in body mass that were erased by changing the genetic background to a mixed C57BL/6J/129Ola ( Figure 6B ) .
Food consumption did not account for the body weight differences observed ( Figure 6C ) .
<termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  Mice on High-Fat Diet Exhibit Deficits in Growth .
( A ) In comparison to wild-type mice , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice show slower growth rates beginning at 4 mo of age ( arrow ) , and the difference in body weight between these is maintained afterward .
Note that <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice lack the growth spur observed in wild-type mice between 3 and 4 mo of age .
( B ) In comparison to inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( 129Ola genetic background ) , the difference in body weight between <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice is masked upon placing these on a mixed 129Ola/C57Bl6 genetic background .
( C ) <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  inbred mice exhibit similar rates of food consumption .
Mice in ( A ) , ( B ) , and ( C ) were placed on a high-fat diet since birth ( n = 5 ) .
HKI in the CNS ( brain and retina ) accounts virtually for all expression of HK isozymes and glucose utilization in the CNS [ 33,34 ] .
Moreover , glucose is the sole reliance source of energy in the CNS under normal conditions , the CNS lacks glucose storage sources , and despite the disproportionate mass of the CNS to the rest of the body , the CNS consumes daily about 60 % of the body 's glucose and 25 % of the total oxygen [ 35,36 ] .
To determine the impact of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> haploinsufficiency on the utilization , formation , and uptake of glucose , we carried out several physiological assays .
In contrast to mice placed on a normal chow diet ( ~ 5 % fat ; unpublished data ) , <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice on a higher fat diet ( ~ 10 % fat ) performed significantly worse in the glucose tolerance test beginning at 6 mo of age ( Figure 7A and 7B ) , thus supporting that the <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice exhibited a deficit in glucose clearance .
This deficit was rescued in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice of mixed C57BL/6J/129Ola background ( Figure S3 ) .
Glucose clearance was not affected due to a disturbance in <termsem="EG:16334"> insulin </term> - mediated glucose uptake ( Figure 7C ) .
Then , we probed whether <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> induces impairment of gluconeogenesis , which could contribute to the pathophysiological production and clearance of glucose .
To this end , the administration of the gluconeogenic substrate precursor , pyruvate ( pyruvate tolerance test ) , showed that there was no difference in glucose production in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( Figure 7D ) .
Hence , partial loss-of-function of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> had no impact on the gluconeogenesis pathway .
However , upon glucose production ( 15 min ) , the clearance rates of glucose were again significantly slower in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  than in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + mice ( Figure 7D ) , confirming an impairment in glucose breakdown .
Metabolic Phenotypes of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  Inbred Mice on High-Fat Diet .
( A ) 3-mo-old inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( n = 5 ) have normal glucose clearance rates upon glucose challenge and overnight fasting .
( B ) In contrast , 6-mo-old inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( n = 5 ) have significantly decreased glucose clearance rates upon glucose challenge and overnight fasting .
( C ) Fasted 6 - to 8-mo-old <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice have no difference in <termsem="EG:16334"> insulin </term> - mediated glucose uptake as assayed by <termsem="EG:3630"> insulin </term> tolerance test ( n = 5 ) .
( D ) Pyruvate tolerance test shows normal rise in glucose but decreased glucose clearance between inbred <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( n = 5 ) .
Haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> Causes Deficits in the Electrophysiological Output of Receptoral and Postreceptoral Retinal Neurons .
In light of the prominent expression of RanBP2 and HKI in retinal neurons [ 1,19 ] , the vital dependence of the neuronal retina ( and brain ) on glucose as the main substrate source for energy production , and the determinant impact of metabolic disorders , such as diabetes , in retinal function ( e.g. , diabetic retinopathy ) [ 37 ] , we probed the impact of deficits in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> , <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , and ATP , on the electrophysiological responses of subclasses ( rod and cone ) photoreceptor and postreceptor retinal neurons of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  and in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + mice .
The scotopic ( dark-adapted ) responses mediated by the rod photoreceptor pathway at low-stimulus intensities and mixed rod and cone pathways at high-stimulus intensities were substantially reduced in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( Figure 8A ) .
The differences in the photopic ( light-adapted ) responses , initiated by cone photoreceptors , which make up 3 % of the photosensory neurons in the mouse retina [ 38 ] , were less obvious but still exhibited a trend toward reduced amplitudes across a range of increasing light stimulus intensities ( Figure 8B ) .
The reduction in the scotopic responses included decreases in both b-wave ( Figure 8C ) and a-wave ( Figure 8D ) amplitudes mediated by postreceptoral and receptoral neurons , respectively .
Postreceptoral second-order neuron responses , represented by the b-wave , tended to be more consistently and substantially reduced than the a-waves , which directly reflect photoreceptor activity .
Since second-order neuron responses depend on input from photoreceptors , this suggests that reduced b-wave amplitudes are the result of the accumulation of decreases in the light response of both photoreceptors and postreceptoral neurons .
Anesthetics , particularly ketamine , can cause sustained elevation of glucose in mice , which in turn affects electroretinogram responses [ 39 ] .
Thus , we were concerned that differences in electroretinogram amplitudes between <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + may reflect differences in glucose level changes in response to anesthesia .
However , we found no significant differences in glucose levels measured before and every 15 min during 75 min of anesthesia ( n = 4 -- 5 ) .
Glucose rose at the same rate and reached a maximum of approximately 3.3 times the pre-anesthesia level in both genotypes ( unpublished data ) .
Electroretinograms from 6-Mo-Old <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + Inbred Mice Showing Photoreceptor and Postreceptor Neuron Electrophysiological Response Phenotypes .
( A ) Scotopic ( dark-adapted ) responses from <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice to light stimuli of increasing intensity , beginning at threshold , have reduced amplitudes compared to those observed in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + mice .
The three lower intensities represent responses generated in the rod photoreceptor neuronal pathway .
The upper intensities are comprised of responses generated in both the rod and cone pathways .
( B ) Photopic ( light-adapted , cone photoreceptor pathway ) responses of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice to increasing light stimulus intensities also exhibited reduced amplitudes compared to those observed in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + mice .
( C ) Average  SE ( n = 9 ) scotopic b-wave amplitudes from <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  ( open circles ) and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + ( filled squares ) mice representing postreceptoral neuron function .
( Note : log amplitude scale . )
( D ) Average  SE ( n = 5 ) scotopic a-wave amplitudes , representing photoreceptor function , for <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + mice in response to bright flashes .
Amplitudes of responses from <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice were lower over the entire range of stimulus intensities for both b - and a-waves .
Asterisks represent significant differences between the groups ( Student 's t test , p < 0.05 ) .
Statistical significance was found across all intensities for b-wave amplitudes ( 2-way ANOVA , p < 0.0001 ) , but not for the a-wave .
Our findings support that <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> plays a determinant role in modulating glucose and energy homeostasis .
The data support that Cox1 and HKI are novel partners in vivo for the large LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
The LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> exhibits chaperone activity toward folding intermediates of Cox11 , and possibly , the mature HKI ( Figure 1 ) .
Cox11 inhibits noncompetitively the activity of HKI with ~ 2 -- 3 molecules of Cox11 ( assuming formation of Cox11 dimer ) required to inhibit completely the activity of a molecule of HKI ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Cox11 sequesters HKI by binding to HKI at a site that is distinct from the active site and effectively reduces the availability of [ HKI ] tot for catalysis .
This is reflected by a reduction of the Vmax of HKI without significantly affecting the Km of the active site of HKI toward glucose ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
The inhibitory property of Cox11 over HKI is suppressed by <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> ( Figure 2C ) , which by itself has a weak but significant inhibitory activity over HKI ( Figure 2D ) .
The sub-stochiometry effect of the LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> over the inhibition of HKI by Cox11 supports that a LD-dependent chaperonin-like mechanism underlies the suppression of Cox11-dependent inhibition of HKI by <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> , and that <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> acts as a molecular `` buffer '' over HK1 and Cox11 activities .
The partial loss of the <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> chaperone activity in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice also leads to deficits in the sequestration of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> in the ellipsoid compartment of photosensory neurons .
This possibly underlies the mistargeting of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> to the myoid compartment of these neurons ( Figure S2 ) .
The data support that the ultimate pathophysiological outcome in <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> , caused by a reduction in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> levels and its chaperone activity , is the selective degradation of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> as reflected by the reduced levels of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> ( and ATP ) but not of other mitochondrial and NPC components ( Figure 5 ) .
Through this process , it is also possible that deficits in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> cause a disturbance in the equilibrium between <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> , <termsem="EG:15275"> HK1 </term> , and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> by leading to an increase of the inhibitory activity of <termsem="EG:69802"> Cox11 </term> over <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> that promotes the uncoupling of the interaction of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> from <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> , ultimately causing <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> degradation .
Regardless , lower levels of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> likely contribute to the decreased levels in ATP , slower growth rates , and diminished ability to metabolize glucose of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice ( Figures 5 -- 7 ) .
As discussed subsequently , the ATP deficits in the retina likely account for the reduced electrophysiological responses of retinal neurons ( Figure 8 ) .
Various domains of RanBP2 have been previously implicated with a chaperone role in the cell .
These include the enhancement of the biogenesis of red/green opsin by the combination of the RBD4-CY domains [ 6,7 ] and the stabilization by the Ran-binding domains of RanBP2 of the guanosine triphosphate-bound conformational state of RanGTPase and interaction of Ran with importin- [ 11,40,41 ] .
The data herein show that the multi-chaperone role of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> extends also to its LD in light of its ability to associate to distinct folding species of Cox11 and to prevent HKI from being degraded .
This chaperone function is likely to be complemented by other partners of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> with similar and pleiotropic functions .
For example , the combination of the CLD of RanBP2 with several subunits of the 19S cap of the proteasome [ 14 ] , and of its neighboring internal repeat , W1W2/IR with the E3-ubiquitin ligase , parkin [ 20 ] , and the E2 SUMO-1-conjugating protein , Ubc9 [ 15 ] may contribute to the down-regulation of HKI by 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis and modulation of the molecular and subcellular partitioning of these partners .
In this regard , it will be interesting to probe whether parkin also causes deficits in HKI in dopaminergic neurons , since parkin was reported to modulate RanBP2 turnover [ 20 ] , and parkin loss-of-function also causes energy and growth deficits [ 26 -- 29,42 ] .
These data add a new dimension to the complexity of the regulation of the glycolytic pathway , in particular in the CNS , where glycolysis plays a major role in supplying energy and where the proteasome machinery may play a critical role in modulating components of the energy supply machinery [ 43 ] .
This is further evidenced by the presence of genetic modifiers in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice on a mixed genetic background that compensates for deficits in <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and deregulation of its partners in glucose/energy homeostasis as observed in the coisogenic line .
The presence of such compensatory mechanisms is also supported by the identification of a quantitative trait locus , which encompasses RanBP2 , and modifies the expression of diabetes-related phenotypes [ 44 ] .
The data herein show tissues with a decrease of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> and <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> levels mirror a reduction in the ATP levels .
Since the constitutive Na + / K + ATPase pump and the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamine to glutamate ( both fundamental to maintain the electrical activity in the CNS ) consumes the vast majority of the energy produced by the CNS [ 45 -- 47 ] , this likely underlies the suppression of the electrophysiological output responses of retinal neurons ( Figure 8 ) .
Moreover , deficits in HKI may lead to intracellular hyperglycemia in the CNS , promote sorbitol-induced osmotic stress , and compromise further the ATPase-dependent Na + / K + pump activity [ 48 -- 50 ] .
This may be exacerbated by a decrease of ATP , since the activity of HKI is also stimulated by ATP [ 51 ] .
The cumulative effects of a reduction in ATP and intracellular hyperglycemia are known to act synergistically and modulate the electrophysiological properties of neuronal activity .
Figure 9 integrates in a model these variables and implications of the data presented herein .
Still , other bona fide RanBP2 partners previously identified and described in the Introduction also become strong candidates to play a role in energy homeostasis .
For example , the unfolding and chaperone activity of components of the 19S cap of the proteasome may be modulated by the CLD of RanBP2 [ 14 ] and contribute to the selective HKI ( and other substrates ) degradation [ 43 ] , while association of nuclear import receptor , importin- with the Ran-binding domains of RanBP2 [ 10,11 ] , may mediate the nuclear translocation of multifunctional substrates , such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase .
This trafficking process is selectively inhibited by the neuroprotective drug , R - ( - ) - deprenyl and derivates thereof , and are often employed to treat Parkinson disease [ 52 -- 57 ] .
Hence , <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and its partners emerge as key players and target genes in mediating neuropathophysiological mechanisms implicated in various genetic and environmental lesions to the CNS , as in patients with Parkinson , diabetes with <termsem="EG:3630"> insulin </term> - resistance , and other neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases , often linked to aging manifestations .
To this effect , the <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> mouse model will serve as a unique genetic tool to probe selective , multiple and novel pathways , which may have not been anticipated to be linked to metabolic processes and allied pathophysiological states .
Model Depicting a Role of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> and Some of Its Partners in Metabolic and Neuronal Function .
<termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> interacts with <termsem="EG:1353"> Cox11 </term> and <termsem="EG:3098"> HKI </term> and the triad is in equilibrium under normal physiological conditions .
<termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> prevents the inhibition of <termsem="EG:3098"> HKI </term> by <termsem="EG:1353"> Cox11 </term> and its degradation .
The ultimate effect of <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> on its partners is the stimulation of the glycolytic pathway and production of ATP .
The glycolytic pathway is critical to fuel the constitutive Na + / K + - ATPase pump to maintain the dark current between the inner and outer segment compartments of photosensory neurons .
A deficit ( haploinsufficiency ) in <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> disturbs the equilibrium between <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> , <termsem="EG:3098"> HKI </term> , and <termsem="EG:1353"> Cox11 </term> .
This pathophysiological event promotes the destabilization and degradation of <termsem="EG:3098"> HKI </term> and a decrease in ATP production required to maintain the depolarization state neurons , and , hence , a reduction in the response of receptoral and postreceptoral neurons .
A reduction in ATP levels also negatively modulates <termsem="EG:3098"> HKI </term> activity/level .
Decreased levels of <termsem="EG:3098"> HKI </term> promote intracellular hyperglycemia and activate stress kinases , which modulate negatively the Na + / K + - ATPase pump by phosphorylation .
Pathophysiological pathways promoted by <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> haploinsufficiency are represented by dash lines .
RIS , rod inner segment ; ROS , rod outer segment .
Finally , <termsem="EG:785768"> RanBP2 </term> appears to join other nucleoporins , such as Nup96 [ 58 ] , in novel physiological functions that are vital for complex organisms and that were not anticipated from cell-based studies .
The reduced expression of these proteins in whole-animal models generates phenotypes that are tissue-restricted and more importantly , do not seem to recapitulate phenotypes observed with knockdown experiments in cell-based culture assays .
For example , short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RanBP2 [ 9 ] and members of the Nup107-Nup160 complex [ 59 -- 61 ] have shown , respectively , to cause mitotic arrest and disruption of nuclear pore assembly and deficits in mRNA export in cell culture .
Yet , haploinsufficiency of <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> ( this work ) and Nup96 [ 58 ] predominantly produce , instead , CNS-restricted deficits in energy metabolism and alterations in the immune system linked to the down-regulation of <termsem="EG:15977"> interferon- </term> - regulated proteins and increased susceptibility of viral infection , respectively .
While these apparent outcome disparities among experimental systems remain unclear , they could potentially result from variations in redundancies and compensatory mechanisms inherent to each experimental system .
Regardless , these genetic and whole-animal models set the stage to probe novel molecular pathways in various physiological and genetic contexts , and provide also a link to pathophysiological processes underlying several human diseases .
Yeast two-hybrid screening and assays .
The LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> human RanBP2 </term> ( residues 62 -- 711 ) was subcloned in-frame into the GAL4 DNA-binding domain of bait vector , pBUTE ( a kanamycin-resistant version of GAL4 bait vector pGBDUC1 ) [ 62 ] and HybriZAP pBD-GAL4 vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , California , United States ) .
The former was used to screen ~ 18 million clones via mating from murine 9 - to 10-d-old embryo and brain cDNA libraries at the Molecular Interaction Facility ( MIF ) , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin .
The latter was used to screen via transformation of ~ 5 million clones from bovine retinal cDNA libraries [ 32 ] .
The screens generated six clones .
One and two in-frame clones were independently isolated from the embryonic and adult brain libraries , respectively , and the interactions were validated .
The three clones encoded Cox11 .
Interactions between Cox11 , LD , and subdomains thereof were quantified by liquid -galactosidase ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , California , United States ) and growth assays [ 63 ] .
The maximum specific growth speed ( max ) was determined by calculating max = ( ln ( xt )  ln ( x0 ) ) / t , where xt is the OD600 of the culture at t = t , x0 is the OD600 at t = 0 and t is the time between x0 and xt .
Assays were performed with three independent clones and three samples of each clone , the results were averaged , and the standard deviations calculated .
Site-directed and deletion mutagenesis and plasmid construction .
Deletion mutagenesis was carried out with pairs of primers against domains of interest described in the figure legends .
PCR products were subcloned into pGEX-KG [ 64 ] , HybriZAP pBD-GAL4 vector ( Stratagene ) , and pBUTE [ 62 ] vectors .
GST-LDZIP alone comprised residues 447 -- 483 of <termsem="EG:5903"> human RanBP2 </term> .
GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays .
CHAPS-solubilized retinal extracts , expression , and purification of GST-fused constructs were prepared as previously described [ 65 ] .
GST pull-down assays were carried out with 0.5 -- 2.2 M of GST-fused proteins [ 65 ] .
Co-precipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies described in the Results section .
Unfolded and partially denatured Cox11 were generated by incubating recombinant and native Cox11 overnight with 5.6 and 7 M guanidine hydrochloride and urea , respectively .
The Cox11 conformers were then diluted ~ 20-fold in CHAPS-binding buffer containing GST-LD .
Immunoprecipitation assays with 5 g of antibody and Western blots ( ~ 200 -- 400 ng/ml of antibody ) were performed exactly as described previously [ 13 ] .
Hexokinase I assay .
Hexokinase I activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 25 C by the method of coupling the glucose-6-phosphate production via glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with the change in the absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm and as described by [ 66 ] .
The reaction was started by the addition of purified brain hexokinase I ( 0.24 g ) ( gift from J. Wilson ) to 1.0 ml of reaction mixture containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl ( pH 8.5 ) , 7.4 mM MgCl2 , 6.6 mM ATP , 0.65 mM NADP , 11.1 mM monothioglycerol , and 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase .
In the case of hexokinase activity measured in the presence of Cox11 and LD , the purified HKI was incubated with the recombinant proteins for 15 min at 4 C before measurement of the activity .
The data were fitted directly into the Michaelis-Menten equation using SIGMAPLOT ( SPSS Science ) .
Antibodies .
Rabbit antisera were raised against the recombinant murine Cox11 ( residues 40 -- 275 ) and affinity-purified under non-denaturing conditions ( Stereogene ) as previously described [ 13 ] .
Cox11 antibodies were used at 200 ng/ml for Western analysis .
The monoclonal antibody Hsp70 was from Affinity Bioreagents ( Golden , Colorado , United States ) and antibodies against the KBD ( JX2 ) and ZnF domains of RanBP2 have been described [ 13,16 ] .
Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against Hexokinase I were provided by J. Wilson .
The mAb414 was purchased from Abcam ( Cambridge , Massachusetts , United States ) .
Immunocytochemistry and microscopy .
Retina dissections , radial cryosections ( ~ 6 m ) , and immunohistochemistry procedures were carried out as described elsewhere [ 19 ] .
Brains from 3 - to 5-mo-old C57Bl/6 mice were fixed overnight in 2 % paraformaldehyde , infused with 30 % sucrose , and processed for cryosectioning .
Primary brain neurons and glial cells were prepared from the cerebral cortex .
This was macerated in the Hank 's Balanced Salt solution and triturated .
Primary cells were cultured in DMEM ( GIBCO , San Diego , California , United States ) and collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes ( MatTek Corporation , Ashland , Maine ) at 5 % CO2/37 C for ~ 2 d and processed for immunocytochemistry .
Primary antibodies were used at concentrations ~ 2.5 -- 10 g/ml .
Alexa 488 - and Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies ( 2.5 g/ml ) ( Molecular Probes ) were used for visualization of proteins .
Crossover of fluorescent probes , background , and autofluorescence were found to be negligible .
Visualization of specimens and localization of proteins were carried out by wide-field epifluorescence microscopy on Nikon ( Tokyo , Japan ) E600 upright and TE2000U inverted research microscopes equipped with similar Apochromat objectives .
Images with the Nikon E600 were acquired with a SPOT-RT digital camera coupled to the microscope and driven by SPOT Imaging v4 .0 software ( Diagnostic Instruments , Sterling Heights , Michigan , United States ) .
All images were captured at nonsaturating integration levels , 12-bit mono black/white , and then pseudo-colored .
Protein colocalization analysis was carried out on the Nikon TE2000U microscope equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filter wheels , cube filters , 100 W mercury light source , Nomarski/DIC , and Plan Apochromat optics ( 100  , 60  , and 40  oil objectives with NA of 1.4 , 40  LWD , and 20  LWD objectives and encoded motorized Z-Stage ( Prior Scientific , Rockland , Maryland , United States ) .
Images with the inverted Nikon TE2000U microscope were obtained using a CCD camera ( CoolSNAP HQ ; Roper Scientific , Trenton , New Jersey , United States ) .
Images acquired under identical acquisition parameters were analyzed using Metamorph Software v6 .2 ( Universal Imaging , Glendale , Wisconsin , United States ) .
Whenever applicable , serial optical Z-stacks ( 20 -- 30 focal planes at 100-nm intervals ) were captured and computationally processed by 3-D blind deconvolution methods with the same software .
Generation of a mouse line with a disrupted <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> locus and histological analysis of trapped <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> mice .
A feeder-independent mouse ES cell line derived from the 129P2/OlaHsd strain and harboring a disrupted <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> locus by insertion mutagenesis with the gene trap vector , pGT0pfs [ 67,68 ] ( generated by W. Skarnes ) , was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center ( University of California Davis , Davis , California , United States ) .
The gene trap vector contains a promoterless neo-lacZ fusion gene with a splice acceptor site at the 5  end followed by an internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) and the <termsem="EG:250"> human placental alkaline phosphatase </term> ( PLAP ) reporter cassette .
The <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> 129Ola ES line was injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts and four male chimeras were generated .
These were bred into 129P2/OlaHsd ( Harlan , Indianapolis , Indiana , United States ) and C57BL/6J ( Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Maine , United States ) females .
The two resulting and independent F1s lines , with 129P2/OlaHsd inbred and 129P2/OlaHsd/C57BL / 6J mixed genetic backgrounds , were tested for germline transmission by PCR and Southern blot analysis of tail genomic DNA .
-gal and <termsem="EG:250"> PLAP </term> activities in whole mount embryos and retinal sections were detected , respectively , by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl -D-galactopyranoside and AP staining buffer ( 0.1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate , 1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium in 100 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 9.5 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 ) as described elsewhere [ 67,68 ] .
Western blot and quantitation analysis of protein expression and ATP levels .
Homogenates and detergent solubilized extracts of tissues and immunoblots were prepared as described elsewhere [ 69 ] .
Quantitation of immunoblot bands calibrated against internal marker bands , such as <termsem="EG:15526"> mHsp70 </term> and <termsem="EG:218210"> Nup153 </term> , was carried out with Gel Pro Analyzer ( MediaCybernetics , San Diego , California , United States ) .
For determination of ATP levels , freshly dissected and flash-frozen tissues were homogenized in 2.5 % trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) , neutralized , and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 % with Tris-Acetate ( pH 7.75 ) .
ATP measurements were carried out with the ENLITEN ATP Assay System Bioluminescence Detection Kit for ATP ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin , United States ) as per the manufacturer 's instruction in SpectraMax-M5 ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , California , United States ) .
Protein concentration was measured by the BCA method ( BioRad , Hercules , California , United States ) using <termsem="EG:280717"> BSA </term> as a standard .
Metabolic assays .
Two groups of male mice were kept under separate diet since gestation or birth .
One group was fed with a normal chow diet ( PicoLab Rodent Diet 20  5053 ; LabDiet , Richmond , Indiana , United States ) , while the other was placed on a higher energy and fat diet ( PicoLab Mouse Diet 20  5058 ; LabDiet ) .
Glucose tolerance test was performed on overnight-fasted mice injected intraperitoneally with 2 g of glucose per kg of body weight .
Venous blood glucose values were determined at immediately before ( 0 min ) , and 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120 min after the injection with an automatic glucose monitor instrument ( One Touch Ultra , Lifescan ) .
<termsem="EG:3630"> Insulin </term> tolerance test was performed the same way as that described for the glucose tolerance test with the exception that <termsem="EG:3630"> human insulin </term> ( 0.75 U/kg of body mass ) was injected intraperitoneally in non-fasted mice .
Pyruvate challenge test was performed the same way as that described for the glucose tolerance test with the exception that pyruvate dissolved in saline ( 2 g/kg of body mass ) was injected intraperitoneally in overnight-fasted mice .
Electroretinography .
Five ~ 6-mo-old male <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> + /  mice in 129ola background were kept in dim cyclic light ( 10 lux ) for 2 wk before electroretinographic responses were recorded .
The mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine ( 80 mg/kg ) and xylazine ( 4 mg/kg ) .
Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad at 37.5  1 C throughout the recording .
The pupils were fully dilated with 0.5 % tropicamide and 2.5 % phenylephrine HCl , and both eyes were recorded simultaneously .
Corneal gold-wire loops were used as the active electrodes under 0.5 % proparacaine hydrochloride topical anesthesia .
Gold-wire electrodes placed on the sclera near the limbus served as reference electrodes .
A ground wire was attached to the ear .
Scotopic responses were recorded from threshold to 9 log units of intensity above threshold , amplified , and filtered ( 5,000 gain , 0.1 -- 1,000 Hz ) .
For photopic recordings background light at 34 cd/m2 was used to suppress rod function .
Western Blot Analysis of the Association of LD of <termsem="EG:5903"> RanBP2 </term> with HKI and Cox11 across Tissues .
GST-JX2 ( 2.2 M ) was incubated with different tissue extracts ( ~ 2.0 mg ) and the GST-JX2 coprecipitates from seven different tissues were analyzed by Western blot with the antibodies against HKI and Cox11 .

Immunostaining of Radial Cryosections of Wild-Type ( + / + ) and Heterozygote ( + /  ) <termsem="EG:19386"> RanBP2 </term> Mice Retinas with Anti-HKI and  Cox11 Antibodies .
A1 and B1 represent magnifications of just the distal section of the retina ( inner segment subcellular compartment of the photosensory neuron layer ) .
Note the partial delocalization of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> to the myoid subcompartment of the inner segment of photoreceptor neurons in + /  mice ( B1 ) and decreased levels of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> in the inner plexiform ( synaptic ) layer of the retina ( A and B ) .
This is reflected by a significant increase and decrease of the mean fluorescence intensity ( in arbitrary units ) of <termsem="EG:15275"> HKI </term> in the myoid and inner plexiform ( synaptic ) layers , respectively ( E ) .
AU , arbitrary unit ; ROS , rod outer segment ; RIS , rod inner segment ; ONL , outer nuclear layer ; OPL , outer plexiform layer , INL , inner nuclear layer ; IPL , inner plexiform layer ; GCL , ganglion cell layer ; E and M are , respectively , the ellipsoid ( mitochondria-rich ) and myoid compartments of photosensory neurons .
