Pygo1 and Pygo2 roles in <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in mammalian <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
The pygopus gene of Drosophila encodes an essential component of the Armadillo ( -catenin ) <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> complex of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
To better understand the functions of Pygopus-mediated canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> , targeted mutations were made in the two mammalian orthologs , Pygo1 and Pygo2 .
Each mutation deleted > 80 % of the coding sequence , including the critical PHD domain , and almost certainly resulted in null function .
Pygo2 homozygous mutants , with rare exception , <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> shortly after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , with a phenotype including lens agenesis , <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation , altered <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> , and in some cases exencephaly and cleft palate .
Pygo1 homozygous mutants , however , were viable and fertile , with no detectable <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> defects .
Double Pygo1/Pygo2 homozygous mutants showed no apparent synergy in phenotype severity .
The BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> showed reduced levels of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - mutants , with tissue-specific variation in degree of diminution .
The Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes both showed widespread <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney , with raised levels in the stromal cell compartment .
Confocal analysis of the double mutant kidneys showed disturbance of both the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme-derived compartments .
Branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud was altered , with <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> tips and reduced tip density , probably contributing to the smaller size of the mutant kidney .
In addition , there was an <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the zone of condensed mesenchyme capping the ureteric bud .
Nephron <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , however , proceeded normally .
Microarray analysis showed changed expression of several genes , including Cxcl13 , Slc5a2 , Klk5 , Ren2 and Timeless , which represent candidate Wnt targets in <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
The mammalian Pygopus genes are required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud during <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
Nevertheless , the relatively mild phenotype observed in the kidney , as well as other organ systems , indicates a striking evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between mammals and Drosophila .
In mammals , the Pygo1/Pygo2 genes are not absolutely required for canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in most <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> systems , but rather function as quantitative transducers , or modulators , of Wnt signal intensity .
<termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> is of critical importance in several stages of <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
Mutual <termsem="GO:0031128"> inductive </term> interactions between the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> [ 1 ] .
The ureteric bud <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesizes </term> Wnt9b , which is essential for <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of the mesenchyme to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> nephrons [ 2 ] .
Wnt4 is <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> by the <termsem="GO:0031128"> induced </term> metanephric mesenchyme and is also required for <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> [ 3 ] .
Furthermore , Wnt11 , <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> by the ureteric bud tips , participates in a positive feedback loop <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> glial cell line-derived <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factor ( GDNF ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> by the metanephric mesenchyme [ 4 ] .
Mutations in Wnt9b or Wnt4 result in a dramatic block in nephron <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , while Wnt11 mutants show a significant reduction in nephron number .
It is interesting to note that Wnt4 and Wnt11 have been shown to <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal </term> , at least in some cases , through noncanonical pathways [ 5-7 ] , while there is evidence indicating that Wnt9b activates canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the kidney [ 2 ] .
Genetic studies in Drosophila have identified the Pygopus ( Pygo ) gene as a critical component of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> [ 8-11 ] .
Pygo and Lgs interact with -catenin during the formation of the canonical <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> complex and are required for accumulation of -catenin in the nucleus [ 12 ] .
Lgs <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> the central armadillo repeats of -catenin , while Pygo interacts with Lgs , mediating activation of Wnt targets [ 9,13 ] .
The N-terminal domain of Pygo is required for Wnt <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> activation , while the PHD motif is required for the association of Pygo with Lgs [ 9,13 ] .
Additionally , a putative nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> signal ( NLS ) was identified within the N-terminal domain of Pygo , suggesting a possible role of <termsem="GO:0051170"> nuclear importation </term> of -catenin [ 8,11 ] .
Analyses of multiple aspects of the pygopus mutant phenotype indicate that this gene is dedicated to , and required for , canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> during Drosophila <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 9 ] .
The mammalian genome carries two , and only two , orthologs of Drosophila Pygo , Pygo1 and Pygo2 [ 8,9,14 ] .
In this report , we generated targeted mutations of Pygo1 and Pygo2 to determine their functions , with a particular interest in the contributions of these genes to canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> during <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
The resulting double-homozygous mutant embryos showed a context-dependent reduction in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> as measured by Wnt reporter transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Development </term> remained , however , surprisingly normal , with survival to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and few apparent defects in most organ systems .
Our phenotypic analysis focused on the kidney , which showed altered branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud , and <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the zone of condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud , yet relatively normal nephron <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , as measured by histology , confocal analysis , in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> and microarray analysis .
The obvious conclusion is that in mammals , unlike Drosophila , Pygopus-mediated canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> is not absolutely necessary in most <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> organ systems .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 targeted mutations .
We targeted both the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes by inserting LoxP sequences to flank critical coding regions including the PHD domains .
The resulting targeted mice were <termsem="GO:0007618"> mated </term> with transgenic CMV-Cre mice [ 15 ] to <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> germline LoxP <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> , resulting in the null mutant alleles that were used for this study .
PCR confirmed the deletion of the bulk of the coding sequences for both genes , including 89 % of coding sequence for Pygo1 and 87 % of coding sequence for Pygo2 .
Previous studies in Drosophila have shown that even a single missense mutation in the PHD domain can eliminate Pygo function in <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> [ 8 ] .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 mutant phenotypes .
Pygo1 homozygous null mice were viable and fertile with no <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> defects detectable .
This was surprising given the importance of the pygopus gene in <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in Drosophila , and the reported expression during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of the mouse Pygo1 gene in , for example , the brain , limbs , kidney and branchial arches [ 14,16 ] ( Yu J , Valerius MT , McMahon AP , contribution to GUDMAP , ) .
The Pygo2 homozygous null mice survived to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , but with rare exceptions , <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> shortly afterwards .
The gut , heart and limbs <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> without detectable abnormality ( data not shown ) despite known requirements for <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
The Pygo2 mutants did , however , show <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation , lens agenesis and a kidney phenotype with high penetrance , exencephaly , and cleft palate with incomplete penetrance .
Double-homozygous mutant Pygo1 and Pygo2 mice had a phenotype similar to that of single Pygo2 nulls ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) .
There was no significant synergism of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities in the double mutants .
Together these results suggest that Pygo2 is required for the proper <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of a limited number of structures , whereas Pygo1 is not necessary for normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant embryos .
( A ) E18 .5 Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - embryos , with only one wild-type Pygo2 allele , appeared normal .
( B , C ) Double homozygous mutant Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - embryos were smaller , with eye defects including absent or rudimentary lens and folded pigmented retina ( arrows ) .

<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Pygo1 and Pygo2 in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> has been used previously to characterize <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Pygo1 [ 14,16 ] ( Yu J , Valerius MT , McMahon AP , contribution to GUDMAP , ) .
In this report , we used immunofluorescence to better define the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney .
Both genes were widely <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> , showing nuclear localization of encoded proteins in the ureteric bud , capping mesenchyme , and stromal cells ( Figure 2 ) .
Raised <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Pygo1 , and to a lesser degree of Pygo2 , was seen in stromal cells , and significant nuclear staining was detected in essentially all cells of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney for both proteins .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the E18 .5 <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney .
Immunofluorescence was used to determine <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 proteins in the cortex of the E18 .5 kidney .
Both Pygo1 and Pygo2 ( red ) were <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> in the nucleus , as expected .
Both genes showed widespread <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , with signal detected in all components of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney , but with elevated levels in the stromal cell compartment ( arrows ) .
Epithelial cells , primarily ureteric bud in these sections , were labeled blue using E-cadherin antibody .
Original magnification  200 .
Confocal analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant kidneys .
Histological examination of Pygo2 null and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null mutant kidneys did not reveal any abnormalities in <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> ( data not shown ) .
Confocal analysis was therefore performed to characterize <termsem="GO:0001822"> renal development </term> in E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys more precisely ( Figure 3 ) .
Wt1 ( red ) and Cited1 ( red ) antibodies both stain the capping metanephric mesenchyme around the ureteric bud tips [ 17 ] .
WT1 antibody also stains renal vesicles and glomerular anlage .
Antibodies to Cdh1 , also known as E-cadherin ( blue ) , were used to identify epithelial structures , including the <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> ureteric bud and nascent nephrons of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney [ 18 ] .
Dolichos biflorus ( DBA ) lectin [ 16 ] was used to selectively stain ureteric bud-derived structures [ 19 ] .
Confocal analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant E18 .5 kidneys .
( B , D ) Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - mutant E18 .5 kidneys and ( A , C ) kidneys of normal littermates were stained using antibodies to ( C , D ) Cited1 or ( A , B ) Wt1 , both <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the condensing metanephric mesenchyme , and colored as red , Cdh1 , a general marker of epithelia ( blue ) , and DBA lectin staining the ureteric tree [ 16 ] .
Confocal Z-sections were obtained every 5 m for 75 -- 80 m .
A reduced number of ureteric tips per area was observed in ( B , D ) the Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys compared with ( A , C ) control littermates .
In addition , ureteric bud tips were often more dilated in Pygo1/2 null mutants compared with controls .
The condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud was also significantly <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> in the mutants .
Original magnification  200 .
Wt1 and Cited1 ( red ) staining revealed an increase of approximately 30 % in the thickness of the capping mesenchyme surrounding the mutant ureteric buds ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ) .
Nevertheless , the mutant metanephric mesenchyme underwent relatively normal <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> .
Cdh1-staining nephrons ( blue ) were identified connecting to the ureteric bud tips [ 16 ] and extending into the medulla of the kidney , as normal .
Intermediate structures of <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> , including renal vesicles , comma-shaped bodies , and S-shaped bodies appeared normal .

* Significant change ( P < 0.01 ) between the three groups .
SD , Standard deviation ; n , number .
Confocal analysis also showed that the ureteric bud tips [ 16 ] of Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys were dilated and misshaped compared with those of littermates with at least one wild-type Pygo2 allele ( Figure 3 ) .
In addition , the Pygo1/Pygo2 double-homozygous mutant kidneys also had a decrease of approximately 25 % in the number of ureteric bud tips per area compared with littermates with at least one wild-type copy of Pygo2 ( Table 2 ) .
No significant difference in ureteric bud-tip density was seen between Pygo2 + / - and Pygo2 + / + embryos ( P = 0.33 ) .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
We examined expression of three Wnt genes in Pygo mutants .
Wnt7b is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the stalks [ 20 ] , Wnt11 in the tips [ 4 ] , and Wnt9b in the stalks and weakly in the tips of the <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> ureteric bud [ 2 ] .
All three genes showed similar <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns in Pygo2 + / + and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-mutant kidneys ( Figure 4 ) .
In addition , these in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> patterns confirmed the confocal microscopy results , showing a reduced number of tips ( Wnt11-positive ) per surface area in the Pygo1/Pygo2 double-homozygous mutants .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Wnt7b , Wnt9b , and Wnt11 in E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 compound null kidneys .

The mutant kidneys showed normal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns for the ureteric stalk markers Wnt7b and Wnt9b , and reduced density of ureteric tips as measured by Wnt11 .

Reduced canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant mice .
The BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> [ 21 ] was used to examine changes in <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the mutant mice .
Both Pygo2 - / - and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null E10 .5 embryos showed a decrease in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> ( Figure 5 ) .
There was , however , tissue-specific variability in the degree of reduction , with the somites , for example , showing strong reduction , while the mutant telencephalon still showed robust <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
These results suggest that the mammalian Pygo genes are significant modulators of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in some , but not in all <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> systems .
Reduced canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in Pygo2 and Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant embryos .
E10 .5 embryos , all with the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
( A ) Pygo1 + / + / Pygo2 + / - embryos showed normal X-gal staining in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> brain , pharyngeal pouches , otic vesicle , apical ectodermal ridges of the fore and hind limb buds , and in somites .
( B ) Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 - / - embryos , with loss of both Pygo2 alleles , showed reduced but not absent BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in many <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> structures , including pharyngeal pouches , otic vesicle , and somites .
( C ) Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - embryo , with mutation of both Pygo1 alleles , but one wild-type Pygo2 allele , showed normal BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
( D ) Double-homozygous mutant Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - embryos still showed some remaining BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , suggesting residual canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
Embryos in panels ( A ) and ( B ) were from the same litter and were processed in parallel , while embryos in ( C ) and ( D ) were from a separate litter , also processed in parallel , and were slightly more <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmentally </term> advanced .
Original magnification ( A , B )  20 ; ( C , D )  16 .
We also examined BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in more detail in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> urogenital system of Pygo mutants .
The results suggested that the Pygo2 gene is required for canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the nephric duct .
Both Pygo2 null and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null E10 .5 embryos showed an absence of reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the nephric duct , while control littermates showed strong <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 6A -- C ) .
In Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null mutants , the nephric duct did <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> , however , and give rise to the ureteric bud outgrowth , which showed reduced but not absent BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 6A -- C ) .

Reporter activity was present in the ureteric compartments of the Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / + ( left ) and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - ( middle ) kidneys , but lost in the Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - ( right ) kidney .

At E13 .5 , the Pygo2 gene appeared to play a major role , and the Pygo1 gene a minor role , in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the ureteric tree , as measured by BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
A negative control kidney , without the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene , showed minimal background X-gal staining ( Figure 6D ) , whereas a BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgenic kidney with at least one wild-type Pygo2 gene showed strong X-gal staining in the ureteric tree ( Figure 6E ) .
In contrast , Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 - / - E13 .5 kidneys showed very weak reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 6F ) , suggesting a significant loss of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
Homozygous loss of the Pygo1 gene alone , however , had a small effect on reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 6G -- H ) .
Homozygous mutation of both the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes gave a more dramatic reduction of BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> than loss of Pygo2 alone ( Figure 6F , L ) .
The Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes were also required for BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the paramesonephric ( Mullerian ) ducts .
In Pygo2 - / - mice , there was a significant loss of reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( data not shown ) , and double-homozygous mutants showed loss of X-gal staining in the paramesonephric ducts ( Figure 6K ) , whereas Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - and Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / - mice showed normal levels of BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 6G , H , J ) .
BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter analysis of the Pygo mutants at a later <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stage , E18 .5 , also identified a significant decrease in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the cortical ureteric branches and renal pelvis of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney ( Figure 6M -- O ) .
Cortical X-gal staining was seen in the ureteric branches of a Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / - kidney ( Figure 6M , left ) , but was completely absent in the cortex of a Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 - / - kidney ( Figure 6M , right ) .
Bisection revealed a significant loss of X-gal staining cells in the collecting ducts and renal pelvis of the Pygo2 null kidney compared with control littermates ( Figure 6N ) .
Side by side comparison of Pygo1 + / + / Pygo2 + / - ( Figure 6O , left ) , Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - ( Figure 6O , middle ) , and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - ( Figure 6O , right ) E18 .5 kidneys suggested a significant role for the Pygo2 gene in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the ureteric tree and its derivatives .
In order to validate and quantify the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> changes in the Pygo2 null and Pygo1/Pygo2 nulls , we performed ELISA measurements of transgene specific <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> levels in E18 .5 kidneys ( Figure 7 ) .
Loss of the Pygo2 gene ( Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 - / - and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - ) gave greater than 90 % reduction in BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Loss of Pygo1 alone ( Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / + ) did not result in a significant change .
Interestingly , however , the Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - showed only 50 % of wild-type BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , suggesting a minor contribution by Pygo1 in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
Although BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was decreased in the E18 .5 Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / - kidney , confocal analysis of kidneys with this genotype revealed no dilated ureteric tips or significant changes in ureteric tip number per area compared with Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 + / + kidneys ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , these BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter results suggest a significant role for the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of the ureteric tree of the kidney .
Quantitative analysis of BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Pygo1/Pygo2 E18 .5 kidney extracts .
Transgene-specific <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> beta-galactosidase </term> </term> was quantified by ELISA analysis .
Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / + , Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / - and Pygo1 + / - / Pygo2 + / + kidneys all showed similar levels of BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
In the Pygo2 hetereozygote , Pygo1 homozygous mutants , however , reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was reduced by about 50 % .
In Pygo2 homozygous mutants BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was uniformly low , with or without wild-type Pygo1 alleles .
Each experimental group included a sample size of at least four .
Interestingly , however , even in wild-type mice the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> reporter showed no <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> metanephric mesenchyme , or metanephric mesenchyme-derived structures , such as renal vesicles , S-shaped bodies , tubules , and glomeruli .
This has been reported previously , and was interpreted to indicate the absence of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the metanephric mesenchyme [ 21 ] .
Results from other studies , however , argue for the presence of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the metanephric mesenchyme .
For example , ureteric bud <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt1 , thought to act through canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> , can rescue Wnt9b mutants and <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> of the metanephric mesenchyme [ 2 ] .
This suggests that the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene might not accurately report canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the metanephric mesenchyme .
To address this question , we incubated E11 .5 metanephric mesenchyme in lithium chloride ( LiCl ) , which activates canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> through inhibition of GSK3 , and also functions as an inducer of <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> in kidney organ culture [ 22 ] .
We observed that LiCl-treated metanephric mesenchyme did undergo <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> , as expected , but failed to show BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this transgene is not an accurate reporter of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the metanephric mesenchyme of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney .
Microarray analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys .
To further examine possible disturbance of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in the Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant kidneys , we used microarrays to perform a global analysis of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> changes .
Whereas the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter <termsem="GO:0065007"> monitors </term> the <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> of one promoter to <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> , microarrays can be used to follow <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> changes of all genes , including all known Wnt targets .
E18 .5 wild-type and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - kidneys were examined in biological triplicate .
In total , 45 genes were identified as significantly changed , using a relatively low stringency screen of the data , with a p-value cutoff of < 0.05 , and fold change > 2 ( Table 3 ) .
Notably , both Pygo1 and Pygo2 were identified as <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> ( - 5.3-fold and - 3.9-fold , respectively ) in the mutant kidneys .
Other genes with significant decreases in mutant kidneys included Cxcl13 ( - 2.3-fold ) , Slc5a2 ( - 2.8-fold ) , and Slco1a4 ( - 2.1-fold ) .
Slc5a2 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the proximal tubules of the adult nephron and has been implicated in autosomal recessive renal glucosuria , characterized by loss of <termsem="GO:0046323"> glucose uptake </term> by the nephron [ 23 ] .
The <termsem="GO:0008514"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> organic anion transporter </term> </term> , Slco1a4 , is also strongly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the tubules of the adult kidney [ 24 ] .
These results suggest that the Pygo1/Pygo2 genes might play a role in nephron <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and subsequent function .
Genes differentially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> ( p < 0.05 , two-fold change or greater ) in the Pygo1/Pygo2 null E18 .5 kidney normalized to wild-type samples .
Noteworthy genes <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> in the Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidney included Klk5 ( 2.8-fold ) , Klk6 ( 2.7-fold ) , Ren2 ( 2.2-fold ) , and Timeless ( 2.4-fold ) .
Klk5 and Klk6 are members of the <termsem="GO:0004293"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> kallikrein </term> </term> family of <termsem="GO:0004295"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> trypsin </term> </term> - like <termsem="GO:0008236"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> serine proteases </term> </term> .
<termsem="GO:0004293"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Kallikreins </term> </term> have diverse functions in cancer , <termsem="GO:0048771"> tissue remodeling </term> , and <termsem="GO:0008217"> regulation of blood pressure </term> [ 25 ] .
Ren2 , a homolog of the <termsem="GO:0004175"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> endopeptidase </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0004195"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Renin </term> </term> 1 , activates the <termsem="GO:0003081"> <termsem="GO:0004195"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> renin </term> </term> - angiotensin system </term> , increasing blood pressure [ 26 ] .
Disruption of the <termsem="GO:0003081"> <termsem="GO:0004195"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> renin </term> </term> - angiotensin system </term> during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> results in congenital abnormalities of the ureter and collecting-duct system [ 27 ] .
Timeless , a <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> involved in the <termsem="GO:0042752"> regulation of <termsem="GO:0007623"> circadian rhythms </term> </term> , and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> ureteric tips , has also been shown to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0001658"> ureteric branching morphogenesis </term> [ 28 ] .
We were interested in the possible altered <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of previously known Wnt targets in the Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - mutant kidneys .
A list of known Wnt targets was compiled from .
Both Pygo1 and Pygo2 probe sets were included as references to illustrate significant <termsem="GO:0048519"> down regulation </term> .
Remarkably , the known Wnt target genes showed very few differences in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> between wild-type and mutant kidneys ( Figure 8 ) .
Only the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Ccnd1 encoding cyclin D1 [ 29 ] , and Wisp1 [ 30 ] were significantly changed , with <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level changes of < 1.5-fold in Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys .
These results indicate an absence of dramatic changes in expression of previously known <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> target genes in the Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant kidneys .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Gene expression </term> changes of common <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> targets in the E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidney .
Microarray analysis was performed in triplicate on wild-type and Pygo1/2 compound null E18 .5 kidneys .
Possible Wnt targets were selected from those compiled at [ 39 ] .
An initial gene list of 82 Wnt targets was created and then reduced to a total of 40 genes using an <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level restriction requiring the raw <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> intensity to be > 100 in at least 3 samples .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 probes were included to demonstrate significant changes in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> levels .
We used quantitative real-time PCR , with independent biological samples , to validate the microarray results .
Nine genes were tested , and for seven we did observe a significant fold change in the same direction predicted by the microarray results ( Table 4 ) .
It is not surprising that two of the nine genes could not be validated , considering the relatively low stringency used in screening the microarray data .
Validation of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> changes in the E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys normalized to E18 .5 wild-type kidneys .
In Drosophila , the Pygopus gene is a key mediator of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
In one study , 12 distinct measures of <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in Pygo mutants were performed , including analysis of leg , wing , and eye imaginal discs .
In 2 cases there was a significant reduction of <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> and in 10 cases a complete block [ 10 ] .
A second study in Drosophila examined the effects of Pygo mutation on <termsem="GO:0035017"> cuticle patterning </term> , midgut constriction , central nervous system , and <termsem="GO:0007507"> cardiac development </term> , and concluded that `` Pygo is an essential component in the Wg <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal transduction pathway </term> '' .
[ 8 ] .
Given these results in Drosophila , the relatively mild phenotypes of mice with targeted Pygo1 , Pygo2 , or double Pygo1/Pygo2 mutations were striking .
Pygo2 mutants <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and showed limited abnormalities , while Pygo1 homozygous mutants were normal and fertile .
Furthermore , there was no detected synergism in the phenotype of the double Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant , although in several tissues the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> Wnt reporter did show more a severe reduction in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
One possible explanation of these unexpected results is a failure of the gene targeting to eliminate functioning of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes .
The Pygopus deletion alleles described in this report , however , are almost certainly functional nulls .
In Drosophila , it has been shown that the PHD domain is absolutely necessary for Pygopus function in Wg <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
The PHD domain is 60 amino acids with seven cysteines and a histidine , predicted to <termsem="GO:0046911"> chelate </term> two zinc ions .
PHD domains are found in diverse proteins , including <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , and have been implicated in <termsem="GO:0006338"> chromatin remodeling </term> and protein-protein interactions [ 8 ] .
In Drosophila the pygoF107 allele , with a single missense mutation converting amino acid 802 in the PHD domain from cysteine to tyrosine , loses <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling function </term> in both <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> and <termsem="GO:0007444"> imaginal disc development </term> [ 8 ] .
The Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant alleles <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> in this report carried deletions of the entire PHD domains , as well as most other coding sequences .
For the Pygo1 gene , the coding region for 372 of 417 total amino acids was deleted , and for the Pygo2 gene , we deleted coding for 354 of 405 amino acids .
It is therefore very unlikely that the relatively mild phenotypes observed were the result of residual function of the targeted alleles .
We focused our analysis on the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney , in which <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> has been shown to be of critical importance in several stages of <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> .
Wnt9b is <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> by the ureteric bud and <termsem="GO:0031128"> induces </term> the metanephric mesenchyme to undergo <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> [ 2 ] .
Downstream of Wnt9b is Wnt4 [ 2 ] , which is <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> by the metanephric mesenchyme , and is also required for <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> [ 3 ] .
In addition , Wnt11 is <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> by the ureteric bud tips and induces GDNF <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the metanephric mesenchyme [ 4 ] .
In this report we describe a novel Wnt function in <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
The BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter indicated the presence of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the ureteric bud and its derivatives in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney .
Further , in the Pygo2 mutants this signal was lost , suggesting significant reduction of <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
In addition , we observed a resulting decrease in ureteric tip density , reduced kidney size and altered morphology of the ureteric tree in mutants , indicating a role for canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud .
While the simplest interpretation is direct <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> to the ureteric bud , it remains possible that the observed abnormalities are the result of indirect effects , with altered <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> to the metanephric mesenchyme then affecting mesenchyme to ureteric bud <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
The Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant phenotype of reduced branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud is surprisingly similar to that previously reported for Wnt11 mutants [ 4 ] .
The underlying mechanisms , however , are likely to be distinct .
Wnt11 is generally thought to act through a noncanonical pathway , ( although exceptions have been noted [ 31 ] ) , whereas the Pygopus genes <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
Further , the Wnt11 mutants showed an altered feedback loop between <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> from the ureteric bud to the mesenchyme and GDNF <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> from the mesenchyme to the bud , whereas in the Pygo1/Pygo2 mutants , we observed disrupted <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in the ureteric bud .
The Pygo1/2 mutants also showed an <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the zone of thickened mesenchyme that caps the ureteric bud .
Nevertheless , the mutant metanephric mesenchyme <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> nephrons normally .
This was particularly interesting , as Wnt9b <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> from the ureteric bud to the metanephric mesenchyme has been shown to <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> via canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> [ 2 ] .
The results in this report indicate a striking and surprising evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between Drosophila and mammals .
In Drosophila , the Pygopus gene is often required for canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> , while in mammals the Pygo1/Pygo2 genes appear to play a smaller role in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
The BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> showed reduced but generally not absent signal in Pygo1/Pygo2 mutant embryos , with tissue-specific variation in level of diminution .
In addition , the kidneys were not unique in showing surprisingly normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in Pygo1/Pygo2 mutants .
Indeed , <termsem="GO:0048513"> organogenesis </term> generally proceeded without detectable abnormality , with few exceptions .
These results suggest that the proteins encoded by mammalian Pygopus genes are often mere modulators of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> intensity , and not essential components .
The microarray results further support this conclusion .
Whereas the BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter <termsem="GO:0065007"> monitors </term> the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level of only one Wnt <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> promoter , the microarray allows the analysis of the activity levels of promoters of all genes .
Interestingly , the mutant kidneys showed <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene-expression </term> profiles surprisingly similar to wild type .
Some genes did , however , show <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> differences , and a high percentage of these differences could be validated by real-time PCR with independent biological samples .
Assuming that the Pygopus genes in mammals are dedicated to canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> , as has been previously shown in Drosophila , the genes with <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> differences represent candidate Wnt targets ( direct or indirect ) in <termsem="GO:0001822"> kidney development </term> .
We would predict these genes to show greater changes in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level in a <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> kidney with a more complete removal of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
In conclusion , the mammalian Pygo2 gene is required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud , with mutants showing dilated tips and reduced numbers of tips .
In addition , in Pygo2 mutants there was an <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the zone of metanephric mesenchyme that caps the ureteric buds .
Nevertheless , nephron <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> proceeded remarkably normally , even in Pygo1/Pygo2 double-homozygous mutants .
This was surprising considering the importance of the Pygopus gene in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in Drosophila , and the importance of canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> in <termsem="GO:0001822"> nephrogenesis </term> .
The results argue that the mammalian Pygopus genes are , in most <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> systems , only quantitative transducers of <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
Previous cell culture studies [ 32,33 ] and the reduced BAT - <termsem="GO:0015925"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gal </term> </term> transgene reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the Pygo1/Pygo2 knockout mice described in this report , do confirm an evolutionarily conserved function in canonical <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> .
In mammals , however , the phenotypic effects of Pygopus mutation are much milder than in Drosophila .
The degree of importance of the Pyg1/2 genes in <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> was context-dependent , but in general , mammalian <termsem="GO:0048513"> organogenesis </term> remained intact in Pygopus mutants .
Perhaps the simplest explanation is that in mammals , other genes show partial functional redundancy with the two Pygopus genes .
The -catenin <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> - factor </term> </term> complex includes a large and growing number of proteins , some of which may share the nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> and/or <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> activation functions of Pygo1/Pygo2 in mammals .
The identities and roles of these Pygopus redundant genes remain to be determined .
Targeting of Pygo1 and Pygo2 .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 genes were each targeted by flanking the critical coding regions of the third exon containing the PHD motif with LoxP sequences .
Targeting constructs were <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> using the Flp/Cre vector previously described [ 34 ] , which carries a neomycin-resistance gene flanked by FRT sequences , and three unique restriction sites for subcloning the two blocks of homology for <termsem="GO:0048518"> driving </term> <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> , and the critical region to be flanked by LoxP sequences .
For each construct , the three genomic segments required for subcloning were <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> by PCR from RI ES cell DNA .
The resulting targeting constructs were confirmed by sequencing .
For Pygo1 , the genomic sequences used for PCR were : 5 ' forward , GTGAAGGAGAGATGGATAAGTATG ; 5 ' back , TAGACCCTAACCACCTACAAG ; exon forward , GGTTAGGGTCTATGTGCTGG ; exon back , TCACCAAATCTCTGTTCTACAC ; 3 ' forward , TGTGTAGAACAGAGATTTGGTG ; 3 ' back , CAGTGAAGAAAGAGGGTCAG .
For Pygo2 , the genomic sequences used for PCR were : GCCTGGGTTGCTTGTCTTCTG and CCACCTTACTTGTGTGTGAGGATACATAC , CCAAGTCCCAGCATCTCTTAC and CCAGTCATACCAGCAACAAG , and exon sequences TGGGTGCTGGGAACAGAAC and CAACAACAACAGAAGACAAGC .
Linearized constructs were electroporated into RI ES cells , and resulting targeted ES cells used for C57/Bl6 blastocyst injections according to standard protocols .

The noon of the day that vaginal plugs were observed was designated E0 .5 .
Kidneys were dissected , fixed in paraformaldehyde , treated with methanol , and washed with PBS containing Tween-20 ( PBS-T ) prior to treatment with lectins and antibodies .
PBS-T was used for incubations of the tissues with fluoroscein - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> Dilichos biflorus aggutinin ( DBA , Vector ; Burlingame , USA ) , and PBS-T plus 2 % goat serum was used for incubations with the antibodies .
The primary antibodies were anti-WT1 ( c-19 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , anti-uvomorulin ( e-cadherin , Cdh1 , Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis , MO , USA ) , and anti-Cited1 ( Neomarkers-Lab Vision Corporation , Fremont , CA , USA ) .
The secondary antibodies were Alexa 555 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> anti-rabbit and Alexa 633 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> anti-rat antibodies ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) .
The tissues were imaged with a laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , New York , USA ) equipped with an argon ( 488 nm ) and two HeNe lasers ( 543 nm and 633 nm ) .
Optical sections approximately 2 m thick were obtained every 5 m to a depth of at least 65 m .

To <termsem="GO:0009058"> generate </term> anti-human Pygo2 ( anti-hPygo2 ) and anti-mouse Pygo1 ( anti-mPygo1 ) polyclonal antibodies , we subcloned cDNA by PCR corresponding to amino-acid residues 80 -- 327 of human Pygo 2 or amino-acid residues 76 -- 263 of mouse Pygo1 into pGEX4T1 ( Amersham Health , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) .
The PCR fragments of hPygo 2 and mPygo 1 lack both NHD and PHD conserved regions of hPygo2 and mPygo1 .
<termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> - hPygo2 and <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> - mPygo1 proteins were <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in bacteria , purified , and injected into rabbits for <termsem="GO:0002377"> <termsem="GO:0002378"> antibody production </term> </term> by ( Proteintech Group Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
The rabbit antisera of anti-mPygo1 and anti-hPygo2 were initially allowed to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to the <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> affinity matrix to remove any antibodies against <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> .
The anti-hPygo2 and anti-mPygo1 antisera were then separated from the <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> affinity matrix and allowed to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to the <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> - hPygo2 or <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> - mPygo1 affinity columns , respectively .
