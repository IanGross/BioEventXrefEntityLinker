Ataxia and peripheral nerve hypomyelination in ADAM22-deficient mice .
ADAM22 is a member of the ADAM gene family , but the fact that it is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> only in the nervous systems makes it unique .
ADAM22 's sequence similarity to other ADAMs suggests it to be an <termsem="GO:0005178"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> integrin binder </term> </term> and thus to have a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions .
To elucidate the physiological functions of ADAM22 , we employed gene targeting to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> ADAM22 knockout mice .
ADAM22-deficient mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> produced </term> in a good accordance with the Mendelian ratio and appeared normal at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
After one week , severe ataxia was observed , and all homozygotes <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> before weaning , probably due to convulsions .
No major histological abnormalities were detected in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum of the homozygous mutants ; however , marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves was observed .
The results of our study demonstrate that ADAM22 is closely involved in the correct functioning of the nervous system .
Further analysis of ADAM22 will provide clues to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases such as epileptic seizures and peripheral neuropathy .
ADAM ( A Disintegrin And <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Metalloprotease </term> </term> ) is a family of membrane-spanning multi-domain proteins containing a <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteinase </term> </term> - like domain and a disintegrin-like domain .
Currently , more than 30 ADAMs have been identified in mammals .
Their biological activities implicate ADAMs in <termsem="GO:0009566"> fertilization </term> , <termsem="GO:0007517"> myogenesis </term> and <termsem="GO:0022008"> neurogenesis </term> by <termsem="GO:0006508"> proteolysis </term> and <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> .
Some types of ADAM are catalytically active <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteases </term> </term> and shed the extracellular domains of membrane - <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factors </term> </term> or <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> [ 1,2 ] .
For example , ADAM17 ( TACE ) has been shown to <termsem="GO:0030908"> cleave </term> several substrates , including tumour necrosis factor alpha [ 3,4 ] , <termsem="GO:0008201"> heparin-binding </term> epidermal <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> - like <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> [ 6,7 ] and transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> alpha [ 8 ] .
Studies of ADAM17-null mice have revealed that ADAM17 is critical in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> and plays an essential role in the supply of <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factors </term> </term> [ 6,8 ] .
ADAMs are also involved in cell-cell or <termsem="GO:0007160"> cell-matrix adhesion </term> through their interaction with integrins or syndecans .
More than 10 ADAMs have been shown to support <termsem="GO:0033627"> integrin-mediated cell adhesion </term> in vitro [ 9 ] .
It has been reported that ADAM2-null and ADAM3-null male mutants are infertile and their spermatozoa lack egg - <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> abilities [ 10-12 ] .
Both ADAM2 and ADAM3 are not <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteases </term> </term> because they lack catalytic site sequences in their <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloprotease </term> </term> domain .
These studies clearly showed that non - <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> proteinase </term> </term> members of ADAMs also have significant roles in vivo .
We have reported the findings of ADAM11 , ADAM22 and ADAM23 genes and their restricted <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the human and murine nervous systems [ 13-15 ] .
Sequence analysis suggests that they are not <termsem="GO:0008237"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloproteases </term> </term> , since they all lack a catalytic motif .
It has been reported that ADAM23 protein is <termsem="GO:0051179"> localised </term> to the cell surface [ 16 ] , interacts with alpha-v beta-3 integrin heterodimer [ 17 ] and the disruption of ADAM23 gene in the mouse results in premature <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> associated with ataxia and tremor [ 18 ] .
Although the cause of <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in this mouse is unknown , for these phenotypes , impaired cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions in the nervous system caused by loss of ADAM23 may be responsible .
ADAM22 and ADAM23 share highly homologous sequences in their extracellular domains .
Especially , it is evident in their putative <termsem="GO:0005178"> integrin binding </term> loop sequences , CR ( E/D ) AVN ( E/D ) CD , which is located centre of the disintegrin domain .
These findings led us to hypothesize that ADAM22 is an <termsem="GO:0005178"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> integrin binder </term> </term> and plays an important role in the nervous system , as does ADAM23 .
To determine the physiological functions of ADAM22 , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> and analysed Adam22 gene-targeted mice .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of ADAM22-deficient mice .
Mice carrying a targeted mutation in their Adam22 gene were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> ( Fig. 1A ) .
Correct targeting events were confirmed by Southern blot analysis ( Fig. 1B ) .
Since the <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> termination </term> </term> codon was introduced in exon 8 in the pro-protein domain , only the truncated form of the ADAM22 protein would be <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesized </term> from this targeted allele .
Because a pro-protein domain is always removed in the mature functional ADAM-proteins by the <termsem="GO:0004276"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Furin </term> </term> - like <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> proteases </term> </term> and is thought to be non-functional itself , we considered that this truncated form of ADAM22 protein has no function .
Absence of mature ADAM22 protein in homozygous mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the specific antibody , which recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of the ADAM22 protein ( Fig. 1C ) .
Homozygous mutants showed no noticeable defects at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and were indistinguishable from wild-type or heterozygous littermates during the first week .
At postnatal day 10 ( P10 ) , most of the homozygous mutants were distinguishable by abnormalities such as reduced body weight and uncoordinated <termsem="GO:0050879"> movements </term> of their limbs .
After P10 , all homozygotes displayed severe ataxia ( Fig. 2 ) and began to <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> .
To measure the survival rate and body weight of each genotype precisely , we backcrossed heterozygous male mutants to C57BL/6 females more than 6 times .
The resulting ( N 6 ) heterozygous males and females were intercrossed and the <termsem="GO:0000003"> produced </term> offspring were analysed .
The numbers of survivors of each genotype every 5 days are shown in Table 1 .
At P10 , the ratio of each genotype was in close accordance with the Mendelian ratio ( 20.5 % + / + , 55.1 % + / - , 24.4 % - / - ; n = 78 ) .
This result shows that ADAM22 is not essential for <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> .
At P10 , the average body weight of homozygous mutants was approximately half that of wild-type and heterozygous littermates ( Table 2 ) .
Homozygous mutants <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> one by one after P10 , and all homozygotes <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> before P20 .
Of more than 100 homozygotes we have <termsem="GO:0000003"> produced </term> , none have survived more than 25 days after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Meanwhile , heterozygous mutants looked normal , were fertile , and survived for more than one year without obvious defects .
Histopathology of ADAM22-deficient mice .
We have reported the predominant <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ADAM22 mRNA in the human and mouse brain by Northern blot analysis [ 13,14 ] .
To determine the <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of ADAM22 transcript in the adult mouse CNS precisely , in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridisation </term> </term> analysis was performed using 35S-labeled RNA probe .
As shown in Fig. 3 , ADAM22 mRNA was <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the adult mouse CNS .
Strong signal was detected in the cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal formation .
In the spinal cord , <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridisation </term> </term> signal was restricted to the grey matter .
The <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of ADAM22 transcripts in the CNS was quite similar with that of ADAM11 , whose neuronal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> has been reported [ 19 ] .
These results suggest that the ADAM22 mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is neuronal in the mouse CNS .
Based on the <termsem="GO:0008298"> mRNA distribution </term> pattern , we performed immunohistopathological analysis of the cerebellum and hippocampus extensively .
Despite the high level of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ADAM22 mRNAs in the cerebellar granule cells , granule cell layer was normally <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> and Purkinje cell morphology ( calbindin-staining ) of the mutant mouse looked intact ( Figs. 4A -- D ) .
Hippocampal formation was also normally <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> ( Figs. 4I -- J ) .
These results suggest that <termsem="GO:0001764"> neuronal cell migration </term> was not impaired in the mutant mouse .
<termsem="GO:0032288"> Myelin-formation </term> detected by MBP ( myelin basic protein ) staining of the mutant in the cerebellum ( Fig. 4H ) and spinal cord ( Fig. 4L ) was also indistinguishable with the wild-type littermate ( Figs. 4G , K ) .
In summary , we could not find any signs of abnormalities in the mutant mouse brain by the light microscopic examination .
Next , the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of each genotype were analysed by toluidine blue stain , which reveals <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> .
Surprisingly , lack of myelin or thin myelin was observed in the sciatic nerves ( Fig. 5B ) and trigeminal nerves ( Fig. 5D ) in homozygous mutants .
Because no lesions were observed in the spinal cord ( Fig. 5F ) , it was suggested that Schwann cell specific <termsem="GO:0042552"> myelination </term> defect occurred in the homozygous mice .
To analyse the state of <termsem="GO:0042552"> myelinating </term> Schwann cells and axons , electron microscopic ( EM ) analysis of the sciatic nerve was performed ( Fig. 6 ) .
Schwann cells <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> thin or no myelin in the homozygous mutant ( Fig. 6B ) .
In contrast , heterozygous mice showed complete <termsem="GO:0042552"> myelination </term> ( Fig. 6A ) .
Morphology of the axons looked normal in each genotype .
Immunohistochemical analysis of the sciatic nerve showed that increased number of nuclei ( Fig. 7B ) and reduced staining of MBP ( Fig. 7D ) were remarkable in the homozygous mutant .
The Schwann cell marker , S100 staining signal was intensely observed in the homozygote as well as wild-type ( Figs. 7E , F ) .
These results suggest that proliferation of the Schwann cells was not impaired but <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is severely delayed in the ADAM22-deficient mice .
Novel ADAM22 transcript variants isolated from the peripheral nervous system .
In the case of human ADAM22 , isolation of five <termsem="GO:0008380"> splicing </term> variants and existence of two <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> terminating </term> </term> exons have been reported [ 13,20,21 ] .
However , the latter <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> terminating </term> </term> exon ( exon 31 ) of the mouse species has not been identified yet .
To isolate the long form of mouse ADAM22 transcripts , at first , we sought the mouse genome by BLAST homology search .
Search results showed that the mouse genome contig NT_039297 contained most of the mouse Adam22 gene .
In this contig sequence , we found putative exons 30 and 31 , those sequences were quite similar to human ADAM22 isoform 1 ( GenBank # NM_021723 ) .
To confirm existence of transcripts , we designed primers on the putative exon 31 and performed <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR using mouse cerebellum mRNA as a template .
TA-cloning of the amplified fragments and sequencing analysis showed that 5 of 8 clones were type 1 isoform ( G01 ) , 2 clones were type 3 isoform ( G03 ) and 1 clone ( G08 ) contained a novel exon between exons 29 and 30 .
Next , we performed <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR analysis of mRNAs purified from several adult mouse tissues , such as the spinal cord , dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) , sciatic nerve and cultured primary Schwann cells .
Interestingly , multiple DNA fragments were amplified from each tissue ( Fig. 8 ) , and length of major fragments in each lane was different .
For example , length of major amplified PCR fragments from the sciatic nerve ( Fig. 8A , lane 5 ) and cultured Schwann cells ( lane 6 ) were almost identical , and were shorter than those from other tissues .
In contrast , major fragments from the DRG ( lane 4 ) were longer than others .
We performed TA-cloning and sequencing to analyse exon organization of the amplified transcripts ( Fig. 8C ) .
Forty seven clones were isolated in total and were classified in 16 independent clones ( G01 -- G23 ) .
Comparison with the genomic sequence revealed the existence of 8 novel exons ( exons 27S , 27L , 29.1 , 29.3 , 29.5 , 29.7 , 30 and 31 ) .
These novel exons were flanked by well-defined introns that obey the GT-AG rule .
Exon organization of each clone was shown in Fig. 8C .
Characteristic feature of ADAM22 transcripts is tissue specific insertion or skipping of exons .
Because the number of nucleotides of exons 26 , 27 , 27L , 29.3 , 29.5 and 29.7 is a multiple of 3 , insertion or skipping of these exons will not change the downstream reading frame .
Known peptide motives were not found in the newly isolated sequences .
This <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR analysis is summarized as follows : ADAM22 transcripts were roughly subdivided in 3 groups , CNS-form ( containing exon 27 ) , DRG-form ( containing exon 27L ) and Schwann-cell-form ( skipping exon 26 and 27 ) .
From these results , we concluded that ADAM22 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in a cell-type specific manner , and plays an essential role in myelinogenesis in the PNS .
In the present study , we examined the function of ADAM22 by <termsem="GO:0000003"> generating </term> mice that lacked the Adam22 gene .
ADAM22-deficient mice exhibited severe ataxia and premature <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> .
In contrast , heterozygous mutants were healthy , fertile and survived more than 1 year without obvious abnormalities .
The cause of <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in the homozygous mutants is not clear ; however , it is likely to be due to multiple seizures .
This is because convulsive seizures were occasionally observed in homozygotes , after which the suffered mice appeared exhausted and , in most cases , <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> on the next day .
It is known that cortical dysplasia resulting from aberrant <termsem="GO:0007420"> brain development </term> causes seizure syndrome [ 22 ] .
For example , mice lacking the neuron-specific <termsem="GO:0016534"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> activator of cyclin 5 </term> </term> , p35 , exhibit seizures and a severe <termsem="GO:0001764"> neuronal migration </term> defect [ 23 ] .
Because ADAM22 protein is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> on the cell surface and is likely to be involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions , we hypothesized that depletion of ADAM22 would generate aberrant <termsem="GO:0001764"> neuronal migration </term> .
Histochemical analysis was performed to verify this hypothesis .
However , no marked abnormalities were observed in the mutant mouse brain , ruling out a critical role for ADAM22 in <termsem="GO:0001764"> neuronal migration </term> .
Another possible explanation is that the premature <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in first 2 weeks of life is caused by the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system .
Especially , nerves which <termsem="GO:0002087"> control </term> the breathing would be very important , because the respiration system undergoes significant <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> in the first 2 -- 3 weeks after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
For example , the myelin-deficient ( MD ) rat , which carries a point mutation in the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene , exhibits ataxia , tremor , dysmyelination and <termsem="GO:0016265"> dies </term> at approximately postnatal day 21 .
In MD rat , early <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> is caused by the dysfunction of the brain stem which is essential for <termsem="GO:0002087"> autonomic <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of respiration </term> during hypoxia [ 24 ] .
Further study is needed to verify the cause of <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in ADAM22-deficient mice .
Another interesting phenotype observed in ADAM22-deficient mice was hypomyelinogenesis .
Histopathological analysis revealed marked hypomyelination in the sciatic and trigeminal nerves .
However , <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> in the spinal cord and the brain was normal .
It was therefore evident that hypomyelinogenesis occurred specifically in the peripheral nerves in the knockout mice , suggesting Schwann cell dysfunction .
In the mutant sciatic nerve , the density of <termsem="GO:0031643"> pro- <termsem="GO:0042552"> myelinating </term> </term> Schwann cells ( S100-positive , MBP-negative ) was markedly higher than that seen in heterozygotes .
Higher <termsem="GO:0031643"> pro- <termsem="GO:0042552"> myelinating </term> </term> Schwann cell density and marked delay in <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> indicate that ADAM22 plays an important role in Schwann <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> , but not in proliferation .
Investigations on why hypomyelinogenesis occurred in ADAM22-deficient mice centre on integrin .
This is because several ADAMs have been shown to interact with integrins via disintegrin domains [ 9 ] , and it has been suggested that alpha-6 beta-1 integrin on the Schwann cell plays an important role in <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> [ 25 ] .
In addition , laminin-2 is a key player in <termsem="GO:0032290"> peripheral myelin formation </term> , because laminin-2 deficiency causes dysmyelination in mice and humans , and its <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> , alpha-6 beta-1 integrin and dystroglycan , are also shown to be deeply involved in <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> [ 26,27 ] .
The conditional knockout studies of beta-1 integrin and laminin gamma-1 in Schwann cell suggested that both laminin-2 and integrins are essential for segregation of large bundles of axons in the early stage of <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> [ 25,28 ] .
In contrast , the phenotype seen in the ADAM22-deficient mice was quite different : for example , unsorted bundles of axons were not seen in nerves and roots .
We assume that ADAM22 partially <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulates </term> integrin-mediated signals or is involved at a later stage of <termsem="GO:0032288"> myelin formation </term> .
In summary , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> ADAM22-deficient mice and proved that ADAM22 plays an essential role in both the CNS and the PNS .
The results of this study suggest that ADAM22 is involved in human diseases such as epilepsy and peripheral neuropathy .
The human ADAM22 gene is relatively large , at 300 kb in length , and is comprised of more than 30 exons .
It is assigned on 7q21 , where several chromosomal aberrations that are accompanied by neurological disorders have been identified [ 29,30 ] .
Further detailed molecular function analysis of ADAM22 may lead to progress in uncovering the mechanisms that underlie certain human neurological diseases .
<termsem="GO:0009058"> Construction </term> of an Adam22 gene-targeting vector .
The 18-kb genomic DNA fragments covering exons 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 of the Adam22 gene were amplified from C57BL/6 genomic DNA by PCR using Expand Hi-Fidelity enzyme mix ( Roche Diagnostics ) and primers designed for each exon .
To generate a mutation in the mouse Adam22 gene , we inserted the PGKneo cassette into exon 8 of the Adam22 gene .
The final targeting construct consisted of a 10.5-kb genomic DNA fragment that was interrupted by the insertion of the PGKneo cassette and contained a MC1 / <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> cassette as a negative selection marker against random integration [ 5 ] .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of Adam22 deficient mice .
The linearised targeting vector was electroporated into TT2 embryonic stem ( ES ) cells [ 31 ] .
Homologous recombinants were selected by PCR .
The extracted genomic DNA from each clone was amplified using the forward primer AGN2 : 5 ' - GCCTGCTTGCCGAATATCATGGTGGAAAAT-3 ' in the PGKneo cassette , and the reverse primer MFP065R : 5 ' - ACTATTTCTGTGATGAGGGCACAGCATC-3 ' outside the targeting vector .
Homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> DNA was efficiently amplified by 35 cycles of the following amplification steps ( 94 C -30 s and 68 C -5 min ) .
The targeting efficiency of this construct was about 4 % .
Correctly targeted ES clones were injected into <termsem="GO:0009566"> fertilized </term> ICR mouse eggs at the eight-cell stage .
The resulting male chimeras were <termsem="GO:0007618"> mated </term> with C57BL/6N females , and heterozygous male and female mice were <termsem="GO:0007618"> interbred </term> to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> homozygous mice .
The ataxic phenotypes of homozygous mice were observed in two independent lines .
Mouse genomic DNA used for Southern blot analysis was extracted from the liver of each genotype .
BamHI - <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> genomic DNA was probed with the [ 32P ] - labelled 0.4-kb SpeI-BamHI genomic fragment , which is located between exons 8 and 9 .
<termsem="GO:0002377"> <termsem="GO:0002378"> Antibody production </term> </term> .
His-tagged and MBP-fused <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> protein containing cytoplasmic domain ( cp ) of human ADAM22 isoform 1 ( position : 756 -- 906 , 151 amino acids in length ) were <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> in E. coli .
His-tagged ADAM22-cp protein was purified in <termsem="GO:0030164"> denatured </term> condition using Ni-NTA resin ( Qiagen GmbH ) and dialysed in PBS .
Precipitated protein was recovered and was mixed with Freund 's complete adjuvant ( Invitrogen ) , then , the mixture was used for immunization of rabbits .
The antiserum raised against the His-tagged ADAM22-cp protein was incubated with MBP-fused ADAM22-cp protein coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads ( Bio-Rad ) .
Beads with <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> antibodies were washed in PBS , and the <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> antibodies were eluted with 100 mM glycine , pH 3.0 , and neutralized immediately .
Using the affinity purified antibody , both human and mouse ADAM22 proteins were detected by Western blot analysis .
However , unfortunately the antibody was not suitable for immunohistochemical analysis of mouse tissues .
The absence of ADAM22 protein in the Adam22 - / - mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis .
Briefly , the cerebellum was isolated from a P14 .5 mouse of each genotype and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in <termsem="GO:0019835"> cell lysis </term> buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % NP-40 , Complete <termsem="GO:0030414"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> inhibitors </term> </term> [ Roche Diagnostics ] ) .
After removal of cell debris by centrifugation , the supernatant was separated on 10 % SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
The blot was then incubated with polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM22 ( at 1:1,000 ) .
<termsem="GO:0005488"> Bound </term> antibodies were visualized with horseradish <termsem="GO:0004601"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> peroxidase </term> </term> - labelled second antibody and a ECL-plus chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Biosciences Corp. ) .
Primary Schwann cell culture .
Primary Schwann cells were prepared from 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice according to Manent 's protocol [ 32 ] with minor modifications .
Briefly , sciatic nerves were removed and incubated for 7 days in the pre-treatment medium , which consisted of D-MEM ( high glucose ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 50 mg/ml gentamicin ( Invitrogen Corp. ) , 2.5 g/ml fungizone ( Invitrogen Corp. ) , 2 M forskolin ( EMD Biosciences Inc. ) and 10 ng/ml <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> heregulin-beta1 ( R&D Systems ) .
For dissociation , cultured sciatic nerves were cut into pieces and incubated at 37 C for 3 hours in Opti-MEM medium ( Invitrogen Corp. ) containing 130 U/ml <termsem="GO:0051405"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> collagenase type I </term> </term> ( Invitrogen Corp. ) and 0.4 U/ml dispase II ( Roche Diagnostics ) .
Dissociated cells were resuspended in the pre-treatment medium and plated on Poly-D-Lysine/Laminin coated plate ( BD Biosciences ) .
The purity of the cultured Schwann cells , as determined by indirect immunofluorescence analysis , approached 90 % .

Targeted mutation of Adam22 .
( A ) The genomic structure of the wild-type Adam22 allele ( top ) , the targeting construct ( middle ) and the disrupted allele ( bottom ) are shown .
ADAM22 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was disrupted by the insertion of a <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> termination </term> </term> codon and a PGKneo cassette into exon 8 .
An MC1 / <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> cassette at the end of the targeting vector allows for negative selection .
The 3 ' probe represents the position of the external probe used for Southern blot analysis , and expected BamHI [ B ] fragments are indicated by arrows .
