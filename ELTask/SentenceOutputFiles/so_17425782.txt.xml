Pygo1 and Pygo2 roles in Wnt signaling in mammalian kidney development .
The pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of Drosophila encodes an essential component of the Armadillo ( -catenin ) transcription factor complex of canonical Wnt signaling .
To better understand the functions of Pygopus-mediated canonical Wnt signaling in kidney development , targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> were made in the two mammalian <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> , Pygo1 and Pygo2 .
Each <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> > 80 % of the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> , including the critical PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , and almost certainly resulted in null function .
Pygo2 homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , with rare exception , died shortly after birth , with a phenotype including lens agenesis , growth retardation , altered kidney development , and in some cases exencephaly and cleft palate .
Pygo1 homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , however , were viable and fertile , with no detectable developmental defects .
Double Pygo1/Pygo2 homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> showed no apparent synergy in phenotype severity .
The BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter of canonical Wnt signaling showed reduced levels of expression in Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , with tissue-specific variation in degree of diminution .
The Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> both showed widespread expression in the developing kidney , with raised levels in the stromal cell compartment .
Confocal analysis of the double <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys showed disturbance of both the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme-derived compartments .
Branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud was altered , with expanded tips and reduced tip density , probably contributing to the smaller size of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidney .
In addition , there was an expansion of the zone of condensed mesenchyme capping the ureteric bud .
Nephron formation , however , proceeded normally .
Microarray analysis showed changed expression of several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , including Cxcl13 , Slc5a2 , Klk5 , Ren2 and Timeless , which represent candidate Wnt targets in kidney development .
The mammalian Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud during kidney development .
Nevertheless , the relatively mild phenotype observed in the kidney , as well as other organ systems , indicates a striking evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between mammals and Drosophila .
In mammals , the Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are not absolutely required for canonical Wnt signaling in most developing systems , but rather function as quantitative transducers , or modulators , of Wnt signal intensity .
Wnt signaling is of critical importance in several stages of kidney development .
Mutual inductive interactions between the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme drive nephrogenesis [ 1 ] .
The ureteric bud synthesizes Wnt9b , which is essential for induction of the mesenchyme to form nephrons [ 2 ] .
Wnt4 is made by the induced metanephric mesenchyme and is also required for nephrogenesis [ 3 ] .
Furthermore , Wnt11 , secreted by the ureteric bud tips , participates in a positive feedback loop promoting glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ( GDNF ) expression by the metanephric mesenchyme [ 4 ] .
<termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutations </term> in Wnt9b or Wnt4 result in a dramatic block in nephron formation , while Wnt11 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> show a significant reduction in nephron number .
It is interesting to note that Wnt4 and Wnt11 have been shown to signal , at least in some cases , through noncanonical pathways [ 5-7 ] , while there is evidence indicating that Wnt9b activates canonical Wnt signaling in the kidney [ 2 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genetic </term> studies in Drosophila have identified the Pygopus ( Pygo ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> as a critical component of canonical Wnt signaling [ 8-11 ] .
Pygo and Lgs interact with -catenin during the formation of the canonical transcriptional complex and are required for accumulation of -catenin in the nucleus [ 12 ] .
Lgs binds the central armadillo <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of -catenin , while Pygo interacts with Lgs , mediating activation of Wnt targets [ 9,13 ] .
The <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> </term> of Pygo is required for Wnt transcriptional activation , while the PHD motif is required for the association of Pygo with Lgs [ 9,13 ] .
Additionally , a putative nuclear localization <termsem="SO:0000418"> <termsem="SO:0000725"> signal </term> </term> ( NLS ) was identified within the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> </term> of Pygo , suggesting a possible role of nuclear importation of -catenin [ 8,11 ] .
Analyses of multiple aspects of the pygopus <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> phenotype indicate that this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is dedicated to , and required for , canonical Wnt signaling during Drosophila development [ 9 ] .
The mammalian <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> carries two , and only two , <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> of Drosophila Pygo , Pygo1 and Pygo2 [ 8,9,14 ] .
In this report , we generated targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> of Pygo1 and Pygo2 to determine their functions , with a particular interest in the contributions of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> to canonical Wnt signaling during kidney development .
The resulting double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos showed a context-dependent reduction in canonical Wnt signaling as measured by Wnt reporter <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> expression .
Development remained , however , surprisingly normal , with survival to birth and few apparent defects in most organ systems .
Our phenotypic analysis focused on the kidney , which showed altered branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud , and expansion of the zone of condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud , yet relatively normal nephron formation , as measured by histology , confocal analysis , in situ hybridization and microarray analysis .
The obvious conclusion is that in mammals , unlike Drosophila , Pygopus-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is not absolutely necessary in most developing organ systems .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
We targeted both the Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserting </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> LoxP sequences </term> to flank critical <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding regions </term> including the PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
The resulting targeted mice were mated with <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> CMV-Cre mice [ 15 ] to drive germline <termsem="SO:0000346"> LoxP </term> recombination , resulting in the null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> that were used for this study .
PCR confirmed the <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of the bulk of the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequences </term> for both <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , including 89 % of <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> for Pygo1 and 87 % of <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> for Pygo2 .
Previous studies in Drosophila have shown that even a single missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> can eliminate Pygo function in Wnt signaling [ 8 ] .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> phenotypes .
Pygo1 homozygous null mice were viable and fertile with no developmental defects detectable .
This was surprising given the importance of the pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in Wnt signaling in Drosophila , and the reported expression during development of the mouse Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in , for example , the brain , limbs , kidney and branchial arches [ 14,16 ] ( Yu J , Valerius MT , McMahon AP , contribution to GUDMAP , ) .
The Pygo2 homozygous null mice survived to birth , but with rare exceptions , died shortly afterwards .
The gut , heart and limbs developed without detectable abnormality ( data not shown ) despite known requirements for Wnt signaling .
The Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> did , however , show growth retardation , lens agenesis and a kidney phenotype with high penetrance , exencephaly , and cleft palate with incomplete penetrance .
Double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Pygo1 and Pygo2 mice had a phenotype similar to that of single Pygo2 nulls ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) .
There was no significant synergism of developmental abnormalities in the double <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Together these results suggest that Pygo2 is required for the proper development of a limited number of structures , whereas Pygo1 is not necessary for normal development .

Expression of Pygo1 and Pygo2 in the developing kidney .
In situ hybridization has been used previously to characterize expression of Pygo1 [ 14,16 ] ( Yu J , Valerius MT , McMahon AP , contribution to GUDMAP , ) .
In this report , we used immunofluorescence to better define the expression patterns of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the developing kidney .
Both <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were widely expressed , showing nuclear localization of encoded proteins in the ureteric bud , capping mesenchyme , and stromal cells ( Figure 2 ) .
Raised expression of Pygo1 , and to a lesser degree of Pygo2 , was seen in stromal cells , and significant nuclear staining was detected in essentially all cells of the developing kidney for both proteins .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 expression in the E18 .5 developing kidney .
Immunofluorescence was used to determine expression patterns of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 proteins in the cortex of the E18 .5 kidney .
Both Pygo1 and Pygo2 ( red ) were localized in the nucleus , as expected .
Both <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> showed widespread expression , with signal detected in all components of the developing kidney , but with elevated levels in the stromal cell compartment ( arrows ) .
Epithelial cells , primarily ureteric bud in these sections , were labeled blue using E-cadherin antibody .
Original magnification  200 .
Confocal analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys .
Histological examination of Pygo2 null and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys did not reveal any abnormalities in nephrogenesis ( data not shown ) .
Confocal analysis was therefore performed to characterize renal development in E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys more precisely ( Figure 3 ) .
Wt1 ( red ) and Cited1 ( red ) antibodies both stain the capping metanephric mesenchyme around the ureteric bud tips [ 17 ] .
WT1 antibody also stains renal vesicles and glomerular anlage .
Antibodies to Cdh1 , also known as E-cadherin ( blue ) , were used to identify epithelial structures , including the branching ureteric bud and nascent nephrons of the developing kidney [ 18 ] .
Dolichos biflorus ( DBA ) lectin [ 16 ] was used to selectively stain ureteric bud-derived structures [ 19 ] .
Confocal analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> E18 .5 kidneys .
( B , D ) Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> E18 .5 kidneys and ( A , C ) kidneys of normal littermates were stained using antibodies to ( C , D ) Cited1 or ( A , B ) Wt1 , both expressed in the condensing metanephric mesenchyme , and colored as red , Cdh1 , a general marker of epithelia ( blue ) , and DBA lectin staining the ureteric tree [ 16 ] .
Confocal Z-sections were obtained every 5 m for 75 -- 80 m .
A reduced number of ureteric tips per area was observed in ( B , D ) the Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys compared with ( A , C ) control littermates .
In addition , ureteric bud tips were often more dilated in Pygo1/2 null <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> compared with controls .
The condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud was also significantly expanded in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Original magnification  200 .
Wt1 and Cited1 ( red ) staining revealed an increase of approximately 30 % in the thickness of the capping mesenchyme surrounding the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> ureteric buds ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ) .
Nevertheless , the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> metanephric mesenchyme underwent relatively normal nephrogenesis .
Cdh1-staining nephrons ( blue ) were identified connecting to the ureteric bud tips [ 16 ] and extending into the medulla of the kidney , as normal .
Intermediate structures of nephrogenesis , including renal vesicles , comma-shaped bodies , and S-shaped bodies appeared normal .

SD , Standard deviation ; n , number .
Confocal analysis also showed that the ureteric bud tips [ 16 ] of Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys were dilated and misshaped compared with those of littermates with at least one <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( Figure 3 ) .
In addition , the Pygo1/Pygo2 double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys also had a decrease of approximately 25 % in the number of ureteric bud tips per area compared with littermates with at least one <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> copy of Pygo2 ( Table 2 ) .
No significant difference in ureteric bud-tip density was seen between Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> embryos ( P = 0.33 ) .
We examined expression of three Wnt <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in Pygo <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Wnt7b is expressed in the stalks [ 20 ] , Wnt11 in the tips [ 4 ] , and Wnt9b in the stalks and weakly in the tips of the branching ureteric bud [ 2 ] .
All three <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> showed similar expression patterns in Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> and Pygo1/Pygo2 double - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys ( Figure 4 ) .
In addition , these in situ hybridization patterns confirmed the confocal microscopy results , showing a reduced number of tips ( Wnt11-positive ) per surface area in the Pygo1/Pygo2 double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .

The <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys showed normal expression patterns for the ureteric stalk markers Wnt7b and Wnt9b , and reduced density of ureteric tips as measured by Wnt11 .

Reduced canonical Wnt signaling in Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
The BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter of canonical Wnt signaling [ 21 ] was used to examine changes in Wnt signaling in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
Both Pygo2 - / - and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null E10 .5 embryos showed a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling ( Figure 5 ) .
There was , however , tissue-specific variability in the degree of reduction , with the somites , for example , showing strong reduction , while the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> telencephalon still showed robust Wnt signaling .
These results suggest that the mammalian Pygo <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are significant modulators of canonical Wnt signaling in some , but not in all developing systems .

( D ) Double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - embryos still showed some remaining BAT-gal expression , suggesting residual canonical Wnt signaling .

We also examined BAT-gal reporter expression in more detail in the developing urogenital system of Pygo <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
The results suggested that the Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is required for canonical Wnt signaling in the nephric duct .
Both Pygo2 null and Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null E10 .5 embryos showed an absence of reporter expression in the nephric duct , while control littermates showed strong expression ( Figure 6A -- C ) .
In Pygo1/Pygo2 double-null <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , the nephric duct did form , however , and give rise to the ureteric bud outgrowth , which showed reduced but not absent BAT-gal reporter expression ( Figure 6A -- C ) .
Pygo2 is required for BAT-gal reporter expression in ureteric bud-derived structures of the developing kidney .

( K , L ) Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - , reporter activity was lost in the paramesonephric duct ( white arrowhead ) , and in the ureter and ureteric compartment of the developing kidneys ( dashed circles ) , except for ( K ) a few faintly staining cells .

At E13 .5 , the Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> appeared to play a major role , and the Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> a minor role , in canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric tree , as measured by BAT-gal expression .
A negative control kidney , without the BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> , showed minimal background X-gal staining ( Figure 6D ) , whereas a BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> kidney with at least one <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> showed strong X-gal staining in the ureteric tree ( Figure 6E ) .
In contrast , Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 - / - E13 .5 kidneys showed very weak reporter expression ( Figure 6F ) , suggesting a significant loss of canonical Wnt signaling .
Homozygous <termsem="SO:0000045"> loss </term> of the Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> alone , however , had a small effect on reporter expression ( Figure 6G -- H ) .
Homozygous <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of both the Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> gave a more dramatic reduction of BAT-gal expression than loss of Pygo2 alone ( Figure 6F , L ) .
The Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were also required for BAT-gal reporter expression in the paramesonephric ( Mullerian ) ducts .
In Pygo2 - / - mice , there was a significant loss of reporter expression ( data not shown ) , and double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> showed loss of X-gal staining in the paramesonephric ducts ( Figure 6K ) , whereas Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - and Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - mice showed normal levels of BAT-gal expression ( Figure 6G , H , J ) .
BAT-gal reporter analysis of the Pygo <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> at a later developmental stage , E18 .5 , also identified a significant decrease in canonical Wnt signaling in the cortical ureteric branches and renal pelvis of the developing kidney ( Figure 6M -- O ) .
Cortical X-gal staining was seen in the ureteric branches of a Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - kidney ( Figure 6M , left ) , but was completely absent in the cortex of a Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 - / - kidney ( Figure 6M , right ) .
Bisection revealed a significant loss of X-gal staining cells in the collecting ducts and renal pelvis of the Pygo2 null kidney compared with control littermates ( Figure 6N ) .
Side by side comparison of Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ( Figure 6O , left ) , Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ( Figure 6O , middle ) , and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - ( Figure 6O , right ) E18 .5 kidneys suggested a significant role for the Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric tree and its derivatives .
In order to validate and quantify the BAT-gal reporter expression changes in the Pygo2 null and Pygo1/Pygo2 nulls , we performed ELISA measurements of <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> specific -galactosidase levels in E18 .5 kidneys ( Figure 7 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000045"> Loss </term> of the Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 - / - and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - ) gave greater than 90 % reduction in BAT-gal expression .
<termsem="SO:0000045"> Loss </term> of Pygo1 alone ( Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) did not result in a significant change .
Interestingly , however , the Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - showed only 50 % of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> BAT-gal expression , suggesting a minor contribution by Pygo1 in canonical Wnt signaling .
Although BAT-gal expression was decreased in the E18 .5 Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - kidney , confocal analysis of kidneys with this <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> revealed no dilated ureteric tips or significant changes in ureteric tip number per area compared with Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> kidneys ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , these BAT-gal reporter results suggest a significant role for the Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in canonical Wnt signaling during development of the ureteric tree of the kidney .
Quantitative analysis of BAT-gal reporter expression in Pygo1/Pygo2 E18 .5 kidney extracts .
<termsem="SO:0000902"> Transgene </term> - specific beta-galactosidase was quantified by ELISA analysis .
Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> , Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - and Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - / Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> kidneys all showed similar levels of BAT-gal expression .
In the Pygo2 hetereozygote , Pygo1 homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , however , reporter expression was reduced by about 50 % .
In Pygo2 homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> BAT-gal expression was uniformly low , with or without <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
Each experimental group included a sample size of at least four .
Interestingly , however , even in <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice the BAT-gal reporter showed no expression in the developing metanephric mesenchyme , or metanephric mesenchyme-derived structures , such as renal vesicles , S-shaped bodies , tubules , and glomeruli .
This has been reported previously , and was interpreted to indicate the absence of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme [ 21 ] .
Results from other studies , however , argue for the presence of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme .
For example , ureteric bud expression of Wnt1 , thought to act through canonical Wnt signaling , can rescue Wnt9b <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> and induce nephrogenesis of the metanephric mesenchyme [ 2 ] .
This suggests that the BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> might not accurately report canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme .
To address this question , we incubated E11 .5 metanephric mesenchyme in lithium chloride ( LiCl ) , which activates canonical Wnt signaling through inhibition of GSK3 , and also functions as an inducer of nephrogenesis in kidney organ culture [ 22 ] .
We observed that LiCl-treated metanephric mesenchyme did undergo nephrogenesis , as expected , but failed to show BAT-gal expression ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> is not an accurate reporter of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme of the developing kidney .
Microarray analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys .
To further examine possible disturbance of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression in the Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys , we used microarrays to perform a global analysis of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression changes .
Whereas the BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter monitors the response of one <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> to Wnt signaling , microarrays can be used to follow expression changes of all <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , including all <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> Wnt targets .
E18 .5 <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - kidneys were examined in biological triplicate .
In total , 45 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified as significantly changed , using a relatively low stringency screen of the data , with a p-value cutoff of < 0.05 , and fold change > 2 ( Table 3 ) .
Notably , both Pygo1 and Pygo2 were identified as downregulated ( - 5.3-fold and - 3.9-fold , respectively ) in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys .
Other <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with significant decreases in <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys included Cxcl13 ( - 2.3-fold ) , Slc5a2 ( - 2.8-fold ) , and Slco1a4 ( - 2.1-fold ) .
Slc5a2 is expressed in the proximal tubules of the adult nephron and has been implicated in autosomal recessive renal glucosuria , characterized by loss of glucose uptake by the nephron [ 23 ] .
The organic anion transporter , Slco1a4 , is also strongly expressed in the tubules of the adult kidney [ 24 ] .
These results suggest that the Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> might play a role in nephron maturation and subsequent function .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genes </term> differentially expressed ( p < 0.05 , two-fold change or greater ) in the Pygo1/Pygo2 null E18 .5 kidney normalized to <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> samples .
Noteworthy <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> upregulated in the Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidney included Klk5 ( 2.8-fold ) , Klk6 ( 2.7-fold ) , Ren2 ( 2.2-fold ) , and Timeless ( 2.4-fold ) .
Klk5 and Klk6 are members of the kallikrein family of trypsin-like <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> proteases .
Kallikreins have diverse functions in cancer , tissue remodeling , and regulation of blood pressure [ 25 ] .
Ren2 , a <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> of the endopeptidase Renin 1 , activates the renin-angiotensin system , increasing blood pressure [ 26 ] .
Disruption of the renin-angiotensin system during development results in congenital abnormalities of the ureter and collecting-duct system [ 27 ] .
Timeless , a transcription factor involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms , and expressed in the branching ureteric tips , has also been shown to regulate ureteric branching morphogenesis [ 28 ] .
We were interested in the possible altered expression of previously <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> Wnt targets in the Pygo1 - / - / Pygo2 - / - <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys .
A list of <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> Wnt targets was compiled from .
Both Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets were included as references to illustrate significant down regulation .
Remarkably , the <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> Wnt target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> showed very few differences in expression between <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys ( Figure 8 ) .
Only the expression of Ccnd1 encoding cyclin D1 [ 29 ] , and Wisp1 [ 30 ] were significantly changed , with expression level changes of < 1.5-fold in Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys .
These results indicate an absence of dramatic changes in expression of previously <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> Wnt signaling target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> expression changes of common Wnt signaling targets in the E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidney .
Microarray analysis was performed in triplicate on <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and Pygo1/2 compound null E18 .5 kidneys .
Possible Wnt targets were selected from those compiled at [ 39 ] .
An initial <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> list of 82 Wnt targets was created and then reduced to a total of 40 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> using an expression level restriction requiring the raw expression intensity to be > 100 in at least 3 samples .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> were included to demonstrate significant changes in expression levels .
We used quantitative real-time PCR , with independent biological samples , to validate the microarray results .
Nine <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were tested , and for seven we did observe a significant fold change in the same direction predicted by the microarray results ( Table 4 ) .
It is not surprising that two of the nine <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> could not be validated , considering the relatively low stringency used in screening the microarray data .
Validation of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression changes in the E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null kidneys normalized to E18 .5 <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> kidneys .
In Drosophila , the Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is a key mediator of canonical Wnt signaling .
In one study , 12 distinct measures of Wnt signaling in Pygo <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> were performed , including analysis of leg , wing , and eye imaginal discs .
In 2 cases there was a significant reduction of Wnt signaling and in 10 cases a complete block [ 10 ] .
A second study in Drosophila examined the effects of Pygo <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> on cuticle patterning , midgut constriction , central nervous system , and cardiac development , and concluded that `` Pygo is an essential component in the Wg signal transduction pathway '' .
[ 8 ] .
Given these results in Drosophila , the relatively mild phenotypes of mice with targeted Pygo1 , Pygo2 , or double Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> were striking .
Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> developed to birth and showed limited abnormalities , while Pygo1 homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> were normal and fertile .
Furthermore , there was no detected synergism in the phenotype of the double Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> , although in several tissues the BAT-gal Wnt reporter did show more a severe reduction in expression .
One possible explanation of these unexpected results is a failure of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting to eliminate functioning of the Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
The Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> described in this report , however , are almost certainly functional nulls .
In Drosophila , it has been shown that the PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> is absolutely necessary for Pygopus function in Wg signaling .
The PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> is 60 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> with seven <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteines </term> and a <termsem="SO:0001452"> histidine </term> , predicted to chelate two zinc ions .
PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> are found in diverse proteins , including transcription factors , and have been implicated in chromatin remodeling and protein-protein interactions [ 8 ] .
In Drosophila the pygoF107 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , with a single missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> <termsem="SO:0000041"> converting </term> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> 802 in the PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> from <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> to <termsem="SO:0001446"> tyrosine </term> , loses Wnt signaling function in both embryogenesis and imaginal disc development [ 8 ] .
The Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> made in this report carried <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletions </term> of the entire PHD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> , as well as most other <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequences </term> .
For the Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , the <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding region </term> for 372 of 417 total <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> was <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> , and for the Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , we <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding </term> for 354 of 405 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> .
It is therefore very unlikely that the relatively mild phenotypes observed were the result of residual function of the targeted <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
We focused our analysis on the developing kidney , in which Wnt signaling has been shown to be of critical importance in several stages of nephrogenesis .
Wnt9b is made by the ureteric bud and induces the metanephric mesenchyme to undergo nephrogenesis [ 2 ] .
Downstream of Wnt9b is Wnt4 [ 2 ] , which is made by the metanephric mesenchyme , and is also required for nephrogenesis [ 3 ] .
In addition , Wnt11 is produced by the ureteric bud tips and induces GDNF expression in the metanephric mesenchyme [ 4 ] .
In this report we describe a novel Wnt function in kidney development .
The BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter indicated the presence of canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric bud and its derivatives in the developing kidney .
Further , in the Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> this signal was lost , suggesting significant reduction of Wnt signaling .
In addition , we observed a resulting decrease in ureteric tip density , reduced kidney size and altered morphology of the ureteric tree in <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , indicating a role for canonical Wnt signaling in branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud .
While the simplest interpretation is direct Wnt signaling to the ureteric bud , it remains possible that the observed abnormalities are the result of indirect effects , with altered Wnt signaling to the metanephric mesenchyme then affecting mesenchyme to ureteric bud signaling .
The Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> phenotype of reduced branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud is surprisingly similar to that previously reported for Wnt11 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> [ 4 ] .
The underlying mechanisms , however , are likely to be distinct .
Wnt11 is generally thought to act through a noncanonical pathway , ( although exceptions have been noted [ 31 ] ) , whereas the Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> promote canonical Wnt signaling .
Further , the Wnt11 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> showed an altered feedback loop between Wnt signaling from the ureteric bud to the mesenchyme and GDNF signaling from the mesenchyme to the bud , whereas in the Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> , we observed disrupted Wnt signaling in the ureteric bud .
The Pygo1/2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> also showed an expansion of the zone of thickened mesenchyme that caps the ureteric bud .
Nevertheless , the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> metanephric mesenchyme formed nephrons normally .
This was particularly interesting , as Wnt9b signaling from the ureteric bud to the metanephric mesenchyme has been shown to induce nephrogenesis via canonical Wnt signaling [ 2 ] .
The results in this report indicate a striking and surprising evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between Drosophila and mammals .
In Drosophila , the Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is often required for canonical Wnt signaling , while in mammals the Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> appear to play a smaller role in canonical Wnt signaling .
The BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter of canonical Wnt signaling showed reduced but generally not absent signal in Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos , with tissue-specific variation in level of diminution .
In addition , the kidneys were not unique in showing surprisingly normal development in Pygo1/Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Indeed , organogenesis generally proceeded without detectable abnormality , with few exceptions .
These results suggest that the proteins encoded by mammalian Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are often mere modulators of canonical Wnt signaling intensity , and not essential components .
The microarray results further support this conclusion .
Whereas the BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter monitors the expression level of only one Wnt responsive <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> , the microarray allows the analysis of the activity levels of <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoters </term> of all <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Interestingly , the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> kidneys showed <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - expression profiles surprisingly similar to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild type </term> </term> .
Some <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> did , however , show expression differences , and a high percentage of these differences could be validated by real-time PCR with independent biological samples .
Assuming that the Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in mammals are dedicated to canonical Wnt signaling , as has been previously shown in Drosophila , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with expression differences represent candidate Wnt targets ( direct or indirect ) in kidney development .
We would predict these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> to show greater changes in expression level in a developing kidney with a more complete removal of canonical Wnt signaling .
In conclusion , the mammalian Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud , with <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> showing dilated tips and reduced numbers of tips .
In addition , in Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> there was an expansion of the zone of metanephric mesenchyme that caps the ureteric buds .
Nevertheless , nephron formation proceeded remarkably normally , even in Pygo1/Pygo2 double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
This was surprising considering the importance of the Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in canonical Wnt signaling in Drosophila , and the importance of canonical Wnt signaling in nephrogenesis .
The results argue that the mammalian Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are , in most developing systems , only quantitative transducers of Wnt signaling .
Previous cell culture studies [ 32,33 ] and the reduced BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter expression in the Pygo1/Pygo2 knockout mice described in this report , do confirm an evolutionarily conserved function in canonical Wnt signaling .
In mammals , however , the phenotypic effects of Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> are much milder than in Drosophila .
The degree of importance of the Pyg1/2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in Wnt signaling was context-dependent , but in general , mammalian organogenesis remained intact in Pygopus <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Perhaps the simplest explanation is that in mammals , other <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> show partial functional redundancy with the two Pygopus <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
The -catenin transcription-factor complex includes a large and growing number of proteins , some of which may share the nuclear localization and/or transcription activation functions of Pygo1/Pygo2 in mammals .
The identities and roles of these Pygopus redundant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> remain to be determined .
Targeting of Pygo1 and Pygo2 .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were each targeted by flanking the critical <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding regions </term> of the third <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> containing the PHD motif with <termsem="SO:0000346"> LoxP sequences </term> .
Targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> were made using the Flp/Cre <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> previously described [ 34 ] , which carries a neomycin-resistance <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by <termsem="SO:0000350"> FRT sequences </term> , and three unique <termsem="SO:0000061"> restriction sites </term> for subcloning the two blocks of homology for driving recombination , and the critical <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> to be <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by <termsem="SO:0000346"> LoxP sequences </term> .
For each <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , the three <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> segments </term> required for subcloning were made by PCR from RI ES cell <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
The resulting targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> were confirmed by sequencing .
For Pygo1 , the <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequences </term> used for PCR were : 5 ' <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> , GTGAAGGAGAGATGGATAAGTATG ; 5 ' <termsem="SO:0001031"> back </term> , TAGACCCTAACCACCTACAAG ; <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> , GGTTAGGGTCTATGTGCTGG ; <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> <termsem="SO:0001031"> back </term> , TCACCAAATCTCTGTTCTACAC ; 3 ' <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> , TGTGTAGAACAGAGATTTGGTG ; 3 ' <termsem="SO:0001031"> back </term> , CAGTGAAGAAAGAGGGTCAG .
For Pygo2 , the <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequences </term> used for PCR were : GCCTGGGTTGCTTGTCTTCTG and CCACCTTACTTGTGTGTGAGGATACATAC , CCAAGTCCCAGCATCTCTTAC and CCAGTCATACCAGCAACAAG , and <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon sequences </term> TGGGTGCTGGGAACAGAAC and CAACAACAACAGAAGACAAGC .
Linearized <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> were electroporated into RI ES cells , and resulting targeted ES cells used for C57/Bl6 blastocyst injections according to standard protocols .
Resulting chimeras were mated with Swiss Black mice , and the targeted stocks maintained on a mixed 129/Swiss Black background .
Germline null <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of both Pygo1 and Pygo2 were generated by mating heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> mice with the CMV-Cre mice [ 15 ] .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> used for genotyping PCR were : Pygo2 null <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> ( <termsem="SO:0001030"> F </term> ) CCTGGATTCTTGTTGCTGGTATG ; <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> ( <termsem="SO:0001031"> R </term> ) AAGGTATTTGGTGCTCCGAGGG ; Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> or <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , <termsem="SO:0001030"> F </term> TGTCTTGATGACAGCGTTTAGCC , <termsem="SO:0001031"> R </term> AGATTCAGTAAGCTGAGCCTGGTG ; Pygo1 null <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , <termsem="SO:0001030"> F </term> AGTTTGAAATAGCGACGAGTTTGAG , <termsem="SO:0001031"> R </term> 5 ' - CACTTCTGCCCCTCTCTTTGC ; Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> or <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , <termsem="SO:0001030"> F </term> AAGCGTGCCTCATCTCCATCCCTAAG , <termsem="SO:0001031"> R </term> GCCCTCCCCGACGTTTATATTG .
The noon of the day that vaginal plugs were observed was designated E0 .5 .
Kidneys were dissected , fixed in paraformaldehyde , treated with methanol , and washed with PBS containing Tween-20 ( PBS-T ) prior to treatment with lectins and antibodies .
PBS-T was used for incubations of the tissues with fluoroscein-conjugated Dilichos biflorus aggutinin ( DBA , Vector ; Burlingame , USA ) , and PBS-T plus 2 % goat serum was used for incubations with the antibodies .
The primary antibodies were anti-WT1 ( c-19 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , anti-uvomorulin ( e-cadherin , Cdh1 , Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis , MO , USA ) , and anti-Cited1 ( Neomarkers-Lab Vision Corporation , Fremont , CA , USA ) .
The secondary antibodies were Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa 633-conjugated anti-rat antibodies ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) .
The tissues were imaged with a laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , New York , USA ) equipped with an argon ( 488 nm ) and two HeNe lasers ( 543 nm and 633 nm ) .
Optical sections approximately 2 m thick were obtained every 5 m to a depth of at least 65 m .
The sections began at the surface of the kidney and were on a plane tangential to it .
Two Z-stack series were obtained , one from each of the two kidneys of each embryo .
Ureteric bud tips identified by section tracing were counted within a defined area of the confocal image .
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [ 35 ] .
Riboprobes to Wnt11 and Wnt7b were described previously [ 35 ] .
The Wnt9b riboprobe was provided by T. Carroll [ 2 ] .
Pygo1 and Pygo2 antibody production .
To generate anti-human Pygo2 ( anti-hPygo2 ) and anti-mouse Pygo1 ( anti-mPygo1 ) polyclonal antibodies , we subcloned <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> by PCR corresponding to <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino-acid residues </term> 80 -- 327 of human Pygo 2 or <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino-acid residues </term> 76 -- 263 of mouse Pygo1 into pGEX4T1 ( Amersham Health , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) .
The PCR <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> of hPygo 2 and mPygo 1 lack both NHD and PHD <termsem="SO:0000330"> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> regions </term> of hPygo2 and mPygo1 .
GST-hPygo2 and GST-mPygo1 proteins were expressed in bacteria , purified , and injected into rabbits for antibody production by ( Proteintech Group Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
The rabbit antisera of anti-mPygo1 and anti-hPygo2 were initially allowed to bind to the GST affinity matrix to remove any antibodies against GST .
The anti-hPygo2 and anti-mPygo1 antisera were then separated from the GST affinity matrix and allowed to bind to the GST-hPygo2 or GST-mPygo1 affinity columns , respectively .
The bound antibodes were eluted with elution buffer .
To further ensure antibody specficity , the purified antibodies were extensively incubated with Pygo1/2 double-homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryo extract before use .
BAT-gal <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> reporter assay of canonical Wnt signaling .
X-gal staining of both embryos and developing kidneys was performed as previously described [ 21 ] .
Care was taken to reduce endogenous -galactosidase activity within the developing kidney by increasing pH of the X-gal staining solution to 8.0 .
Changes in <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> -Gal expression were quantitated using a -Gal ELISA ( <termsem="SO:0001185"> Enzyme </term> - linked immunoassay ) kit ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) , normalizing according to total protein .
Each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> was represented by a sample size of 4 except the non - <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> ( n = 5 ) , Pygo1 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ; Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ( n = 6 ) , Pygo1 - / - ; Pygo2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ( n = 8 ) , and Pygo1 - / - ; Pygo2 - / - ( n = 6 ) groups .
Total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> was isolated from E18 .5 kidneys dissected from normal and Pygo1/Pygo2 compound null embryos using a commercial kit ( Stratagene Absolutely <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> Microprep Kit ; La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
An aliquot ( 300 ng ) of total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> was processed and labeled using a commercial kit ( TargetAmp 1-Round Aminoallyl-aRNA Ki ; Epicentre , Madison , WI , USA ) .
Labeled <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> was hybridized to microarrays ( Sentrix Mouse-6 expression Beadchip ; Illumina , San Diego , CA ) providing coverage of over 47000 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and <termsem="SO:0000345"> expressed sequence tags </term> as previously described [ 36 ] .
Microarray analysis of Pygo1/Pygo2 null and normal <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> kidneys was performed in biological triplicate .
Raw signal intensities of each <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> were obtained from data analysis software ( Beadstudio ; Illumina ) and imported into GeneSpring GX 7.3 ( Agilent Technologies , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genes </term> were selected on the basis of greater than two-fold average fold change and statistical significance ( p-value < 0.05 ) .
Previously described Wnt target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were obtained from .
Quantitative PCR validation of microarray results .
Total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> from E18 .5 Pygo1/Pygo2 null and control kidneys ( both represented in duplicate and distinct from the kidneys used for microrray analysis ) was purified using a commercial kit ( Absolutely <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> Microprep Kit ; Stratagene , La Jolla , CA USA ) including DNAse1 treatment .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was generated using <termsem="SO:0000449"> random </term> hexamers according to conventional protocols ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) .
The following <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> were generated to include the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> obtained from the Illumina <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> : Actb ( TTGCTGACAGGATGCAGAAG , ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC ) ; Aldh1a7 ( CCAGAAAGTGGTGTTTTGCT , GAGTTACAGAGAGCTTGCACCTT ) ; Col8a1 ( GCAGACAGGCATCTTCACCT , TGTGTACATCATGGGCTCGT ) ; Csrp1 ( CAGCATAGCCCAGGGTAGAG , TGGGCAAGGTAGTGAAGGTT ) ; Klk5 ( GCAGCATTACACCCGTCATA , TTGCCTCCATCCATATCTCC ) ; Picalm ( GGGAGGGAACAGAAATCCTT , GCACCGATCAACAGTGCAG ) ; Pygo2 ( TTCTGGGAACTTGTGCACTG , AACTTCCTCCAGCCCATTTT ) ; Ren2 ( TTGTGAGCTGTAGCCAGGTG , TGTGCACAGCTTGTCTCTCC ) and Tia1 ( TGATTGAAGGGCTACTAGAGTGGT , AGCCCCAGAGGACAATTTTT ) using Primer3 software [ 37 ] .
Relative quantitative PCR was performed according to the conventional SYBR Green protocol ( Stratagene ) using a quantitative PCR system ( Mx3000p ; Stratagene ) .
Dissociation curve and agarose-gel analysis of each <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> set were used to insure specificity of the amplicon .
All data were normalized to an internal housekeeping control ( Actb ) and analyzed using the 2 ( - Delta Delta C ( T ) ) method [ 38 ] .
