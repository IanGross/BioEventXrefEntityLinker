Structure-function evolution of the Transforming acidic coiled coil genes revealed by analysis of phylogenetically diverse <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> .
Examination of ancient gene families can provide an insight into how the evolution of gene structure can relate to function .
Functional homologs of the evolutionarily conserved transforming acidic coiled coil ( TACC ) gene family are present in <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> from <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> to <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> man </term> .
However , correlations between functional interactions and the evolution of these proteins have yet to be determined .
We have performed an extensive database analysis to determine the genomic and cDNA sequences of the TACCs from phylogenetically diverse <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> .
This analysis has determined the phylogenetic relationship of the TACC proteins to other coiled coil proteins , the resolution of the placement of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> TACC4 as the orthologue of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC3 , and RHAMM as a distinct family of coiled coil proteins .
We have also extended the analysis of the TACCs to the interaction databases of <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> to identify potentially novel TACC interactions .
The validity of this modeling was confirmed independently by the demonstration of direct binding of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC2 to the nuclear hormone receptor RXR .
The data so far suggest that the ancestral TACC protein played a role in centrosomal/mitotic spindle dynamics .
TACC proteins were then recruited to complexes involved in protein translation , RNA processing and transcription by interactions with specific bridging proteins .
However , during evolution , the TACC proteins have now acquired the ability to directly interact with components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins , nuclear hormone receptors , GAS41 , and transcription factors ) .
This suggests that the function of the TACC proteins may have evolved from performing assembly or coordination functions in the centrosome to include a more intimate role in the functional evolution of chromatin remodeling , transcriptional and posttranscriptional complexes in the cell .
The evolution of complex <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> has been associated with the generation of gene families by the continual duplication of an initial relatively small set of ancestral genes .
Through this process , followed by subsequent mutation , reduplication and exon shuffling between gene families , genes have evolved both discrete , and partially redundant functions with their related family members .
With the completion of the genome sequencing projects of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7215"> fruit fly </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:6231"> nematodes </term> , we are now in a position to ask fundamental questions in regard to how genes interact in the context of the whole <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organism </term> .
Thus , with the appropriate application of bioinformatics , it is now possible to trace the lineage of particular genes and gene families , with related gene families in other <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> .
Furthermore , with the growing amount of large-scale proteomic and genomic data becoming publicly available , this analysis can now be extended to reveal the complex interplay between evolution of gene structure and protein function .
The first Transforming acidic coiled coil gene , TACC1 , was identified during the development of an expression map of the proximal short arm of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 8 [ 1 ] .
Two additional TACC family members were subsequently identified and mapped to paralogous chromosomal regions on <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosomes 4p16 and 10q26 , physically close to members of the FGFR gene family [ 1-3 ] .
This mapping data , together with identification of a single TACC gene in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostomes </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Caenorhabitis elegans </term> </term> , and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Drosophila melanogaster </term> </term> [ 4-6 ] , led to the speculation that the ancestral FGFR and TACC genes were located physically close to each other .
Thus , during the evolution of <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> , subsequent successive duplications of the ancestral gene cluster have given rise to three TACC family members located close to FGFR genes in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> .
In accordance with the proposed quadruplication of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> genome during evolution , there is a fourth FGFR family member in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> , raising the question of whether a fourth TACC gene is associated with FGFR4 in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> genomes .
To date , only three active TACC genes have been cloned in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> [ 1-3 ] , one in each of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> [ 7 ] , <termsem="NCBITaxon:8355"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Xenopus laevis </term> </term> [ 8 ] , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> [ 4 ] , and <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> [ 5,6 ] .
Although two additional new candidate TACC family members , <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Oryctolagus cuniculus </term> </term> TACC4 [ 9 ] and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> RHAMM [ 10 ] have been proposed , their true identity and placement in the evolution of the TACC family is under debate .
Thus , the identification and functional characterization of new members of the TACC family in other <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> , alternatively spliced isoforms of each TACC and comparison of the phylogenetic relationship of these genes relative to other members of the coiled coil superfamily will resolve this issue and provide clues to the evolution of TACC function .
In silico identification of TACC family members from <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> and invertebrate lineages .
Sequence similarity searches of the publicly available genome databases with the BLAST and TBLAST programs were performed to identify TACC and RHAMM orthologues , and other members of the coiled coil superfamily in a diverse set of <termsem="species"> species </term> ( Fig. 1 ) .
This identified the complete sequence of the TACC genes in representatives of five major phylogenetically distinct clades .
Where possible , the construction of the TACC sequences from these <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> was also confirmed by the analysis of the cDNA databases .
Several partial sequences in other <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> <termsem="species"> species </term> , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7586"> echinodermate </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7668"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Strongylocentrotus purpuratus </term> </term> and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostome </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:50557"> insect </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7165"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Anopheles gambiae </term> </term> were also identified , suggesting an ancient conservation of the TACC genes in <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> metazoan </term> lineages .
However , due to the relative infancy of the cDNA/genome projects for these latter <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> , complete characterization of these TACC genes could not be undertaken .
No conclusion could be made about the existence of TACC-like sequence in non - <termsem="NCBITaxon:33213"> bilaterian </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> metazoans </term> , such as <termsem="NCBITaxon:6073"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Cnidaria </term> </term> or <termsem="NCBITaxon:6040"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Porifera </term> </term> , due to the paucity of sequence information for these <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> , and additional definitive sequences with a defined TACC domain could not be found in other non - <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> metazoan </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> .
Phylogenetic analysis of the TACC family members compared to other coiled coil proteins .
The phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the Methods section .
The TACC family defines a separate subfamily of coiled coil containing proteins , distinct from other coiled coil families such as the keratins , RHAMM and tropomyosins .
Note that the RHAMM proteins form a separate branch more closely related to the tropomyosins and kinesin like proteins ( KLP ) , than the TACC proteins .
At the base of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> branch of life , a single TACC gene was identified in the genome of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7712"> urochordate </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Ciona intestinalis </term> </term> [ 11 ] , and a partial TACC sequence from an analysis of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7729"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Halocynthia rortezi </term> </term> EST database [ 12 ] .
This confirms the original assumption that a single TACC gene was present in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> ancestor .
The next major event in the evolution of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> genome has been suggested to have occurred 687  155.7 million years ago ( MYA ) , with the first duplication of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> genome , and a second duplication occurring shortly thereafter .
Thus , if the TACC genes were duplicated at both events , we would expect to identify four TACC genes in the most `` primitive '' compact <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> genome sequenced to date , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Takifugu rubripes </term> </term> , with three genes corresponding to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC1-3 , and , in keeping with the proposed model for genomic duplication of the chromosomal loci for the TACC genes ( discussed below ) , a possible fourth gene deriving from the TACC3 ancestor .
Indeed , four TACC genes were identified in <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> .
Of these , two genes corresponded to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> orthologues of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC2 and TACC3 .
However , the other two genes , trTACC1A and trTACC1B are clearly most related to TACC1 ( Fig. 1 ) .
Although trTACC1A is highly homologous to trTACC1B , the latter encodes a significantly smaller predicted protein .
The trTACC1B gene is encoded by 15 exons over approximately 7 kb of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31032"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Takifugu </term> </term> Scaffold 191 ( see below ) .
A search of this region using the trTACC1A sequence and gene prediction software has so far failed to identify additional exons of trTACC1B .
However , given the intron/exon structure of this apparently complete gene , it appears likely that trTACC1B is active in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> , and presumably fulfils either a temporal-spatial specific function within the <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organism </term> , or a distinct function from the larger trTACC1A product within the cell .
Thus , based upon the surrounding chromosomal loci ( see below ) , the trTACC1A and trTACC1B genes appear to have arisen from the duplication of the chromosomal segment containing the <termsem="NCBITaxon:32443"> teleost </term> TACC1 ancestor , during the additional partial genomic duplication that occurred in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:32443"> teleost </term> lineage .
Therefore , this analysis of <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> does not support the hypothesis that the region surrounding the TACC3 ancestor was included in the second round of <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> genomic duplication .
Examination of higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> led to the identification of splice variants of TACC1 and TACC2 in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10090"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Mus musculus </term> </term> , and the assembly of the previously unidentified orthologues of TACC1-3 from <termsem="NCBITaxon:10116"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Rattus norvegus </term> </term> .
In addition , the TACC1X sequence was found on <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> chromosome X .
This gene is clearly related to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> TACC1 , however , further examination revealed a <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> B1 repeat distributed over the length of the proposed intron .
In addition , no expression of TACC1X was detected in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> RNA by rt-PCR analysis ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this sequence is a processed pseudogene .
Similarly , TACC1 pseudogenes also exist spread over 22 kb of the centromeric region of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 10 and , in 8q21 , a shorter region 86 % identical to the final 359 bp of the TACC1 3 ' untranslated region .
No pseudogenes corresponding to TACC2 or TACC3 were identified in any <termsem="NCBITaxon:40674"> mammalian </term> <termsem="species"> species </term> .
Characterization of <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC3 orthologues .
Based upon current functional analysis , the characterization of TACC3 orthologues is likely to be pivotal to understanding the sequence and functional evolution of the TACC gene family .
As indicated below , the chromosomal region containing the TACC gene precursors was duplicated twice during <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> evolution .
Although the analysis of <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodents </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> so far suggests that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC3 precursor was not included in the second round of genomic duplication , it could not be excluded that a TACC4 gene may have been lost during the evolution of these lineages .
The cloning of a new member of the TACC family in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Oryctolagus cuniculus </term> </term> has added to this controversy [ 9 ] .
Designated TACC4 , the 1.5 kb cDNA was highly related , but proposed to be distinct from TACC3 .
However , Northern blot data suggested that this gene produces a single 2.3 kb transcript [ 9 ] , indicating that the cloned cDNA was incomplete .
The degree of similarity to the published sequence of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> TACC3 suggested to us that TACC4 actually represents a partial <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> TACC3 cDNA .
To test this hypothesis , we set out to clone the complete <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> TACC3 sequence , based upon the known features of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> TACC3 .
We have previously noted that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> TACC3 proteins are highly conserved ( [ 2 ] , see below ) .
Therefore , based upon the sequence identity between these genes , we designed a consensus oligonucleotide primer , T3con2 , that would be suitable for the identification of the region containing the initiator methionine of the TACC3 cDNAs from <termsem="NCBITaxon:9443"> primates </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodents </term> .
Using this primer , in combination with the TACC4-specific RACE primer ( RACE2 ) , initially used by Steadman et al [ 9 ] , we isolated a 1.5 kb PCR product from <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> brain cDNA by rt-PCR .
In combination with 3 ` RACE , this generated a consensus cDNA of 2283 bp which corresponds to the transcript size of 2.3 kb detected by the `` TACC4 '' sequence reported in Figure 4 of Steadman et al [ 9 ] .
Thus , while it remains possible that the `` TACC4 '' sequence is an alternative splice product , or is the product of reduplication of the TACC3 gene ( events that would be specific to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> ) , the only transcript detected in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> RNA corresponds to the predicted transcript size of the TACC3 sequence that we have identified here .
Furthermore , the string of nucleotides found at the 5 ' end of the `` TACC4 '' sequence is also found at the 5 ' ends of a number of cDNA sequences ( e.g. U82468 , NM_023500 ) , that were isolated by 5 ` RACE , suggesting that they may correspond to an artefact of the 5 ` RACE methodology used in their construction .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> `` TACC4 '' and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> TACC3 sequence that we have isolated are also found on the same branch of the TACC phylogenetic tree with the other TACC3 orthologues , including maskin ( <termsem="NCBITaxon:8355"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Xenopus laevis </term> </term> ) , and the newly identified TACC3 sequences in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10116"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Rattus norvegus </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:9031"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Gallus gallus </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:8364"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Silurana tropicalis </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7955"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Danio rerio </term> </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> , reported in this manuscript ( Fig. 1 ) .
Thus , it is not in a separate branch that may be expected if the sequence was a distinct TACC family member .
Placement of the RHAMM gene in the phylogeny of the coiled coil gene family .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> Human </term> RHAMM has also been proposed to be the missing fourth member of the TACC family [ 10 ] .
Evidence used in support of this claim included its chromosomal location on 5q32 in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> ( discussed below ) , its sequence similarity in its coiled coil domain to the TACC domain and the subcellular localization of the RHAMM protein in the centrosome .
However , if RHAMM were a bona fide TACC family member , then we would predict its evolution would be similar to those of other TACC family members , and fit with the proposed evolution of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> genome .
Thus , we set out to identify RHAMM orthologues and related genes in <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> metazoans </term> , so that a more complete phylogeny of the coiled coil super family could be generated .
We identified a single RHAMM gene in all <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostomes </term> for which cDNA and/or genomic sequence was available , including <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> .
No RHAMM gene was identified in <termsem="NCBITaxon:6960"> insects </term> or <termsem="NCBITaxon:6231"> nematodes </term> .
This indicates that the RHAMM/TACC genes diverged after the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostome </term> / <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostome </term> split 833 -- 933 MYA , but prior to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7586"> echinodermata </term> / <termsem="NCBITaxon:7712"> urochordate </term> divergence ( > 750 MYA ) .
Significantly , sequence and phylogenetic analysis of coiled coil proteins ( Fig. 1 ) clearly shows that RHAMM does not contain a TACC domain and instead forms a distinct family of proteins in the coiled coil superfamily , and is not a direct descendant of the ancestral TACC gene .
Evolution of the chromosomal segments containing the TACC genes .
The phylogenetic tree of the FGFR genes closely resembles that of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC1-3 genes .
Recently , detailed analyses of the chromosomal regions containing the FGFR gene family in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:6656"> arthopod </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> have revealed the conservation of paralogous chromosomal segments between these <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> ( Fig. 2 , [ 13 ] , Table 1 [ see Additional file 1 ] ) .
This has provided further support that an ancient chromosomal segment was duplicated twice during <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> evolution , with the first duplication that gave rise to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 4p16/5q32-ter and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 8p/10q23-ter ancestors occurring in the early stages after the invertebrate divergence .
This suggests that the ancestral FGFR-TACC gene pair most probably arose prior to the initial duplication and subsequent divergence of these paralogous chromosomal segments , estimated to have occurred 687  155.7 MYA .
This has raised the suggestion that a fourth TACC gene in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> would reside in the same chromosomal region as FGFR4 .
Indeed this hypothesis has been used in support for the RHAMM gene as a member of the TACC family [ 10 ] .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> Human </term> RHAMM maps to chromosome 5q32 in a region bounded by GPX3 and NKX2E .
These loci separate two clusters of genes on <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 5 that are paralogous with 4p16 .
Interestingly , these three clusters are located on different chromosomes in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> ( Fig. 2 ) , further suggesting that this cluster of genes was transposed into this region after the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9443"> primate </term> / <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodent </term> divergence .
Linear organization of gene clusters centering upon the chromosomal loci of the FGFR genes in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> .
Paralogous genes present in at least two of the four loci are shown , with the exception of the region between GPX3 and NKX2E on chromosome 5 , which appears to represent a series of intervening genes inserted after duplication of the 4p16/5q32 -35 clusters , and genes mentioned in Fig. 3 .
Corresponding syntenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> chromosomal regions ( mm * ) are indicated .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Takifugu rubripes </term> </term> scaffolds are shown ( TR * ) that contain more than one homologous gene from these clusters .
Further details on the location of paralogous genes can be found in [ see Additional file 1 ] .
Because the conservation of gene order can also provide clues to the evolution of gene regulation , we next attempted to trace the evolution of these paralogous segments by examining the genome of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7712"> tunicate </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> [ 11 ] and the most `` primitive '' compact <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> genome sequenced to date , <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> [ 14 ] .
Although not fully assembled , examination of the genome of <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> confirmed the presence of chromosomal segments paralogous to those found in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> ( Fig. 2 ) .
For instance , the orthologues of GPRK2L and RGS12 are found on <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> scaffold 290 ( emb | CAAB01000290 .1 ) , and within 300 kb of each other in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> 4p16 .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> orthologues of FGFR3 , LETM1 and WHSC1 are located on the same 166 kb genomic scaffold 251 ( emb | CAAB01000166 .1 ) .
Significantly , the three <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> orthologues of these genes are also located within 300 kb of each other on 4p16 .
Furthermore , TACC3 and FGFRL map to the overlapping scaffolds 1184/4669 ( emb | CAAB01004668 ) .
Similarly , elements of these gene clusters , extending from HMP19 to GPRK6 in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 5q34-ter are also found in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> , with the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> orthologues of NSD1 , FGFR4 and a RAB-like gene mapping on scaffold 407 ( emb | CAAB01000407 ) .
However , there is no evidence for a gene corresponding to a TACC4 gene in any of these clusters .
As noted above , phylogenetic analysis of the TACC sequences indicate that there are two TACC1 related genes in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> .
trTACC1B is located on the 180 kb scaffold 191 ( emb | CAAB01000191 .1 ) , which also contains the orthologues of several genes located in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 8p21-11 .
Thus , this scaffold represents the more `` developed '' TACC1 chromosomal segment that is evident in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> .
On the other hand , the trTACC1A gene is located in the 396 kb scaffold 12 ( emb | CAAB010012 .1 ) .
This scaffold also contains the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> orthologues of MSX1 , STX18 , D4S234E and the predicted gene LOC118711 , in addition to sequences with homology to LOXL , EVC , LOC159291 , and the LDB family .
Thus , scaffold 12 contains genes found in the regions of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> chromosome 4 and 10 that also contain the loci for TACC3 and TACC2 , respectively , and may therefore more closely resemble the genomic organization resulting from the initial duplication of the ancestral paralogous chromosomal segment .
Conserved paralogous clusters may result from the initial clustering of the genes in a relatively small ancestral genomic contig .
Some evidence for the existence of `` protoclusters '' that could correspond to the paralogous chromosomal segments noted in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> is present in the genome of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7712"> urochordate </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> [ 11 ] .
For instance , the orthologues of FGFR , and WHSC1 , carboxypeptidase Z and FLJ25359 cluster within an 85 kb region of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> genome and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> orthologues are still maintained in paralogous segments of 4p16 , 8p and 10q ( Fig. 3 , [ see Additional file 1 ] ) .
However , it should be noted that no clusters of genes from the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> paralogous segments are locate close to the TACC or RHAMM genes of <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> , indicating that the formation of the much larger paralogous segments encompassing the FGFR-TACC genes formed later in evolutionary time , or conversely have been subject to extensive rearrangement in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7712"> tunicates </term> .
In combination with the examination of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> genome , this also provides additional evidence that either the second round of duplication of the chromosomal segment that contained the FGFR3/4 ancestor did not include a TACC gene , or that such a gene was lost very early in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> evolution , prior to the divergence of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:61463"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Gnanthostome </term> </term> lineages .
However , the final resolution of the initial evolution of these paralogous segment will await the sequencing of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7735"> amphioxus </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7745"> lamprey </term> genomes , which only have one FGFR gene , and therefore should only contain one copy of the other corresponding genes in this conserved segment .

The genomic DNA sequences corresponding to the orthologous TACC genes of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> were extracted and analyzed by Genescan and BLAST to determine the genomic structure of each TACC gene .
In some cases , for <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> , exons were added or modified based on the best similarity of translated peptides to the corresponding <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> proteins .
For regions with low sequence similarity in <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> T. rubripes </term> </term> , genomic sequences from the fresh water <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:99883"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Tetraodon nigroviridis </term> </term> were used as additional means to verify the predicted exons .
The general structure of the TACC genes and proteins is depicted in Fig. 4 .
The main conserved feature of the TACC family , the TACC domain , is located at the carboxy terminus of the protein .
In the case of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> TAC protein , this structure comprises the majority of the protein and is encoded by two of the three exons of the gene .
In the higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> , and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostomes </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:7719"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. intestinalis </term> </term> to <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> , this feature is also encoded by the final exons of the gene ( five in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> , seven in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostome </term> genes ) .
Outside of the TACC domain , however , TACC family members show relatively little homology .
It is interesting that each TACC gene contains one large exon , which shows considerable variability between TACC orthologues , and constitutes the main difference between the TACC3 genes in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> ( see below ) .
In <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostomes </term> , this exon contains the SDP repeat ( or in the case of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> TACC3 's , a <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodent </term> - specific 24 amino acid repeat ) , which is responsible for the binding of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex component GAS41 [ 15,16 ] .
Of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC proteins , the TACC3 orthologues show the greatest variability in size and sequence , ranging in size from 599 amino acids for the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> TACC3 protein , to 942 amino acids in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7955"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Danio rerio </term> </term> protein .
The reasons for these differences are apparent from the genomic structure of the TACC3 orthologues .
TACC3 can be divided into three sections : a conserved N-terminal region ( CNTR ) of 108 amino acids , encoded by exons 2 and 3 in each <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC3 gene , the conserved TACC domain distributed over the final seven exons , and a highly variable central region .
The lack of conservation in both size and sequence of the central portion of the TACC3 proteins of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> has been previously noted , and accounts for the major difference between these two orthologues [ 2 ] .
The majority of this central portion , which contains the SDP repeat motifs , is encoded by one exon in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> ( emb | CAAB01001184 ) .
In <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodents </term> , however , this region is almost entirely composed of seven 24 amino acid repeats , which are located in a single exon of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> TACC3 genes .
It has been previously reported that there are four <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> TACC3 splice variants that differ in the number of these repeats [ 2,7,17 ] .
As these repeats are present in a single exon , it appears likely that these different sequences may be the result of the DNA polymerases used in the cDNA synthesis and/or PCR reaction stuttering through the repeat motif .
The correct sequence , reported by Sadek et al [ 7 ] , is the one used throughout the entirety of this manuscript .
These repeats are not evident in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> protein , or any other TACC protein , and may indicate that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodent </term> TACC3 has evolved distinct functions , as has already been noted for the <termsem="NCBITaxon:8292"> amphibian </term> <termsem="NCBITaxon:8353"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Xenopus </term> </term> TACC3 , maskin [ 8 ] .
Alternative splicing in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC genes .
Whereas exon shuffling can drive the functional diversification of gene families over evolutionary time , the temporal and/or tissue specific alternative splicing of a gene can give rise to functional diversification of a single gene during the development of an <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organism </term> .
Although no alternative splicing of TACC3 has been clearly documented , both temporal and tissue specific splicing is observed in the TACC1 and TACC2 genes .
In the case of TACC2 , an additional large ( 5 kb ) exon accounts for the main difference between the major splice variants of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC2 genes [ 3 ] .
The alternative splicing of this exon suggests a major functional difference between the two TACC2 isoforms , TACC2s and TACC2l [ 3 ] , as well as a significant difference between TACC2 and its closest TACC family relative , TACC1 .
However , the function of this region of the TACC2l isoform is current unknown .
Alternative splicing , together with differential promoter usage has already been noted for the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC1 gene [ 18,19 ] .
In addition , as shown in Fig. 5 , we have identified additional TACC1 isoforms that result from alternative splicing of exons 1b-4a .
The functions of these different isoforms are unknown , however the region deleted from the shorter variants can include the binding site for LSm7 [ 20 ] ( variants C , D , F-I ) , and/or the nuclear localization signals and binding site for GAS41 [ 15 ] and PCTAIRE2BP [ 20 ] ( isoforms B-D , S ) .
One of these isoforms , TACC1S is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm [ 19 ] , suggesting that the shorter isoforms would not be able to interact with elements of the chomatin remodeling and/or RNA processing machinery in the nucleus .
Thus , changes in the complement of TACC1 isoforms in the cell may result in alterations in cellular RNA metabolism at multiple levels , and may account for the observation that TACC1D and TACC1F isoforms are associated with tumorigenic changes in gastric mucosa [ 18 ] .
Alternative splicing of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC1 gene .
( A ) : Seven splice variants have been identified for <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC1 ( A-F and S ) .
We have also identified additional splice variants ( G-I ) from database analysis and rt-PCR analysis of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> brain RNA .
( B ) : Alternative splicing of TACC1 in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> brain .
rt-PCR analysis confirms splicing of the untranslated exon 1a to exon 1 , with retention of the originally defined start methionine ( GB : NP_006274 ) ( Variant A * , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
Exon 1a also splices to exon 2 , removing the L-Sm7 binding motif ( variant I , lanes 3,12 and 13 ) .
Variants that functionally delete exons 2 and/or 3 , such as variant C ( lane 15 ) also remove the predicted nuclear localization signals , and the binding domains for GAS41 and PCTAIRE2BP .
These variants would retain the TACC domain , and therefore the potential to bind to ch-TOG and Aurora A kinase in the centrosome .

In silico modeling of the evolution of TACC protein function .
The protein and genomic structure of the present day TACC family members suggests that the function of the ancestral TACC protein was mediated solely through the interactions of the conserved TACC domain .
Using an in silico protein-protein interaction model based upon known mitotic spindle and centrosomal components , we have previously predicted a number of additional interactions that could be conserved between a functional TACC homologue in <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> , spc-72 , and one or more <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC proteins [ 21 ] .
Thus , it is known that all the TACC proteins examined to date interact , via the TACC domain , with the microtubule/centrosomal proteins of the stu2/msps/ch-TOG family [ 5,6,22-24 ] , and with the Aurora kinases [ 20,21,25 ] .
These interactions are required for the accumulation of the D-TACC , spc72 , ceTAC1 and TACC3 proteins to the centrosome [ 5,6,22-24 ] .
Hence , this functional interaction with the centrosome and mitotic spindle is likely to represent the ancient , conserved function of the TACC family .
However , it is apparent that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC proteins also differ in their ability to interact with the Aurora kinases .
For instance , TACC1 and TACC3 interact with Aurora A kinase , whereas TACC2 interacts with Aurora C kinase [ 21 ] , suggesting a degree of functional specialization in the derivatives of the ancestral <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> TACC , after the radiation of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC genes .
The localization of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC proteins in the interphase nucleus [ 15,26,27 ] suggests that they have additional functions outside their ancient role in the centrosome and microtubule dynamics .
Thus , it seems likely that TACC family members in <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostomes </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostomes </term> have integrated new unique functions as the evolving TACC genes acquired additional exons .
The results of the pilot large-scale proteomic analysis in <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> provide further suggestive evidence to this functional evolution .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> Yeast </term> two hybrid analysis indicates that ceTAC directly binds to <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> lin15A , lin36 and lin37 [ 28 ] .
These proteins bridge ceTAC to other elements of the cytoskeleton and microtubule network , as well as to components of the ribosome , the histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling machinery such as egr-1 and lin-53 ( the <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> homologues of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> MTA-1 and RbAP48 ) , and to transcription factors such as the PAL1 homeobox and the nuclear hormone receptor nhr-86 [ 28 ] ( Fig. 6A ) .
Similarly , large scale proteomics [ 29 ] has shown that <termsem="NCBITaxon:7215"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Drosophila </term> </term> TACC interacts with two proteins , the RNA binding protein TBPH and CG14540 ( Fig. 6B ) , and thus indirectly with the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7215"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Drosophila </term> </term> SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and DNA damage repair machinery .
Significantly , the ceTAC protein has also recently been implicated in DNA repair through its direct interaction with the <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> BARD1 orthologue [ 30 ] .
It should be noted that a number of interactions with the TACC proteins from these <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> have probably been missed by these large scale methods , including the well documented direct interactions with the aurora kinases and the stu2/msps/ch-TOG family .
Functional evolution of the TACC proteins modeled in <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> .

It is also of interest that this predicts a functional interaction with the LDB family , members of which are also found in TACC containing paralogous segments noted in Figs 2 , 3 and Additional file 1 .

In C , D and E , ' * ' denotes one or more members of the TACC or Aurora kinase family .
Because of the evolutionary conservation of the TACC domain , we would predict that some of the functional interactions seen in <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> would be observed in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> .
Phylogenetic profiling from these interaction maps suggests two similar sets of predicted interactions for <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACCs ( Fig. 6C and 6D ) .
Strikingly , however , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> specific proteins lin15A , lin36 and lin37 do not have readily discernible homologues in <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrates </term> or <termsem="NCBITaxon:7215"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Drosophila </term> </term> , although the presence of a zinc finger domain in lin36 may suggest that this protein is involved directly in transcription or perform an adaptor role similar to LIM containing proteins .
For the DTACC interacting proteins , TBPH corresponds to TDP43 , a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation and splicing [ 31,32 ] .
However , the assignment of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> homologue of CG14540 is less clear , with the closest matches in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> databases corresponding to glutamine rich transcription factors such as CREB and the G-box binding factor .
Comparison of modeled with experimentally defined interactions of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC proteins .
The interaction data for the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACCs is relatively limited ; however , interaction networks are now beginning to emerge .
The results of our functional analysis , as well as other published data clearly indicate that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACCs interact with proteins that can be divided into two broad categories : 1 ) proteins with roles in centrosome/mitotic spindle dynamics , and 2 ) proteins involved in gene regulation , either at the level of transcription , or subsequent RNA processing and translation [ 3,5-7,15,19-21,24,25,33,34 ] .
Many of these proteins do not appear to interact directly with the protostome TACCs , but would be expected to be in the same protein complex ( Fig. 6C ,6 D ) .
Significant analysis of the association of the TACCs with the centrosome and the dynamics of mitotic spindle assembly from <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> to humans has been published [ 5,6,21-24 ] .
From this analysis , it seems likely that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC3 protein has retained this direct ancestral function , based upon its location in these structures during mitosis [ 27 ] , its strong interaction with Aurora Kinase A , and the observation that it is the only <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC protein phosphorylated by this enzyme [ 21 ] .
However , the variability of the central domain of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> orthologues , suggests that TACC3 may also have acquired additional , and in some instances , <termsem="species"> species </term> - specific functions .
For instance , in <termsem="NCBITaxon:8355"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> X. laevis </term> </term> , the maskin protein has acquired a binding site for the eIF4E protein , and thus a function in the coordinated control of polyadenylation and translation in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:8353"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Xenopus </term> </term> oocyte [ 8,35 ] .
A recent study has suggested that this function may be unique to maskin : although it is unclear whether the other <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC3 proteins interact with the eIF4E/CPEB complex , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC1A isoform is unable to interact with the eIF4E/CPEB complex .
Instead , some TACC1 isoforms have evolved a related , but distinct function by directly interacting with elements of the RNA splicing and transport machinery [ 19 ] .
To further characterize the evolving functions of the TACC proteins , we have used an unbiased <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> two hybrid screening method to identify proteins that bind to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC proteins [ 3,34 ] .
In a screen of a MATCHMAKER fetal brain library ( BD Biosciences Clontech ) , in addition to isolating the histone acetyltransferase hGCN5L2 [ 34 ] , we also identified the 3 isoform of retinoid-X receptor  as a protein that interacts with the TACC domain of TACC2 .
As shown in Fig. 7 , this interaction is confirmed in vitro by GST-pull down analysis .
Significantly , RXR is a close family relative of the nuclear hormone receptor , nhr-86 , from <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> , which interacts with the ceTAC binding protein lin36 ( Fig. 6A ) .
This suggests that while <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostome </term> TACCs may require additional protein factors to interact with such components , the TACCs in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> may have evolved the ability to directly interact with some of the proteins in the predicted interaction map ( Fig. 6E ) .
Indeed , this appears to be directly linked to the acquisition of new domains and duplication of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> TACC precursor .
In fact , the first identified function of a <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC protein was as a transcriptional coactivator acting through a direct interaction with the ARNT transcription factor [ 7 ] .
It is also intriguing that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostome </term> specific SDP repeat interacts with GAS41 , a component/accessory factor of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [ 3,15 ] .
Although there is a <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> homologue of GAS41 , dmGAS41 , the large scale proteomic interaction database does not indicate a direct interaction of dmGAS41 with DTACC .
This may be due to the lack of the SDP repeat region in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7215"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Drosophila </term> </term> TACC protein .
This further suggests that the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACCs have gained the specific ability to direct interact with transcriptional regulatory complexes , and that bridging protein ( s ) are no longer required .
Thus , where the ceTAC protein is only composed of the TACC domain , the significantly larger TACC family members in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostomes </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostomes </term> may have integrated one or more functions of the bridging protein ( in this case lin15A , lin36 or lin37 ) .
This may also explain the absence of lin15A , lin36 and lin37 homologues in higher <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> , as they were no longer under selective evolutionary pressure to remain within the complex , and thus lost in the evolving genome .

Proposed functional evolution of the TACC family .
Examination of the evolution of ancient gene families provides an insight into how gene structure relates to function .
We have presented above , a detailed examination of one such gene family .
The data so far suggest that the functional TACC homologue in <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> ( spc72 ) has a specific role in centrosomal/mitotic spindle dynamics [ 21,22 ] .
This ancient TACC function is conserved throughout evolution in both <termsem="NCBITaxon:33317"> protostomes </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:33511"> deuterostomes </term> .
In addition , the TACC proteins of lower <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> appear to interact with bridging proteins that are components of several different protein complexes involved in DNA damage repair , protein translation , RNA processing and transcription .
However , over the process of evolutionary time , with the acquisition of new domains and duplication of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> TACC precursor , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:7711"> chordate </term> TACC proteins have acquired the ability to directly interact with some of the other components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins , nuclear hormone receptors , GAS41 , accessory proteins and transcription factors ) , and thus evolved additional functions within these complexes .
Indeed , the first assigned function of a <termsem="NCBITaxon:7742"> vertebrate </term> TACC protein , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> TACC3 , was as a transcriptional coactivator of the ARNT mediated transcriptional response to hypoxia and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [ 7 ] .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mouse </term> TACC3 has also been reported to interact with the transcription factor STAT5 [ 33 ] .
Recently , we have demonstrated that TACC2 and TACC3 can bind to nuclear histone acetyltransferases [ 34 ] , further confirming a more direct role for the TACC proteins in transcriptional and chromatin remodeling events .
Interestingly although all <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> TACC proteins can directly interact with the histone acetyltransferase pCAF in vitro , the TACC1 isoforms expressed in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> breast cancer cells do not interact with this histone acetylase [ 34 ] .
This may be attributable to the proposed function of the Exon 1 containing TACC1 variants in RNA processing , via the interaction with LSm-7 and SmG [ 19 ] .
Thus , alternative splicing of the TACC1 gene adds further diversity to TACC1 function , as the deletion of specific exons and their associated binding domains will change the potential protein complexes with which they can associate , either directly , or by redirecting the splice variants to different subcellular compartments .
With the duplication of the TACC1/TACC2 ancestor , it is apparent that an even greater functional diversity may have been introduced into the TACC family .
The TACC2 protein retains the ability of TACC3 to interact with GAS41 , INI1 , histone acetyltransferases and transcription factors ( in this case , RXR ) ( Fig. 7 ) [ 3,34 ] .
However , the tissue specific splicing of the 5 kb exon in the TACC2l isoform [ 3 ] indicates that this protein has several temporal and tissue specific functions yet to be identified .
Compilation and assembly of previously uncharacterized TACC cDNAs and genes .
Corresponding orthologous sequences for TACC , RHAMM , KLP , KIF , TPM and keratins families were identified initially using the TBLASTN program [ 36 ] to search the published genomic and cDNA databases .
For <termsem="NCBITaxon:31033"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Takifugu rubripes </term> </term> , gene predictions were produced by the Ensembl automated pipeline [ 37 ] and the JGI blast server .
DNA sequences covering the homology regions were extracted and analyzed by Genscan to obtain potential exons .
In some cases , exons were added or modified based on the best similarity of translated peptides to the corresponding <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> proteins .
For regions with low sequence similarity , genomic sequences from the fresh water <termsem="NCBITaxon:31031"> pufferfish </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:99883"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Tetraodon nigroviridis </term> </term> were used as additional means to verify the predicted exons .

These protein sequences were initially aligned with CLUSTAL X [ 38 ] .
Minor adjustments to certain regions of the alignment for optimization purposes were made based on pairwise alignments , the output saved in PHYLIP format , after which , the distances between proteins were calculated using Poisson correction and the Unrooted trees were inferred with the NJ method and then displayed using TreeView [ 39 ] .
Bootstrap values above 700 for 1000 trials are shown at the node .
To validate the tree , the same sequence set was analyzed with tools in the PHYLIP package [ 40 ] , using PRODIST followed by FITCH or NEIGNBOR and tree displaying using TreeView .
This additional method produced trees with essentially the same topology ( data not shown ) .

Location of paralogous genes found on <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> 4p16 , 5q31-ter , 10q23-ter , 8p and chromosome 2 .
Positions of genes are given in Mb from the telomere of the short arm of the chromosome .
Blue highlighted genes ( five copies ) are found in all four paralogous segments , and the partially duplicated segment on chromosome 2 .
Green highlighted genes are found in either all four paralogous segments , or three of the segments and the partially duplicated region on chromosome 2 .
Pink highlighted genes have paralogues in three of the segments , suggesting either loss of the fourth copy or exclusion of one paralogue from the second round of duplication .
Black highlighted genes ( two paralogues ) are found in only one of the derivatives of the second round of genome duplication , suggesting complete exclusion of both copies from the second round of duplication .
Purple highlighted genes ( two paralogues ) were duplicated at the second round of genome duplication , or from interchromosomal recombination between paralogous clusters .
