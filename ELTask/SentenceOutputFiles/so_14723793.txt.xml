Molecular cloning and characterization of the mouse Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
We have recently cloned and characterized a novel <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family named ancient <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> protein ( ACDP ) in humans .
To facilitate the functional study of this novel <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family , we have cloned and characterized Acdp , the mouse <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> of the human ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
The four Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Acdp1 , Acdp2 , Acdp3 and Acdp4 ) contain 3,631 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> , 3,244 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> , 2,684 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> and 2,743 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> , and encode <termsem="SO:0000732"> deduced </term> proteins of 951 , 874 , 713 and 771 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , respectively .
The mouse Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> showed very strong <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> ( > 90 % ) in both <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> and <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequences </term> to their human <termsem="SO:0000853"> counterparts </term> .
In addition , both <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> and <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequences </term> within the Ancient <termsem="SO:0000856"> Conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> Domain </term> ( ACD ) are highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> in many different taxonomic species .
Particularly , Acdp proteins showed very strong <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> to the bacteria CorC protein ( 35 % <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> identity with 55 % <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> ) , which is involved in magnesium and cobalt efflux .
The Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are widely expressed in all tissues tested except for Acdp1 , which is only highly expressed in the brain with low levels of expression in kidney and testis .
Immunostaining of Acdp1 in hippocampus neurons revealed a predominant localization on the plasma membrane .
The Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionarily conserved </term> in diverse species and ubiquitously expressed throughout development and adult tissues suggesting that Acdp may be an essential <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Acdp showed strong <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> to bacteria CorC protein and predominantly localized on the plasma membrane .
These results suggest that Acdp is probably a family of proteins involved in ion transport in mammalian cells .
We have recently cloned and characterized a novel <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family named ancient <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> protein ( ACDP ) which encodes four protein members in humans [ 1 ] .
We found that this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family is <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionarily conserved </term> in diverse species ranging from bacteria , yeast , C. elegans , and D. melanogaster to mammals .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> and the presence of multiple members within a species may imply functional importance associated with the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
To facilitate the functional analysis of the ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family , we cloned and characterized Acdp , the mouse <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> of the human ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
Molecular cloning of the Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
To clone the mouse Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , the human ACDP cDNA and <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> protein sequences were used to search the mouse <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> database with the blastn and tblastn programs .
Mouse <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> markers corresponding to each Acdp member were then identified .
For example , <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> H3086H12-5 corresponds to Acdp1 , W98010 for Acdp2 , 603299135F1 for Acdp3 and BG083791 for Acdp4 .
A <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> - dT with a M13 tail was used for the RT reaction .
A <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primer </term> from each <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> marker and the M13 <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000696"> olig </term> - dT tail ) were used to amplify the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR sequence </term> for each corresponding Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> from the RT <termsem="SO:0000006"> products </term> .
To obtain 5 ' - end <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequences </term> for the Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , we conducted a series nested PCR with combinations of mouse and human <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequences </term> were identified by directly sequencing <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> containing the corresponding Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were identified by screening a CITB mouse <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> library ( Research Genetics ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequences </term> obtained from above were further confirmed by RT-PCR .
The Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> contains 3,631 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of <termsem="SO:0000348"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> sequence </term> and encodes a <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> protein with 951 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> ( <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> ) .
The other three Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Acdp2 , 3 and 4 ) contain 3,244 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> , 2,684 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> and 2,743 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> , and encode <termsem="SO:0000732"> deduced </term> proteins of 874 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , 713 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> and 771 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , respectively .
Northern blot analyses of the Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family were carried out using membranes purchased from Origene .
A total of 12 mouse tissues were included in the study ( Fig. 1 ) .
Due to <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> between each Acdp member within the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> for Northern bolts were PCR <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> from the last <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> and the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region sequences </term> .
The mouse Acdp <termsem="SO:0000673"> messages </term> showed almost the same tissue distributions as the human ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0000673"> message </term> is highly expressed in the brain , while kidney and testis also showed low levels of expression .
Acdp2 showed higher expressions in the brain , kidney and liver .
However , the Acdp2 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> was not present in the skeleton muscle and skin , and it showed very low levels of expression in the rest of tissues .
Acdp3 and Acdp4 showed different levels of expression in all tissues tested ; the highest expressions for Acdp3 were observed in the brain , kidney , liver and heart , and the highest expressions for Acdp4 were observed in the kidney , small intestine and testis .
The expression levels for Acdp3 and 4 in skeleton muscle were barely detectable ; however , -actin showed normal expression suggesting that the results were not a consequence of bad <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> quality ( data not shown ) .
The ubiquitous expression pattern may be taken as another indication of the functional importance of Acdp proteins in fundamental biological processes in addition to the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> in evolutionarily divergent species .

Multiple Choice Northern Blot filters were purchased from Origene .
Radiation hybrid mapping indicated that the Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> maps to <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 19 between markers D19Mit119 ( 34.3 cR proximal ) and D19Mit112 ( 13.6 cR distal ) .
The Acdp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> maps slightly more distal to the Acdp1 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 19 between D19Mit9 ( 2.4 cR proximal ) and D19Mit38 ( 15.1 cR distal ) .
The Acdp3 and Acdp4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> map to <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 1 within one <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000151"> clone </term> ( RP23-294I17 ) , proximal to marker D1Mit171 ( 17.4 cR ) .
These <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> are <termsem="SO:0000860"> syntenic </term> to the human <termsem="SO:0000853"> counterparts </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> and molecular characteristics .
The mouse Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> showed very strong <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> of both <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> and <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> sequences </term> to the human ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Table 1 ) .
The highest <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> were observed between the human ACDP2 and the mouse Acdp2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( 91 % of <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> identity , 97 % of <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> identity and 99.4 % of <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> ) .
In addition , the <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR <termsem="SO:0000348"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> </term> sequences </term> ( 20 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotides </term> before <termsem="SO:0000318"> start codon </term> ) also showed high <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> to the human <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologs </term> , for example , the Acdp2 <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequence </term> showed 95 % identities to its human <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> .
However , the <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> in the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR sequences </term> ( 20 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotides </term> after <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> ) were much lower ( 40 -- 55 % ) for all Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> except Acdp4 ( 90 % identity to its human <termsem="SO:0000853"> homolog </term> ) .
The ancient <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( ACD ) has 55.3 % of <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> identity and 83.3 % of <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> between all mouse and human ACDP proteins ( Fig. 2 ) .
The ACD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> is <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionarily conserved </term> in divergent species ranging from bacteria , yeast , C. elegans , D. melanogaster , mouse to human ( Fig. 3 ) .
Particularly , as shown in Fig. 3 , Acdp proteins showed very strong <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> to bacteria CorC protein ( 35 % <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> identity with 55 % <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> ) , which is involved in magnesium and cobalt efflux [ 7 ] .
High <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> was also observed between the Acdp proteins and the yeast Amip3 protein ( 35 % <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> identity with 56 % <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> ) .
The Amip3 is likely to be a <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> to the bacteria CorC protein .
The Amip3 <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutants </term> confer resistance to copper toxicity ( Personal communication with Dr. V.C. Culotte , John Hopkins Bloomberg , School of Public Health ) .

Phylogenetic tree showing relationships among proteins containing the ACD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> from figure 2 and 3 .
The phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the calculation of the best <termsem="SO:0000343"> match </term> for the selected <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
Abbreviations for each protein are the same as presented in figure 3 .
We found that all mouse Acdp members contain four distinct transmembrane <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> ( Fig. 5 ) , two CBS <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> and a DUF21 <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> that are found in bacteria CorC and yeast Amip3 proteins .
CBS <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> are small intracellular <termsem="SO:0000417"> modules </term> that are mostly found in 2 or four copies within a protein .
Pairs of CBS <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> dimerise to form a stable globular <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> [ 8 ] .
DUF21 ( CD : pfam01959 .9 ) is a newly defined <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> with unknown function .
This <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> is a <termsem="SO:0001077"> transmembrane region </term> and found to be located in the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminus </term> of the proteins adjacent to two intracellular CBS <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
A cNMP-binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate-binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ) was found in all Acdp members .

The plot shows the posterior probabilities of inside / outside/TM <termsem="SO:0001114"> helix </term> .
At the top of the plot ( between 1 and 1.2 ) the N-best prediction is shown .

In addition , Acdp1 contains an <termsem="SO:0001435"> Alanine </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( 2 -- 10 : AAAAAAAAA ) , a <termsem="SO:0001437"> Leucine </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( 204 -- 257 : LLRVRPRLYGPGGDLLPPAWLRALGALLLLALSALF SGLRLSLLSLDPVELRVL ) , a <termsem="SO:0001439"> Proline </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( 78 -- 130 : PGPPVPAAPVPAPSLA PGENGTGDWAPRLVFIEEPPGAGGAAPSAVPTRPPGP ) , and two amidation <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> ( 917 -- 920 : MGKK ; 926 -- 929 : SGRK ) .
Acdp2 has a <termsem="SO:0001443"> glycine </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( 201 -- 222 : GAGGSGSASGTVGGKGGAGVAG ) .

Antibody production , Western results and subcellular localization .
<termsem="SO:0001407"> Peptides </term> from Acdp1 N - ( TSFLLRVYFQPGPPATAAPVPSPT ) and C - ( TQQLTLSPAAVPTR ) terminuses , <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> from ACD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of Acdp1 ( HNIVDILFVKDLAFVDPDDCTPLLTVTRF ) were commercially synthesized ( Sigma Genosys ) .
These antigenic <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> were predicted by software from Sigma Genosys and polyclonal antibodies for each <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> were produced by immunizing rabbits .
To test the specificity of the antibodies , we conducted Western-blot analysis of mouse brain tissue extracts .
As shown in Fig. 6A , the antibody produced by <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> specifically detected Acdp1 ( lane 3 ) .
The antibody generated by <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> recognized Acdp4 in addition to Acdp1 , although the reactivity to latter was significantly higher ( Fig. 6A , lane 2 ) .
As expected , the antibody produced by the <termsem="SO:0000330"> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> detected all Acdp proteins ( Fig. 6A , lane 1 ) .
To further determine the specificity of the antibody against the Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> , we analyzed extracts of HEK293 , 3T3 and PC12 cells .
The results are shown in Fig. 6B .
Apparently , this antibody detected a specific band of Acdp1 in all cell lysates .
Of note , shown in Fig. 6B are signals of 10 g extracts of HEK293 cell lysates , 100 g extracts of 3T3 and PC12 cell lysates .
Thus , the expression levels of Acdp1 in these cell types vary a lot , with the highest expression in HEK293 cells .
Nevertheless , these immunoblot results support our analysis of brain tissue extracts that the antibody against Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> specifically recognizes Acdp-1 .
The specificity of the Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> antibody suggests the possibility of using it to localize Acdp-1 within cells .
Since Northern blot revealed almost exclusive expression of Acdp1 in the brain , we examined its subcellular localization in hippocampus neurons isolated from mouse embryos .
The neurons were cultured on glass coverslips coated with a confluent monolayer of mouse cortical astrocytes in dishes .
Immunostaining was using the Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> specific antibody .
Confocal imaging revealed that Acdp1 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane .
A series of sections of a cell at the thickness of 0.5 micrometer clearly showed membrane location of Acdp1-immunoreactivity ( Fig. 7 ) , which is consistent with the observation of transmembrane <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> within the Acdp proteins .

The step of each imaging section is 0.5 m , from the surface of the neuron ( 0 m ) to the middle plan ( 4.5 m ) .
Although the exact functions of the ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family are not yet elucidated , several lines of evidence suggest that ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> may play an important role in biological processes .
First , these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionarily conserved </term> in many phylogenetically divergent species ; Second , multiple <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are present in a species ; Third , these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are ubiquitously expressed throughout development and adult tissues ( unpublished data ) .
The cloning and characterization of the mouse Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family are a very important step towards the elucidation of the functions of this multigene family .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> analyses revealed that Acdp proteins shared very strong <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologies </term> to the bacteria CorC protein and yeast Amip3 protein .
CorA , B , C and D belong to a protein family involved in both influx and efflux of magnesium and cobalt .
It has been shown that CorA <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutants </term> confer resistance to cobalt toxicity [ 9 ] .
Amip3 appears to be a <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> to CorC protein which is involved in efflux of magnesium and cobalt in bacteria .
Amip3 <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutants </term> confer resistant to copper toxicity .
Acdp proteins also possess the <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> that are found in bacteria CorC and yeast Amip3 proteins , such as the CBS <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> , DUF21 <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and transmembrane <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
In addition , a cNMP-binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> was found in all Acdp proteins , which is usually present in ion channels and cNMP-dependent kinases [ 10-13 ] .
Using antibody produced by Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> , we have shown that Acdp1 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane in hippocampus neurons .
In our previous study , we found human ACDP proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleus in HeLa cells [ 1 ] .
The discrepancy for Acdp localization in neuronal cells could be caused by non-specificity for previous antibody which was produced by the recombinant ACD <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , or different cells used .
In current study , the Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> antibody only recognizes Acdp1 in brain tissue extracts as well as in HEK293 , 3T3 and PC12 cell lysates , suggesting the specificity of the antibody .
Our observations suggested that Acdp might be involved in ion transport in mammalian cells .
However , more detailed functional studies are needed to demonstrate the real functions of these proteins .
Our previous work has described human ACDP <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 1 ] .
The new information of the current work includes : 1 ) .
It is the first time to report the existence of multiple Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in other mammals in addition to human , while Acdp appears to be a single copy <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in lower organisms such as in C. elegans , yeasts and bacteria .
We have also suggested the evolutionary relationships of Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in different species ( phylogenetic tree ) ; 2 ) .
Molecular cloning and characterization of murine Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family are essential for study of this novel <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family in animal model , e.g. for generation of knockout or <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> models ; 3 ) .
We have demonstrated both <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> and <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0000330"> conservations </term> between mouse and human for each Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and the whole Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family , which provide important information for the possibility of functional redundancy or overlap between Acdp members ; 4 ) .
We have generated antibodies specific for Acdp1 and all Acdp proteins .
The Acdp1 <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> antibody appears to specifically recognize Acdp1 .
Using this antibody , we have demonstrated that Acdp1 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane in hippocampus neurons .
These results represent an important step towards the characterization of functions for the Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> cloning of the Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family was performed based on human <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue sequences </term> as previously reported [ 2 ] .
Briefly , the human ACDP <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> and <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> AA </term> sequences </term> were used to search the mouse <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> database for <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> markers corresponding to each Acdp member .
A <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primer </term> within the human ACDP 5 ' <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> ( after <termsem="SO:0000318"> start codon </term> ) and a mouse <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primer </term> from the mouse <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> marker were used to amplify the <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue sequence </term> from mouse <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> at very low annealing temperature ( 45 -- 50 C ) .
A nested PCR using an inside <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primer </term> from the mouse <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST sequence </term> and the same human <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primer </term> was then carried out to amplify the specific mouse <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> from the first round <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> at high annealing temperature ( 62 C ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000732"> expected </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> were directly excised from agarose gel and sequenced by an ABI377 automatic sequencer .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> was further confirmed using a <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primer </term> from newly identified <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> and a <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primer </term> from <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> .
Once most of the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequences </term> were identified , <termsem="SO:0000731"> partial </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 1 and the <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequences </term> were obtained by <termsem="SO:0000153"> BAC </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> sequencing .
Multiple Choice Northern Blot filters containing 12 different mouse tissues were purchased from Origene .
The filters were probed for each Acdp <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> with a PCR <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> ( around 350 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) from last <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> and the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> labeled with -32P dCTP using the <termsem="SO:0000449"> random </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> extension system ( Life Technologies ) .
Hybridizations were carried out overnight .
The filters were washed twice with washing buffer I ( 2  SSC , 0.1 % SDS ) at 42 C for 15-min , and then washed twice with washing buffer II ( 0.25  SSC , 0.1 % SDS ) at 65 C for 15-min .
Washed filters were exposed to X-ray films for overnight or longer [ 3,4 ] .
Antibody production and Western blot analyses .
<termsem="SO:0001407"> Peptides </term> linked to KLH ( keyhole limpet hemacyanin ) from Acdp1 N - and <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminals </term> and the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( ACD ) were used for generation of antibodies specifically for Acdp1 and all Acdp members as reported , respectively [ 5 ] .
Western blots were carried out Using ECL ( PIERCE ) as described previously [ 1 ] .
The membranes were washed extensively after incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and were then developed with X-ray films with optimal exposure time .
The T31 mouse radiation hybrid panel from Research Genetics was used to map the <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> location of each Acdp member .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primers </term> from <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> of each Acdp member were used to amplify the 100 radiation hybrid <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> representing the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
The data were submitted to the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Radiation Hybrid Database for analysis .
Sequence assembly was performed with program Sequencher ( <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> Codes Corp ) .
Protein and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> searches were carried out with tblastn , tblastx , blastp and blastn programs .
Multiple <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignments were performed with GeneDoc and pairwise <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignment .
Multiple programs including BCM Search Launcher , ProfileScan , <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> motif search , ExPASy and 3Dpssm were used for searching <termsem="SO:0000110"> sequence features </term> of <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> protein .
Phylogenetic tree was constructed by Clustalw program ( version 1.81 ) using UPGMA ( Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages ) algorithm [ 14 ] .
Neuronal cell preparation and immunostanining .
Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared as previously reported [ 6 ] .
In brief , the hippocampuses were dissected out from mouse embryos at 16 days in utero .
The tissues were then incubated for 20 min at 37 C in MEM ( minimum essential medium ) modified for suspension culture ( Life Technologies ) plus 0.25 % trypsin ( Life Technologies ) .
The dissociated hippocampal neurons were plated on glass coverslips coated with a confluent monolayer of mouse cortical astrocytes obtained as described below .
The neurons were maintained at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 .
Cortical astrocytes dissociated from newborn mouse cortices were grown in culture flasks at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 until confluent .
The cells were exposed to 10-5 M cytosine arabinoside ( Sigma ) and cultured for additional 12 -- 24 hrs at 37 C .
After remove of the media with cellular debris , the cells were used for coating coverslips .
For immunostaining , neuronal cells on the coverslips were first fixed in PBS containing 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 12 hrs at 4 C and then incubated in a solution containing 4 % PFA and 0.4 % Triton X-100 at 4 C for 1 hr .
After washing with PBS three times , the cells were incubated with a blocking solution containing 1:30 normal goat serum , and subsequently incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ACDP antibody ( 1:3000 ) overnight at 4 C .
After extensive washing with 1 % goat serum PBS solution , the cells were incubated with an Alex 488 conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:100 in 1 % goat serum PBS solution , Molecular <termsem="SO:0000051"> Probes </term> ) for 3 hrs at room temperature .
Following final washes with 1 % goat serum PBS solution , the neuronal cells on the coverslips were cover-slipped with a glycerol-based anti-photobleach medium .
The cells were viewed under a confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) .
Images were captured with a CCD camera and acquired by the Scion Image software ( Scion Corporation , Frederick , MD ) .
