Diabetes Insipidus in Mice with a Mutation in Aquaporin-2 .
Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) is a disease characterized by failure of the kidney to concentrate urine in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to vasopressin .
Human kindreds with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have been found to harbor mutations in the <termsem="GO:0005000"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> vasopressin receptor </term> </term> 2 ( Avpr2 ) gene or the vasopressin-sensitive <termsem="GO:0015250"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> water channel </term> </term> aquaporin-2 ( Aqp2 ) gene .
Development of a treatment is rendered difficult due to the lack of a viable animal model .
Through forward genetic screening of ethylnitrosourea-mutagenized mice , we report the identification and characterization of a mouse model of NDI , with an F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene .
Unlike previously attempted murine models of NDI , our mice survive to adulthood and more exactly recapitulate the human disorder .
Previous in vitro experiments using renal cell lines suggest recessive Aqp2 mutations result in improper <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> of the mutant <termsem="GO:0015250"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> water pore </term> </term> .
Using these animals , we have directly proven this hypothesis of improper AQP2 <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocation </term> as the molecular defect in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in the intact organism .
Additionally , using a renal cell line we show that the mutated protein , AQP2-F204V , is <termsem="GO:0051235"> retained </term> in the endoplasmic reticulum and that this abnormal <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> can be rescued by wild-type protein .
This novel mouse model allows for further mechanistic studies as well as testing of pharmacological and gene therapies for NDI .
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) is a disease marked by excessive <termsem="GO:0060073"> urination </term> and thirst .
Normally , the hypothalamus <termsem="GO:0007600"> senses </term> situations where water is limited and <termsem="GO:0007165"> signals </term> to the kidney to increase water reabsorption from urine .
The <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecule <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> by the hypothalamus is arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , which <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to a specific protein on the surface of kidney cells , AVP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> ( AVPR2 ) .
AVP binding to its <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> on kidney cells begins a series of biochemical events that ultimately results in the insertion of a protein , aquaporin 2 ( AQP2 ) , into the outer surface of the kidney cell .
As its name suggests , AQP2 facilitates the reuptake of water from the urinary space into the cell , thus concentrating the urine and conserving water .
Congenital NDI is caused by mutations in either the <termsem="GO:0015250"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> water channel </term> </term> , AQP2 , or in the <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , AVPR2 .
While these mutations have been studied extensively in the lab , work in live animals has been very limited .
This report describes the first viable mouse model of NDI .
Previous models have been attempted by targeted mutation , i.e. , genes known to be involved in the disease have been altered in the mouse , a so-called reverse genetic approach .
Reverse genetic approaches have so far failed to <termsem="GO:0000003"> produce </term> a viable mouse model of NDI .
Here the authors take a forward genetic approach in which genes are mutated at random and animals are screened for disease-like properties .
As well as proving hypotheses that come from lab studies , this model opens the door to the testing of gene therapy or other therapies for treatment of NDI .
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus ( NDI ) is a disease characterized by excessive <termsem="GO:0060073"> urination </term> and thirst , despite normal production of the <termsem="GO:0003077"> antidiuretic </term> <termsem="GO:0005179"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hormone </term> </term> arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) [ 1 ] .
The inherited forms are either X-linked as a consequence of mutation of the Avpr2 gene [ 2 ] , or autosomal due to mutation of the Aqp2 gene [ 3 ] .
Aquaporin-2 ( AQP2 ) is a <termsem="GO:0046931"> <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> pore </term> </term> - forming </term> protein belonging to a family of <termsem="GO:0015250"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> water channels </term> </term> [ 4 ] , and it is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in collecting-duct principal cells in the kidney [ 5 ] .
Generally these proteins permit the <termsem="GO:0051234"> passage </term> of water through the plasma membrane ( PM ) of cells , several of which carry out this role specifically in the process of water reabsorption from urine in the kidney .
It has been established that aquaporins , although functional as a monomer , <termsem="GO:0051262"> tetramerize </term> before their insertion into the plasma membrane [ 4,6 ] .
Furthermore these proteins can also be differentially <termsem="GO:0006605"> targeted </term> to distinct regions of the PM ; for example , AQP2 is <termsem="GO:0006810"> routed </term> to the apical membrane of cells surrounding the collecting duct , whereas other aquaporins ( AQP3 or 4 ) are inserted into the basolateral face .
Unlike all other family members , AQP2 is not constitutively inserted into the plasma membrane .
Under basal conditions , the protein <termsem="GO:0051179"> resides </term> in subapical intracellular vesicles ; however , under conditions requiring <termsem="GO:0003092"> water retention </term> AQP2 <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocates </term> to the apical membrane , permitting water reabsorption [ 7,8 ] .
For this process to occur , AVP <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> its <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , AVPR2 , on the basolateral face of the collecting duct cells , leading to a rise in intracellular cAMP , ultimately resulting in phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 by <termsem="GO:0004691"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cAMP-dependent protein kinase </term> </term> [ 9 ] and its redistribution to the plasma membrane .
The importance of AQP2 redistribution has been highlighted by functional characterization of Aqp2 mutations resulting in severe NDI in humans [ 3,10 ] .
Recessive Aqp2 mutations are generally thought to <termsem="GO:0009058"> produce </term> an abnormally <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> and , in most instances , misfolded <termsem="GO:0015250"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> water pore </term> </term> that <termsem="GO:0050896"> responds </term> abnormally to an increase in cAMP [ 6,11 ] .
Furthermore , dominant mutations have been described and found to misroute both the mutant and the wild-type protein to the basolateral membrane [ 6,12 ] .
Several mouse models of diabetes insipidus have been <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> [ 13 -- 17 ] .
In an attempt to recapitulate human NDI , mice have been <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> with mutations in Aqp2 and Avpr2 [ 15,18 ] .
Yang and colleagues <termsem="GO:0000003"> created </term> a mouse with a T126M knock-in mutation in the Aqp2 gene .
Unexpectedly , homozygous mutant mice <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> within 6 d after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Interestingly , AVPR2-deficient male pups also <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> within the first week after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Together these models suggest that the mouse may be a highly sensitive organism with regard to <termsem="GO:0030104"> water homeostasis </term> , and is unable to survive with polyuria .
In a forward genetic screen , a mouse with an Aqp2 mutation was identified .
The purpose of this study was to characterize this murine model of recessive nephrogenic DI .
We now report a novel F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene .
This allele of Aqp2 was found to cause the first mouse model of NDI to survive past the first week of life .
Molecular analyses concluded that mutant AQP2 adopts a different <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> in renal collecting-duct cells , and was resistant to <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocation </term> induced by desmopressin , an <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonist </term> </term> of AVP .
In vitro studies using the Madin-Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line demonstrated an endoplasmic reticulum pattern for the mutant protein , and apparent resistance to <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocation </term> .
These data conclusively prove that autosomal recessive NDI is a consequence of improper AQP2 <termsem="GO:0006810"> routing </term> in the intact mammal .
In a forward genetic screen that used ethylnitrosourea ( ENU ) to induce mutations in a founder animal whose offspring were then screened for abnormal whole body <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolism </term> [ 19,20 ] , we found a family of mice that <termsem="GO:0060073"> urinated </term> and <termsem="GO:0042756"> drank </term> excessively .
Serum and urine analysis showed that plasma glucose levels were normal and there was no glucose in the urine ( unpublished data ) .
Hence , this was an example of diabetes insipidus .
The disorder in these mice segregated in a monogenic , autosomal recessive manner , making Aqp2 a candidate gene .
Sequencing of Aqp2 coding region of affected mice identified a thymine to guanine ( T to G ) transversion ( Figure 1A ) , which is predicted to lead to a valine for phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 204 of the protein ( F204V ) .
AQP2 is a six-transmembrane <termsem="GO:0015250"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> water channel </term> </term> , and F204 lies near the extracellular face of the sixth membrane spanning domain , a region rich in hydrophobic amino acids .
This and the other membrane-spanning domains are conserved among vertebrate species .
The phenylalanine at position 204 is particularly well conserved ( Figure 1B ) , not only among vertebrate AQP2 proteins , but also among others members of this family .
Aqp2F204V/F204V mice have dramatically increased urine production , in some cases producing an amount of urine in 24 h that exceeds their body weight , compared to their heterozygous or wild-type littermates .
Such loss of water would rapidly lead to dehydration were it not compensated by increased water intake .
Indeed , mutant mice also dramatically increase their water intake ( Figure 1C ) compared to their heterozygous or wild-type littermates .
This phenotype -- increased <termsem="GO:0060073"> urinary output </term> and water intake -- showed complete concordance with homozygosity of the F204V mutation in the 58 animals tested .
Diabetes insipidus can be defined as an inability to concentrate urine where appropriate .
Compared to wild-type or heterozygous littermates , Aqp2F204V/F204V mice produce very dilute urine ( Figure 1D ) .
Basal urine concentration in mutant mice is about 161 mOsm , compared to about 1,293 mOsm in wild-type mice ( p < 0.001 ) .
Normally , urine concentration is under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the hypothalamus , which , in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to hypovolemia or hypernatremia [ 21 ] , <termsem="GO:0046903"> secretes </term> AVP .
The synthetic AVP analog , 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin ( dDAVP ; also called desmopressin ) , is a potent <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonist </term> </term> of AVPR2 .
When administered to wild-type mice , dDAVP leads to a dramatic increase in urine concentration , from 1,293 to 5,885 mOsm ( 4.6-fold ; Figure 1D ) .
With similar treatment , mutant mice concentrate their urine to a lesser but still significant extent , from 161 to 470 mOsm ( 2.9-fold ) , indicating that these animals are not only unable to concentrate their urine properly but are also defective in their <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP .
The smaller <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP indicates some residual activity of the mutant AQP2 <termsem="GO:0015267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> channel </term> </term> , which must be sufficient to allow survival of the individual , in contrast to the T126M knock-in mouse [ 18 ] .
Multiple heterozygous <termsem="GO:0007618"> matings </term> <termsem="GO:0000003"> yielded </term> 101 animals , which appeared at a ratio of 26:49:26 , near the expected Mendelian wild type , heterozygote , and mutant frequencies , respectively , indicating that there is no reduced viability associated with this mutation .
Other than the increased urine production and water intake , there was no overt phenotype in mutant mice , save distended kidneys , which appeared variably in adult animals ( Figure 2A ) .
Although not specifically measured , mutant mice seem to have a normal lifespan .
The one animal that was followed lived to 18 mo , typical for animals in our colony .
Aqp2F204V/F204V mice suffer from severe hydronephrosis ( Figure 2A and 2B ) , presumably as a consequence of an inability to cope with the extreme polyuria .
We found distended kidneys in all Aqp2F204V/F204V mice ; however , the degree of inflation was variable in affected mice and worsened with age .
Severe hydronephrosis has previously been observed in double Aqp1/Aqp3 knock-out mice [ 17 ] , and appears at 6 wk .
Even at 4 wk , Aqp2F204V/F204V mice had hydronephrosis .
Histologic sections from Aqp2F204V/F204V mice demonstrated marked dilatation of the renal pelvis yet normal morphology of the ureter ( Figure 2C and 2D ) .
In particular , the muscularis propria was neither hypertrophied nor thinned .
There was the normal festooned appearance of the urothelium , and this transitional epithelium was of normal thickness .
There was thinning of the kidney as measured from renal capsule to renal pelvis .
However , the morphologic features of the glomeruli and proximal/distal tubules were unremarkable ( Figure 2D ) .
As shown previously [ 18,22 ] , immunoblotting revealed three different forms of AQP2 , due to different degrees and forms of <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylation </term> ( Figure 3A ) .
Previous reports have demonstrated that nonglycosylated protein appears as a 29 kDa band , while complex <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> protein runs as a smear between 35 and 45 kDa .
A short-lived intermediate form of 31 kDa representing core , high-mannose <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylation </term> of AQP2 is apparent from pulse-chase labeling experiments [ 22 ] .
Compared to that from the kidneys of wild-type animals , AQP2 from mutant animals was reduced in both the high molecular weight , diffuse form and the lowest molecular weight form , but enriched in the intermediate molecular weight form ( Figure 3A ) .
Heterozygous animals showed intermediate amounts of all three forms .
The nature of these <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> forms was revealed by <termsem="GO:0009056"> digestion </term> with endoglycosidase H , which specifically cleaves mannose-rich carbohydrate from the protein backbone .
Treatment of endogenous AQP2 from kidneys of wild-type , heterozygous , and mutant animals specifically affected the intermediate molecular weight form ( Figure 3B ) .
The presence of some mature <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> proteins ( 35 -- 45 kDa ) in Aqp2F204V/F204V mice presumably permits their survival compared to Aqp2T126M/T126M mice , and is consistent with a diminished <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP .
In humans , recessive alleles of Aqp2 are postulated to cause NDI because they do not properly <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocate </term> to the apical cell surface in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to AVP .
This postulate comes solely from in vitro studies in which mutant Aqp2 cDNAs corresponding to human disease mutations are <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> into kidney cell lines .
In general , such recessive alleles , when visualized immunocytochemically , fail to <termsem="GO:0051179"> localize </term> to AVP - <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> vesicles .
Rather , they get trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) .
Our mouse model of NDI affords the first opportunity to test this hypothesis in a mature animal .
As shown in Figure 4A ( top row of photomicrographs ) , AQP2 ( stained red ) normally <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the subapical region of collecting duct cells in kidneys of wild-type mice .
Upon <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with dDAVP , AQP2 <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocated </term> to or near the cell surface ( Figure 4A , second row ) .
In kidneys taken from mutant animals , however , AQP2 was <termsem="GO:0051179"> distributed </term> randomly throughout the cell in the basal state ( Figure 4A , third row ) , while AQP3 ( green ) appropriately <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the basolateral surface [ 23 ] .
Furthermore , upon dDAVP <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> , AQP2-F204V failed to <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocate </term> to the cell surface ( Figure 4A , bottom row ) .
To confirm these findings , the staining was repeated in kidneys taken from two further mice for each class , wild-type or mutant , with or without dDAVP treatment , with identical results .
To investigate the mechanism of defective <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocation </term> of AQP2-F204V , we turned to <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> of MDCK cells .
Stable cell lines <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> mouse wild-type AQP2 and AQP2-F204V were <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> .
Immunoblots of protein extracts from stable cell lines showed that MDCK cells recapitulate the <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylation </term> defect seen in mutant mice ( unpublished data ) .
The wild-type protein was again present in three different forms .
Cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> AQP2-F204V lacked the 35 -- 45 kDa form and were enriched in the core - <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> 31 kDa form .
In <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> , unstimulated MDCK cells , wild-type AQP2 ( stained green ) appeared in a punctate pattern <termsem="GO:0051179"> distributed </term> throughout the subapical region ( Figure 4B , left column photomicrographs ) , consistent with vesicular <termsem="GO:0051179"> compartmentalization </term> .
AQP2-F204V , on the other hand , appeared in a punctate but perinuclear pattern ( Figure 4B , third column ) .
Upon <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with forskolin , a <termsem="GO:0004691"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cAMP-dependent <termsem="GO:0030295"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protein kinase </term> </term> activator </term> </term> , wild-type AQP2 <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocated </term> to the apical surface of <termsem="GO:0030010"> polarized </term> MDCK cells ( Figure 4B , second column ) .
Along the z-axis , the perinuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of AQP2-F204V was clearly seen , and this <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> is not altered by forskolin ( Figure 4B , bottom row , two right columns ) .
The perinuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of AQP2-F204V is consistent with an ER <termsem="GO:0051179"> compartmentalization </term> .
To test the idea that AQP2-F204V <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> to the ER , we co-stained cells <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with Aqp2F204V ( cDNA ) for AQP2 and an ER marker , calnexin ( Figure 4C ) .
Colocalization of calnexin with AQP2 was investigated directly , and it was found that 80 % of all AQP2-F204V protein colocalized with calnexin .
The remaining 20 % appeared at the periphery of the ER , representing AQP2-F204V that had potentially progressed beyond the ER .
This `` ER escape '' was consistent with the small proportion of mature , complex <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> , AQP2-F204V in mutant kidneys ( see Figure 3A ) .
Animals heterozygous for the Aqp2F204V mutation were not affected in their urine production or urine osmolality ( see Figure 1C and 1D ) .
It has also been shown that a recessive NDI allele , AQP2-R187C , does not interact with wild-type protein in oocytes [ 24 ] , nor does it <termsem="GO:0051260"> homo-oligomerize </term> in MDCK cells [ 22 ] .
Therefore , kidneys from heterozygous animals were examined for evidence of two populations of AQP2 protein .
Surprisingly , immunohistochemical staining of kidney collecting ducts from Aqp2F204V / + mice revealed a pattern remarkably similar to wild type ( Figure 5A ) .
AQP2 <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocated </term> completely to the apical cell surface upon dDAVP <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> .
This wild-type staining pattern may simply reflect the fact that decreasing the amount of mutant protein by half makes it undetectable by immunocytochemistry .
Alternatively , the presence of wild-type protein may alter the localization of the mutant protein .
Indeed , Hendriks et al. proposed a `` piggy-back '' mechanism to explain the <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> of nonglycosylated subunits of AQP2 to the cell surface by <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> subunits [ 22 ] .
It has also been shown that wild-type AQP2 protein can rescue a <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocation </term> - defective mutant protein , AQP2-P262L , when the two are coexpressed in MDCK cells [ 25 ] .
In the collecting ducts from Aqp2F204V / + mice , the wild type may rescue the mutant protein as suggested by the <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular distribution </term> of AQP2 protein .
To test this idea , we first looked for an interaction between mutant and wild-type proteins in <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> MDCK cells ( Figure 5B ) .
MDCK cells stably <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> wild-type AQP2 were transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with GFP <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> constructs encoding GFP-tagged wild-type AQP2 , AQP2-F204V , or GFP alone .
Antibodies against GFP coimmunoprecipitated wild-type AQP2 when AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP was transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> , but not when GFP by itself was transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> into MDCK cells stably <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> wild-type AQP2 ( Figure 5B , upper blots ) .
Western blot of total membranes showed that wild-type AQP2 is equivalently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in all three cases ( Figure 5B , lower blots ) .
If wild-type and mutant proteins are indeed interacting in the cell , is this interaction sufficient to rescue the localization of mutant protein ?
To answer this question , we used MDCK cells stably <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with wild-type AQP2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> vector or with empty vector .
On top of these , we transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> AQP2-GFP or AQP2-F204V-GFP <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> constructs .
AQP2-GFP <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the apical surface upon forskolin <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> whether it was transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> into vector-only cells ( Figure 5C , upper left images ) or into wild-type AQP2 cells ( Figure 5C , upper right ) .
AQP2-F204V-GFP , when <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by transient <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> into vector only cells , showed a diffuse cytoplasmic <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> pattern ( Figure 5C , lower left ) .
When <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in wild-type AQP2 cells , however , AQP2-F204V-GFP <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the apical surface to varying degrees ( Figure 5C , lower right images [ i -- iii ] ) .
The lower right images of Figure 5C shows three cells from a single <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> .
The first is a nontransfected cell that shows the <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of the stably <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> wild-type AQP2 , which is apical upon forskolin <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> .
The next two show <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of both the stable wild-type AQP2 and the transient AQP2-F204V-GFP .
In cell ( ii ) , <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of wild-type AQP2 was indistinguishable from AQP2-F204V-GFP ; both were apical upon forskolin <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> .
Although the effect was subtle in cell ( iii ) , AQP2-F204V-GFP was partly <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the apical surface .
Generally , the <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of AQP2-F204V-GFP was clearly more apical when wild-type AQP2 was also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> .
To confirm these results biochemically , we <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> the same cell lines ( wild-type AQP2 or vector ) with F204V-GFP , <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylated </term> surface proteins after forskolin <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> , and precipitated the <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylated </term> proteins ( Figure 5D ) .
AQP2-F204V-GFP is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> approximately equally in both cell lines ( Figure 5D , total cells ) , but is <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylated </term> only when wild-type AQP2 is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> ( Figure 5D , surface <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylated </term> ) .
Since only cell surface proteins are accessible to biotin , these results indicate that AQP2-F204V is <termsem="GO:0006810"> transported </term> to the cell surface when wild-type AQP2 is present , but not on its own .
Aqp2F204/F204V mice are viable and <termsem="GO:0040007"> grow </term> and <termsem="GO:0000003"> reproduce </term> normally .
They are , however , severely defective in their ability to concentrate urine , leading to increased <termsem="GO:0060073"> urine output </term> and water <termsem="GO:0007631"> intake </term> , thus making them the first mouse model of NDI to survive to maturity .
In humans , NDI is caused by mutations in Avpr2 or Aqp2 .
Knockout of the X-linked Avpr2 gene in mice [ 15 ] gave an NDI-like phenotype in male , hemizygous neonates , but the phenotype could not be assessed in adults as the mice <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> within 1 wk of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
The adult heterozygous females showed a mild tendency toward increased <termsem="GO:0060073"> urinary output </term> and water <termsem="GO:0007631"> intake </term> and decreased urine osmolality .
Knockout of the mouse Aqp2 gene has not been reported .
A knock-in of a human disease-causing mutation ( T126M ) , however , has been made [ 18 ] .
These mice have a severe urine-concentrating defect resulting in dehydration and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> within 1 wk of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Curiously , AQP2-T126M does <termsem="GO:0051179"> localize </term> properly in at least a subset of cells .
The grossly abnormal collecting duct morphology makes it impossible to pinpoint the molecular defect in these knock-in mice .
The T126M knock-in clearly shows that Aqp2 is an essential gene [ 18 ] .
The fact that our mice survive shows either that AQP2-F204V possesses some residual <termsem="GO:0006833"> water transporting </term> ability or that there are AVP-independent pathways for water reabsorption .
Residual activity of AQP2-F204V is likely , as mutant animals show some small <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP , although dDAVP-stimulated urine osmolality remains quite low .
Immunostaining of kidney shows that AQP2-F204V does not efficiently <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> water , because it fails to <termsem="GO:0051179"> localize </term> to the apical cell surface after dDAVP treatment .
Some residual activity of AQP2 would imply that some small , undetectable portion of the mutant protein is getting to the cell surface .
The surface <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylation </term> experiment ( Figure 5D ) suggests that no mutant protein gets to the surface , but this does not necessarily reflect the situation in vivo .
While this small fraction of protein may not be detectable by immunofluorescence , Western blotting shows that some mutant protein does progress beyond the ER ( 35 -- 45 kDa species in Figure 3A ) .
Compared to wild-type , mutant protein is enriched in the high-mannose , core - <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> form ( 31 kDa ) and deficient in nonglycosylated ( 29 kDa ) and complex <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> ( 35 -- 45 kDa ) forms .
The presence of a reduced but detectable amount of protein in the 35 -- 45 kDa range indicates that mutant protein is <termsem="GO:0006810"> transported </term> out of the ER , but with greatly reduced efficiency .
Colocalization of AQP2-F204V with the ER protein calnexin in <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> MDCK cells shows that , while most of the mutant protein is trapped in the ER , some does progress beyond the ER .
Diminished <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP , diminished abundance of mature <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> protein in mutant animals , and the transport of a fraction of mutant protein beyond the ER in MDCK cells are all consistent with the notion that AQP2-F204V misfolding is limited and that it may retain some residual <termsem="GO:0006833"> water transporting </term> activity .
Evidently this residual activity is sufficient for the viability and <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> of mutant animals .
Reduced efficiency in exiting the ER may explain why AQP2-F204V is enriched in the 31 kDa high-mannose <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> form .
The high-mannose core oligosaccharide is added in the ER and is later <termsem="GO:0043412"> modified </term> and elaborated in the Golgi apparatus [ 26 ] .
The increase in the high-mannose <termsem="GO:0043413"> glycosylated </term> form of AQP2-F204V may simply reflect its prolonged presence in the ER and exposure to <termsem="GO:0004576"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> oligosaccharyl transferase </term> </term> .
While improper <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of AQP2 explains the phenotype of homozygous mutant mice , the complete lack of a phenotype in heterozygous mice is more difficult to explain .
Physiologically , heterozygous mice have no symptoms ( see Figure 1C ) , and they are indistinguishable from wild type on immunostaining of kidneys ( Figure 5A ) .
The presence of 50 % of the normal amount of wild-type protein may explain the lack of symptoms , but it can not explain the lack of any ER - <termsem="GO:0051235"> retained </term> mutant protein .
Rather , the phenotype of the Aqp2F204V / + animals suggests that the mutant protein is being rescued by the wild-type protein .
Indeed , de Mattia et al. ( 26 ) have demonstrated that one recessive allele of Aqp2 , P262L , does not properly <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocate </term> when <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by itself in MDCK cells , but that in the presence of wild-type protein , it <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> normally .
The same mechanism seems to apply in vivo with Aqp2F204V / + mice .
In support of this , AQP2-F204V can interact with wild-type AQP2 ( Figure 5B ) , and when coexpressed with wild-type protein , AQP2-F204V can reach the cell surface ( Figure 5C bottom right panel and 5D ) .
Although it has been demonstrated that a recessive allele ( encoding AQP2-R187C ) of NDI fails to interact with wild-type AQP2 [ 6 ] , here we show that AQP2-F204V does interact with the wild-type protein , presumably as part of heterotetramers , and represents a rescuable allele , both in vitro and in vivo .
Immunostaining the kidneys of homozygous Aqp2F204V/F204V mice shows that the mutant - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> collecting duct cells can not mediate water reabsorption , because it fails to insert into the apical plasma membrane in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP .
This is this first in vivo proof of a long-standing hypothesis that comes from in vitro studies with recessive Aqp2 mutations .
<termsem="GO:0009294"> Transfection </term> into MDCK cells of any of several Aqp2 mutations corresponding to recessive human alleles shows abnormal <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> [ 25 ] , [ 27 ] and failure to appropriately <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocate </term> to the plasma membrane .
Thus , misfolding , <termsem="GO:0051235"> retention </term> in the ER , and failure to <termsem="GO:0006810"> translocate </term> in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to dDAVP were proposed as the mechanism for autosomal recessive NDI .
Here we not only prove this hypothesis but also <termsem="GO:0000003"> establish </term> a useful model for human NDI .
This mouse model of NDI based on an Aqp2 allele that can be rescued provides the opportunity to test therapies , including gene therapy , that may <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> proper <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of ENU mice and housing .

Urine measurements .
Total <termsem="GO:0060073"> urine output </term> was measured by separately housing adult mice in Nalgene <termsem="GO:0008152"> Metabolic </term> Cages ( Minimitter , Bend , Oregon , United States ) for 2 -- 3 d and collecting urine every 24 h period .
Urine osmolalities were determined using an Osmometer ( Osmette 5004 ; Precision Systems , Natick , Massachusetts , United States ) .
Urine concentrating experiments were carried out by intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP ( 0.4 g/kg ) .
Mice were injected twice with dDAVP , once at time 0 and again at 30 min .
Urine was collected at the start of the experiment and 30 min after the second injection .
Kidney membrane preparation .
Whole mouse kidneys were homogenized in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 350 mM sucrose , and 5 mM EDTA containing <termsem="GO:0030414"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protease </term> </term> inhibitors </term> </term> ( Sigma-Aldrich , # P-8340 ) in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer .
The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C .
Pelleted membranes were resuspended in the same buffer , and protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay .
Immunoblotting .
Kidney membrane fractions ( 60 g ) were resolved on a 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
Membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) , followed by an overnight incubation ( at 4 C ) with AQP2 polyclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , California , United States ; #sc -9882 ) .
Membranes were washed in TBST then incubated with HRP - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> donkey anti-goat antibody .
Membranes were washed further in TBST and bands were visualized using ECL reagent ( Amersham Biosciences , Little Chalfont , United Kingdom ) .
Endoglycosidase <termsem="GO:0009056"> digestion </term> .
Kidney membranes ( 60 g ) were incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 5.5 ) , 0.1 % SDS , and 50 mM -mercaptoethanol , heated to 100 C for 5 min , then cooled .
Endoglycosidase H ( 0.01 units ; Sigma-Aldrich ) was added and incubated at 37 C for 2 h .
The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer .
Total reactants were immunoblotted as described above .
Coimmunoprecipitation and <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylation </term> in MDCK cells .
MDCK cells stably <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> wild-type AQP2 ( <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> on 10-cm plates ) were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with pEGFP-wild-type AQP2 , pEGFP-AQP2-F204V , or vector alone .
The cells were homogenized in 10 mM Tris ( pH 7.4 ) , 1 mM EDTA , and 250 mM sucrose 40 h later .
The clarified supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 g for 30 min .
Pelleted membranes were resuspended in the same buffer but containing 4 % sodium deoxycholate and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. From the dissolved membranes , a 30 l sample was removed and used as the total membrane fraction .
The remaining membranes were diluted with 600 l of the homogenization buffer , and incubated with 1 l of GFP antisera ( Invitrogen , # 46 -- 0092 ) and protein A/G sepharose .
Following overnight incubation , the precipitated proteins were washed in RIPA buffer and finally boiled in 50 l of Laemmli buffer .
Half of the total membrane and the IP fractions were processed for immunoblotting .
Cell surface <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylation </term> was performed in a similar manner .
However , pEGFP-AQP2-F204V , was <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> into MDCK cells stably <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> wild-type AQP2 and cells made stable with vector alone .
Twenty-four hours post - <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> , cells were <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulated </term> with forskolin , trypsinized , resuspended in 1 ml of PBS ( 2.5  106 cells/ml ) , and incubated with 0.5 mg of NHS-PEO4-biotin ( Pierce Biotechnology ) for 30 min at room temperature .
Cells were washed once in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) and three times in PBS , after which membranes were purified and solubilized as described above .
Solubilized membranes were incubated with 20 l of immobilized streptavidin ( Pierce Biotechnology ) for 2 h at 4 C .
Finally the precipitated proteins were washed in RIPA buffer and boiled in 50 l of Laemmli buffer .
Total cells and the <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotinylated </term> precipitates were immunoblotting using an antibody to AQP2 .
Kidney immunohistochemistry .
Whole mouse kidneys were fixed in 10 % phosphate-buffered formalin for 24 h. Kidneys were embedded in paraffin , and 5-m sections were prepared .
Following antigen retrieval using 10 mM sodium citrate ( pH 8 ) for 10 min at 98 C , sections were sequentially probed , first for AQP3 and then for AQP2 .
Sections were incubated in 5 % donkey serum and then in goat anti-AQP3 antibody ( 1:100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; #sc -9885 ) .
Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with AlexaFluor 488 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> donkey anti-goat antibody ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , Oregon , United States ) .
The slides were subsequently blocked in 5 % chicken serum , incubated with a rabbit anti-AQP2 antibody ( 1:250 ; USB , Cleveland , Ohio , United States ; #A3000 -- 06 ) , which was detected with a AlexaFluor 594 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> chicken anti-rabbit antibody ( 1:500 ; Molecular Probes ) .
The sections were stained with DAPI and mounted in Vectashield ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , California , United States ) .
Immunocytochemistry on MDCK cells .
MDCK stable cell lines <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> vector alone , wild-type AQP2 , or AQP2-F204V ( and in some cases transiently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> a GFP construct ) were <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> on fibronectin-coated coverslips until tight junctions <termsem="GO:0022607"> formed </term> .
Cells were treated with or without 150 M forskolin for 90 min , and fixed in methanol at  20 C .
Subsequently , cells were washed and permeabilized in 0.2 % Triton X-100 for 5 min , and sequentially probed for AQP2 and organelle markers for either the PM or the ER .
AQP2 was detected using goat anti-AQP2 ( 1:100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; #sc -9882 ) and a 1:200 dilution of AlexaFluor 488 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> donkey anti-goat secondary antibody .
The PM and ER were probed using mouse anti- <termsem="GO:0005391"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Na + / K + - ATPase </term> </term> ( Upstate , Waltham , Massachusetts , United States ) or rabbit anti-calnexin ( Stressgen Biotechnology , Victoria , British Columbia , Canada ) antibodies and the secondary antibodies , Cy3 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> goat anti-mouse ( 1:200 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , Pennsylvania , United States ) or AlexaFluor 594 - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> chicken anti-rabbit ( 1:200 ) respectively .
Cells were washed in PBS , counterstained with DAPI , and mounted in Vectashield .
In experiments in which GFP fusions were used , AQP2 was probed using the antibody combination used for kidney immunohistochemistry in order to detect the AQP2 at 594 nm , to distinguish between the GFP fusion proteins .
