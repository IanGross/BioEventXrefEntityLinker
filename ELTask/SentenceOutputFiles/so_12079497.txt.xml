Embryonic stem cells and mice expressing different GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> for multiple non-invasive reporter usage within a single animal .
Non-invasive autofluorescent reporters have revolutionized lineage labeling in an array of different organisms .
In recent years green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) from the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequoria Victoria has gained popularity in mouse <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> and <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting regimes [ 1 ] .
It offers several advantages over conventional <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - based reporters , such as lacZ and alkaline phosphatase , in that its visualization does not require a chromogenic substrate and can be realized in vivo .
We have previously demonstrated the utility and developmental neutrality of enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and mice [ 2 ] .
In this study we have used embryonic stem ( ES ) cell-mediated transgenesis to test the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein ( ECFP ) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein ( EYFP ) , two <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> and spectrally distinct color <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild type </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> ) GFP .
We have also tested DsRed1 , the novel red fluorescent protein reporter recently cloned from the Discostoma coral by virtue of its <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> to GFP .
To this end , we have established lines of ES cells together with viable and fertile mice having widespread expression of either the ECFP or EYFP GFP - <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> reporters .
However , we were unable to generate equivalent DsRed1 lines , suggesting that DsRed1 is not developmentally neutral or that <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> expression can not be sustained constitutively .
Balanced ( diploid < - > diploid ) and polarized ( tetraploid < - > diploid ) chimeras comprising combinations of the ECFP and EYFP ES cells and/or embryos , demonstrate that populations of cells expressing each individual reporter can be distinguished within a single animal .
GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> reporters are unique in allowing non-invasive multi-spectral visualization in live samples .
The ECFP and EYFP-expressing <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> ES cells and mice that we have generated provide sources of cells and tissues for combinatorial , double-tagged recombination experiments , chimeras or transplantations .
The ease of manipulating its <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> has helped establish the mouse as the premier model organism for mammalian <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> studies .
Both directed and random <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutagenesis </term> approaches , including the technologies of transgenesis and <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting in ES cells , have become commonplace .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genetically </term> manipulated mice , often <termsem="SO:0000046"> incorporating </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - based reporters , are frequently being used to model and understand mammalian development and disease processes .
Fluorescent protein reporters currently represent a superior alternative to other <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - based reporters such as the bacterial lacZ or human placental alkaline phosphatase in that their visualization is non-invasive , and as such does not require chromogenic substrates .
Fluorescence can be monitored in real-time in vivo and in situ , and has the added advantage in that it can be quantified .
The prototype fluorescent protein reporter is green fluorescent protein ( GFP , reviewed in [ 3 ] ) , which is derived from the bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea Victoria [ 1 ] .
Green fluorescent <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild type </term> GFP ( wtGFP ) with improved thermostability and fluorescence emission , including enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP , [ 4 ] ) , and mMGFP [ 5 ] , have gained popularity for use in mice .
Recently however , several additional <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutants </term> of wtGFP , with altered excitation and emission spectral profiles ( i.e. fluoresce in colors other than green ) , as well as improved thermostability and fluorescence , have been described [ 4,6 ] .
Dual color imaging of several GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> proteins is a very attractive prospect and has become a standard procedure in cell biology [ 7,8 ] .
It has also recently been demonstrated in a subset of cells within the central nervous system ( CNS ) of mice using both <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> and viral infection-based approaches [ 9,10 ] .
We therefore wished to investigate the feasibility of non-invasive multiple reporter imaging in mice , and as a first step we wanted to ascertain whether we could establish viable and fertile mice with widespread expression of GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> reporters .
We tested several of the available wtGFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> for developmental neutrality and stability of widespread expression .
An ES cell-mediated <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> approach was used to evaluate the Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein ( ECFP ) and Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein ( EYFP ) wtGFP spectral <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> [ 4,11 ] .
ECFP harbors six <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitutions </term> ( Y66W , F64L , S65T , N146I , M153T , V163A ) as compared to GFP , whereas EYFP harbors four ( S65G , V68L , S72A and T203Y ) .
In addition to increasing the quantum yield and solubility of the proteins these <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> shift the spectral profiles of the translation products [ 4,11 ] .
A breakthrough in the availability of spectrally distinct autofluorescent proteins came with the cloning of six anthozoan fluorescent proteins all having 20 -- 30 % identity to wtGFP [ 12 ] .
Of these , DsRed1 ( referred to as drFP585 by Matz et al. , [ 12 ] ) , a 28 kDa protein isolated from the IndoPacific sea anemone Discosoma sp , posseses the longest excitation ( 558 nm ) and emission ( 583 nm ) wavelength maxima known for a <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> autofluorescent protein .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of DsRed1 has recently been <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> and optimized for high levels of expression in mammalian cells by the introduction of 144 silent <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> changes </term> corresponding to human <termsem="SO:0000360"> codon </term> usage preferences .
We therefore also tested this novel red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) in ES cells and mice .
<termsem="SO:0000155"> Plasmids </term> were constructed for driving widespread expression of each of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - based fluorescent protein ( FP ) reporters and were tested in ES cell-mediated <termsem="SO:0000902"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transgenics </term> </term> as described previously [ 2 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000902"> Transgenic </term> ES cells exhibiting robust expression of ECFP or EYFP were obtained at the same frequency as we had previously obtained for EGFP .
Cells expressing one or other of the two GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> reporters were clearly distinguishable within a mixed population ( Fig. 1a ,1 b ,1 c ,1 d ) .
Interestingly however we were unable to recover <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> expressing DsRed1 at the same frequency as for the GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> reporters after electroporation and selection under identical conditions .
Indeed the DsRed1 expressing <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> that we were able to recover did not retain their characteristic ES cell morphology , usually appearing smaller and more spherical ( Fig. 1e and 1f ) , or occasionally spindle shaped ( data not shown ) .
Unlike the fluorescence produced by the GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> which was evenly distributed throughout the cells , the DsRed signal was never homogenous .
Red fluorescence was often aggregated in what appeared to be perinuclear regions of the cytoplasm .
Similar observations have been made by Furuta and colleagues when they used recombinant sindbis virus for the labeling of dendrites and axons within the CNS of adult mice [ 10 ] .
In order to generate a DsRed <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> that may be amenable to use in ES cells and mice , we recently <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduced </term> various <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> that direct nuclear localization to the DsRed <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> .
However , again we were unable to generate ES cells or mice exhibiting robust widespread reporter activity ( A.-K.H. and V.E. Papaioannou , unpublished observations ) .

Scale bars represent 100 m .
Two ECFP + and two EYFP + <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> exhibiting robust fluorescence were used to generate chimeras through ES cell < - > morula stage embryo aggregation [ 13 ] .
All four ES cell lines transmitted through the germline , leading to the establishment of , CK4/ECFP and CK6/ECFP , two strains of mice having cyan fluorescent protein expression and , YC5/EYFP and 2A4/EYFP , two strains having widespread yellow fluorescent protein expression .
In these mice the respective FP expression is constituitive , starting at preimplantation stages and continuing through postimplantation embryogenesis to adulthood ( Fig. 2 ) .
One line expressing each color was chosen for further analysis and breeding to homozygosity .
The availability of homozygous animals demonstrated that both reporter <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression and the site of <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> <termsem="SO:0000046"> integration </term> were developmentally neutral .

( j ) CK6/ECFP ( <termsem="SO:0000902"> TG </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> mouse left , YC5/EYFP ( <termsem="SO:0000902"> TG </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ) <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> mouse right .
( k ) higher maginification view of the tails of the mice in i and j. Zygotic expression of the FP <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenes </term> is clearly evident by the blastocyst stage ( Fig. 2a ,2 b ,2 c ,2 d ) and remains widespread thereafter ( Fig. 2 ) .
Figure 2 demonstrates that ECFP + embryos can easily be distinguished from EYFP + embryos and from non - <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> non-fluorescent embryos from preimplantation stages ( Fig. 2a ,2 b ,2 c ,2 d ) to postimplantation stages ( Fig. 2e ,2 f ,2 g ,2 h ) .
Additionally adult mice can also be discriminated on the basis of the color of their fluorescence ( Fig. 2i ,2 j ,2 k ) .
Even though our RFP <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> ES cell lines failed to maintain strong uniform expression with in vitro passage , we selected three lines exhibiting the most robust expression for making chimeras , in order to ascertain whether we could achieve , or possibly recover , RFP expression in animals .
Cells were flow sorted prior to aggregation so as to enrich for RFP expression .
Even though they had lost their characteristic ES cell morphology all three RFP + ES cell lines went gemline as detected by coat color and PCR for the DsRed1 <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( data not shown ) .
However expression of the RFP reporter could not be detected in any organ of adult mice nor in embryos ( data not shown ) .
This suggests that the DsRed1 RFP reporter was unable to recapitulate the expression profile of the <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> / <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> combination employed .
Therefore it appears that GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> reporters are more versatile with respect to their application in mice .
We produced double FP-tagged chimeras in order to assess whether the ECFP and EYFP reporters could be co-visualized within the same animal .
The first series of chimeras were generated through the aggregation of tetraploid embryos with FP + ES cells ( or embryos ) of the complementary color .
The procedure is schematized in Fig. 3a .
It is evident that the expression of the two FPs can easily be discerned in these double <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> embryos where the diploid , embryo-proper compartment is ECFP + and the tetraploid extraembryonic compartment is EYFP + ( Fig. 3b ,3 c ,3 d ,3 e ,3 f ) .
Secondly we investigated reporter co-visualization in balanced adult chimeras comprised of both ECFP + and EYFP + compartments .
These were generated through the aggregation of diploid embryos with diploid embryos ( or ES cells ) of the complementary color .
The aggregated components of the chimera from which each organ originated is schematized in the top right of each panel in Fig. 4 .
These chimeric adult organs demonstrate that the ECFP + and EYFP + cells comprising these chimeras can easily be discerned ( Fig. 4 ) .
It can therefore be envisaged that two different FP colors could be used in the construction of chimeras so as to tag both <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> and <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild type </term> lineages .
Dual non-invasive reporter visualization in chimeric embryos generated by tetraploid < - > diploid aggregation .
In all panels the tetraploid compartment is yellow/green fluorescent ( EYFP + ) and the diploid is blue/cyan fluorescent ( ECFP + ) .

Sandwich aggregations were made using either ECFP + ( diploid ) morulae or ES cells .
( b-d ) anterior view of an E7 .5 double-tagged polarized chimera dissected free of its deciduum and therefore missing primary giant cells and parietal endoderm .
Here the epiblast ( lower half of embryo ) and its derivatives are ECFP + whereas the extraembryonic ectoderm , the visceral endoderm and trophoblast are EYFP + ( upper half or embryo ) .

( c ) dark field image taken through an ECFP filter .
( d ) dark field double exposure image acquired by consecutively using ECFP and EYFP filters .
( e ) dark field double filter exposure of an E9 chimera dissected free of all extraembryonic membranes except for a small piece of yolk sac ( lower left ) .
The embryo itself is ECFP + whereas the yolk sac both ECFP + and EYFP + in the mesoderm and endoderm respectively .
A small number of EYFP + cells are also observed in the ventral midline of the embryo ( arrowhead ) .
This observation has been noted previously in tetraploid chimeras , and is presumed to represent a small population of visceral endoderm cells that fail to be displaced by the definitive endoderm at earlier stages .
( f ) dark field double filter exposure of an E10 chimera .
The embryo is exclusively ECFP + whereas its placenta ( to the left of the embryo ) is predominantly EYFP + .
The labyrinthine trophoblast layer of the placenta comprises both ECFP + and EYFP + cells .

( a-c ) heart and pancreas from double-tagged double-compartment adult chimeras .
( a ) view of the surface of an adult heart .
( b ) close-up surface view of ventricle of a chimeric heart generated by aggregation of two diploid morulae , one hemizygous for the CK6/ECFP ( ECFP + ) <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> and the other hemizygous for the YC5/EYFP ( EYFP + ) <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> .
The regions of yellow/green and cyan fluorescence are clearly mutually exclusive .
The striations in the fields of fluorescence represent the proliferative zones present within the ventricle .
( c ) chimeric pancreas generated by aggregation of a morula hemizygous for the YC5/EYFP <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> with CK6/ECFP ES cells .
The restricted fields of fluorescence represent the proliferative zones present within the pancreas .
( d ) liver from a double-tagged triple-compartment adult chimera .
A non-fluorescent morula was aggregated with two clumps of ES cells , one carrying the CK6/ECFP <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( ECFP + ) and the other carrying the YC5/EYFP <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( EYFP + ) .
An ECFP + vessel has clonally proliferated and infiltrated the liver lobe ( top ) .
Note that unlike in heart and pancreas there appears to be more interspersed blue/cyan vs green/yellow fluorescence present in the liver , possibly reflecting greater cell intermingling during the genesis of this organ .
From these observations we conclude that the blue-shifted ECFP , and the red-shifted EYFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> of wtGFP are both amenable to use in mice .
Also since we have established lines of viable and fertile mice having widespread FP expression we have demonstrated that ECFP and EYFP represent developmentally neutral reporters .
Since we were unable to obtain ES cells , embryos or mice with widespread expression of a RFP ( DsRed1 ) we conclude that this reporter is not developmentally neutral or that its expression can not be sustained at levels high enough for detection , and as such is not as versatile as other <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - based fluorescent reporters .
ECFP and EYFP can be distinguished on the basis of their unique non-overlapping spectral profiles , and chimeras comprised of ECFP and EYFP tagged compartments demonstrate that the two reporters can be simultaneously non-invasively visualized within the same embryo or adult organ .
Therefore it should be possible to use flow cytometry to isolate cells expressing either or both of the reporters from embryos or adult organs [ 14 ] .
These two reporters can also be used to create pairs of donors and acceptors for in vivo fluorescence energy transfer ( FRET ) [ 15 ] .
Since the emission profiles of ECFP and EYFP are the least overlapping of all the usable GFP <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> , these ECFP and EYFP currently represent the best combination for co-visualization and for use in multi-spectral double-tagged <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> , chimeric and/or in vivo FRET experiments ( reviewed in [ 16 ] ) .
These experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring multiple FP reporters non-invasively within a single animal , and have shown the developmental neutrality of the FP reporters employed .
This should pave the way for novel strategies designed to incorporate the use of compound <termsem="SO:0000902"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transgenics </term> </term> or tissue recombination or chimeric analyses where several compartments are to be tagged .
This technology should provide new possibilities in manipulating the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , and non-invasively studying the consequences .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> encoding ECFP , EYFP and DsRed were amplified from <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> pECFP , pEYFP and pDsRed1-N1 ( Clontech , Inc. ) by PCR using HiFi Taq Polymerase ( Invitrogen ) .
For ECFP and EYFP <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> used were GFP-L ( 5 ' - TTG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGG TGA GC ) and GFP-R ( 5 ' - TTG AAT TCT TAC TTG TAC AGC TCG TCC ) , for dsRed <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> were red-L ( 5 ' - TTG AAT TCG CCA CCA TGG TGC GCT C ) and red-R ( 5 ' - TTG AAT TCT TAC GCT ACA GCT ACA GGA ACA GGT G ) .

To construct <termsem="SO:0000440"> vectors </term> driving ubiquitous <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> expression in ES cells and mice , the PCR amplified <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> were digested with EcoRI and <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> into the EcoRI <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> of pCAGGS [ 18 ] to generate pCX-ECFP , pCX-EYFP and pCX-DsRed .

This <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> / <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> combination has previously been shown to drive strong and widespread <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> expression in ES cells , embryos and adult mice [ 18,19 ] .
R1 ES cells [ 20 ] were maintained under standard culture conditions in the presence of LIF , as described previously [ 21 ] .
20 g of SalI linearized pCX-ECFP , pCX-EYFP or pCX-DsRed1 was co-electroporated into 2  107 cells with 5 -- 10 g of <termsem="SO:0000988"> circular </term> pPGKPuro [ 22 ] .
This provided transient drug resistance which could be used as a selection for obtaining individual colonies .
Selection was applied 24 hours after electroporation and maintained for 5 days , thereafter cells were propagated in in the absence of selection .
Fluorescent colonies were picked into 96-well plates , expanded and archived as described previously ( [ 2 ] .

ES cell lines exhibiting robust <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> expression in vitro were assessed in vivo for the spatiotemporal extent of <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> expression and their developmental potential in chimeras produced by aggregation with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild type </term> tetraploid ICR embryos so as to produce completely ES cell-derived embryos , as described previously [ 20,23 ] .

Photographs of live samples , freshly dissected in PBS ( [ 24 ] were taken on a Leica MZFLIII stereo dissecting microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics .
Filter sets used were : excitation 436/20 nm , dichroic mirror 455 nm , barrier 480/40 nm for ECFP , excitation 500/20 nm , dichroic mirror 515 nm , barrier 535/30 nm for EYFP and excitation 540/25 nm , dichroic mirror 565 nm , barrier 605/55 for DsRed .
Adult mice were anaesthetized with avertin .
They were then placed on the stage of a stereo dissecting microscope ( Leica MZFLIII ) from which the objective had been removed , such that they were illuminated using the epifluorescence optics ( lamp and excitation filters ) .
Photographs were taken using a Nikon FE10 35 mm SLR camera fitted with individual emission filters .
