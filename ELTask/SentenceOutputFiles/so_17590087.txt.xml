<termsem="SO:0000045"> Deletion </term> at ITPR1 Underlies Ataxia in Mice and Spinocerebellar Ataxia 15 in Humans .
We observed a severe autosomal recessive movement disorder in mice used within our laboratory .
We pursued a series of experiments to define the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> lesion underlying this disorder and to identify a cognate disease in humans with <termsem="SO:0000041"> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> </term> at the same <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
Through linkage and <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> analysis we show here that this disorder is caused by a homozygous in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> 18 - <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> in Itpr1 ( Itpr118/18 ) , encoding inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 .
A previously reported spontaneous Itpr1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in mice causes a phenotype identical to that observed here .
In both models in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> within Itpr1 leads to a decrease in the normally high level of Itpr1 expression in cerebellar Purkinje cells .
Spinocerebellar ataxia 15 ( SCA15 ) , a human autosomal dominant disorder , maps to the <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> containing ITPR1 ; however , to date no causal <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> had been identified .
Because ataxia is a prominent feature in Itpr1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice , we performed a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> at ITPR1 may be the cause of SCA15 .
We show here that heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of the 5  part of the ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , encompassing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 1 -- 10 , 1 -- 40 , and 1 -- 44 in three studied families , underlies SCA15 in humans .
We have identified a spontaneous in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion mutation </term> in the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> Itpr1 that causes a recessive movement disorder in mice .
In an attempt to define whether any similar disease occurs in humans we performed a literature search for diseases linked to the human <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> region </term> containing ITPR1 .
We identified the disease spinocerebellar ataxia 15 as linked to this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
High-density <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> analysis of affected members from three families revealed that disease in these patients was caused by <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of a large <termsem="SO:0000001"> portion </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> containing ITPR1 .
We show here that this <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> results in a dramatic reduction in ITPR1 in cells from these patients .
These data show convincingly that ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> underlies spinocerebellar ataxia 15 in humans .
The use of forward genetics to define novel <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> of interest in human disease has become increasingly viable with the implementation of large-scale <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutagenesis </term> programs .
Prior to these initiatives this work was carried out in part by the investigation of spontaneous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> that cause disorders in mouse breeding colonies .
Careful observation of these serendipitous events has led to the establishment and study of many in vivo disease models [ 3 ] .
During the generation of a knockout line of mice we noted an early movement disorder that was inherited independently of targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> transmission .
We embarked on a series of experiments to identify the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> lesion underlying this movement disorder and to identify a cognate disease and corresponding <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in humans .
Here we describe this effort and the discovery of <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> at the ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> as a cause of this disorder in mice and of spinocerebellar ataxia 15 ( SCA15 ) in humans .
During the generation of a line of mice with knockout of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> Park7 we noted an early movement disorder that was inherited independently of targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> transmission .
Our initial observations suggested the affected mice suffered from an apparently paroxysmal movement disorder , often induced by touch .
The abnormal movements occurred predominantly below the cervical level , and the disorder appeared progressive .
At initial examination , a human movement disorder specialist ( K. G.-H . )
likened the disorder to episodic intermittent ataxia or kinesiogenic paroxysmal dystonia and predicted the involvement of an ion channel <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the etiology .
Affected mice presented at approximately postnatal day 14 , and survival time without weaning was on average 4 wk after onset .
Breeding experiments suggested that the observed disorder was inherited in an autosomal recessive manner .
To map the <termsem="SO:0000001"> location </term> of the disease-causing lesion , we performed <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide linkage analysis using strain-specific <termsem="SO:0000694"> single <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> polymorphisms </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> ) at 120 <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> across the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
Analysis of these data showed a single <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> with significant linkage to disease , providing a two-point LOD score of 5.13 at marker 20 .
MMHAP85FLG2 on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 6qE1 .
The linked <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> suggested the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> had occurred on the 129x1/SvJ background ( Figure S1 ) .
Literature searches revealed that among disease lines mapped to 6qE1 , the spontaneous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> opt mouse displays a strikingly similar presentation to that described here [ 1 ] .
The underlying <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> lesion causing the opt phenotype is a homozygous in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 43 and 44 of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> Itpr1 ( Itpr1opt/opt ) , encoding inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 ( Itpr1 ) .
Sequencing of all <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> and <termsem="SO:0001421"> <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> -- <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> boundaries </term> of Itpr1 in affected mice from the current study revealed a single <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> within Itpr1 : a novel in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> of 18 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> within <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 36 ( Itpr118/18 ) .
To confirm the pathogenicity of this <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> we crossed heterozygous mice from the current study ( Itpr1wt/18 ) with mice heterozygous for the opt <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( Itpr1wt/opt ) .
This resulted in two litters of mice with a total of four affected Itpr1opt/18 pups ( from a total of 15 ) with a phenotype indistinguishable from that of the Itpr118/18 and Itpr1opt/opt mice [ 1 ] .
Furthermore , this phenotype was similar , although less severe , to that described in a mouse line with targeted <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of Itpr1 , where ataxia was described as a prominent feature [ 4 ] .
As with the Itpr1opt/opt mice , where the <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 43 and 44 is also predicted to leave the translational <termsem="SO:0000717"> reading frame </term> unaffected , the in - <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> Itpr118/18 <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion mutation </term> results in markedly decreased levels of Itpr1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells .
In these two spontaneous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> [ 1 ] and in the Itpr1-deficient mouse [ 4 ] generated by <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting , decreased Itpr1 expression is associated with the same autosomal recessive movement disorder ( Figure 1 ) .
Given our interest in human neurological disease we sought to identify any cognate human disorders where linkage had been established to the <termsem="SO:0005858"> <termsem="SO:0000860"> syntenic </term> region </term> of the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , but where no causal <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> had been identified .
SCA15 , an adult-onset autosomal dominant progressive ataxia is linked to this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> [ 5 ] .
Although missense <termsem="SO:0000041"> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> </term> of ITPR1 had previously been ruled out [ 2 ] and the mode of inheritance was inconsistent with that seen in the Itpr118 and Itpr1opt mice , the phenotypic presence of ataxia in the mice led us to reexamine this candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> as a possible cause of SCA15 .
We obtained <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> from three affected family members and one family member with unknown disease status from the kindred originally used to define and map SCA15 ( family AUS1 , of Australian Anglo-Celtic origin ) [ 2 ] .
We performed two experiments concurrently in three affected members of this family : <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> analysis of the <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exons </term> of ITPR1 and high-density <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> genotyping .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> analysis failed to show any <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> alterations </term> segregating with disease or any <termsem="SO:0001059"> alterations </term> that were inconsistent with Mendelian patterns of inheritance within the family .
However , visualization of log R ratio and B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency metrics from the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> genotyping experiments clearly showed data consistent with a heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> across the first one-third of ITPR1 and across the first half of a neighboring <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , SUMF1 ( Figure 2 ) .
This <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> was apparent in all three affected family members studied and absent from the family member with unknown affection status ( Figure 3 ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> data showed a <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> of between 188 kb and 210 kb in size ; examination of <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> at the flanking unknown regions of this <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> allowed us to delimit the borders of the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> to 7.5 kb on the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> side of the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> ( between rs12634249 and rs793396 ) and ~ 14.4 kb on the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> side of the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> ( between rs4073665 and rs17709863 ) .
In an attempt to define whether this <termsem="SO:0001059"> variation </term> was a benign <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> we analyzed <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> data at this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> , produced using the same genotyping chip , from 577 individuals of European descent who were either controls or individuals with an unrelated neurological disorder .
We failed to find any <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletions </term> affecting the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> of either <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , ITPR1 or SUMF1 ; we did , however , identify a single individual with a possible heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> approximately 6 kb in size within <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 40 -- 41 of ITPR1 , at least 5 kb away from <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 40 .
Given the <termsem="SO:0000001"> location </term> of this <termsem="SO:0001059"> alteration </term> it is unlikely to effect the expression or splicing of ITPR1 .
In an attempt to fine-map the breakpoints of the disease-causing <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> we performed a series of experiments designed to refine the unknown <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> at the <termsem="SO:0000699"> edges </term> between definite <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> and definite diploid <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
These data narrowed the unknown <termsem="SO:0000699"> borders </term> to ~ 4 kb on the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> side and ~ 7 kb on the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> side .
We used all possible combinations of <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward orientation </term> primers </term> <termsem="SO:0000546"> designed </term> within the newly defined <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> <termsem="SO:0000699"> boundary </term> and of <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse orientation </term> primers </term> <termsem="SO:0000546"> designed </term> within the newly defined <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> <termsem="SO:0000699"> boundary </term> in PCR assays in an attempt to amplify across the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> in affected family members .
Using PCR <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> T3F and C11R , which should be more than 200 kb apart , we were able to amplify a <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> 953 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> in size using <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> from each of the three affected family members as template .
Sequencing of this <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> revealed a <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> of 201,509 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ( Figure S3 ) , <termsem="SO:0000045"> removing </term> the first three of the nine <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> of SUMF1 and the first ten of the 58 <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> of ITPR1 .
We were unable to amplify the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> - specific <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> in the family member of unknown affection status , or in 275 neurologically normal controls .
To further establish <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> at ITPR1 as the cause of SCA15 we analyzed two additional families with an inherited cerebellar ataxia similar to that described in the AUS1 family , ascertained through neurology clinics in London , United Kingdom .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> extracted from probands from these two families ( family H33 and family H27 ) were also analyzed using Illumina Infinium HumanHap550 genotyping chips .
These experiments showed <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> at the SCA15 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> in all affected members assayed , from SUMF1 through ITPR1 .
These <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> segregated with disease in these two families ( Figure S3 ) .
A strategy similar to the one outlined above enabled us to sequence over the <termsem="SO:0001021"> breakpoint </term> in family H27 but not family H33 .
In the former , the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> spans 344,408 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> , <termsem="SO:0000045"> removing </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 1 -- 3 of SUMF1 and 1 -- 44 of ITPR1 ; in the latter , we estimate that the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> is 310 kb in length and that it <termsem="SO:0000045"> removes </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 1 -- 3 of SUMF1 and <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 1 -- 40 of ITPR1 .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> of <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> is of interest , particularly the fact that in each of the three families the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> end of the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> is anchored between <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 and 4 of SUMF1 ; <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> searches failed to identify any <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat sequences </term> </term> that might explain this phenomenon .
With three cerebellar ataxia families segregating a SUMF1 -- ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> , and this <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> not observed in a control population , we may reasonably conclude that the association is causal , and that the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> is indeed the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> basis of the disease , with SCA15 the diagnosis in the two British families as well as the original Australian family .
It is improbable that heterozygosity for the <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of SUMF1 , encoding sulfatase modifying factor 1 , of itself causes or contributes to SCA15 .
Homozygous <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of SUMF1 results in autosomal recessive multiple sulfatase deficiency , a metabolic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly , deafness , and developmental delay [ 6,7 ] .
No co-occurrence of ataxia has been described in ( heterozygous ) parents of patients with multiple sulfatase deficiency .
Conversely , <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> of ITPR1 is biologically plausible as a cause of ataxia : the protein is highly expressed in Purkinje cells ; as we have shown here , mice with <termsem="SO:0000041"> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> </term> at this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> present with ataxia ; and perturbed Ca2 + signaling has previously been implicated in the etiology of ataxia , notably in episodic ataxia type 2 and SCA6 [ 8 ] .
In further support of this conclusion , analysis of protein levels of ITPR1 in Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) immortalized lymphocytes from affected and unaffected AUS1 family members revealed that all affected members showed a dramatic decrease in ITPR1 levels when compared with the family member without the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> ( Figure 4 ) .
Itpr1 contains three <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> , an N-terminal inositol triphosphate <termsem="SO:0100018"> binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> </term> , a coupling <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , and a C-terminal transmembrane domain ; it also contains two protein kinase A phosphorylation <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> and an ATP - <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding site </term> .
Itpr1 is coupled to Ca2 + channels and facilitates Ca2 + release from the endoplasmic reticulum after binding by the intracellular second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate [ 9 ] .
Itpr1 is enriched in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum [ 4 ] .
ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> have more than one potential pathogenic mechanism .
First , the disease may be a result of haploinsufficiency at ITPR1 ; this concept is consistent with the observation that heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> leads to a later onset disorder in humans , whereas homozygous <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> in mice leads to an early onset disorder , able to be expressed within the much shorter life span of the mouse .
Second , we can not rule out the existence of an alternate <termsem="SO:0000318"> start site </term> for ITPR1 that may result in a product that confers a pathogenic gain of function to the protein ; however , Western blot analysis of cells derived from affected AUS1 family members , which was performed using an antibody raised against the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal portion </term> of ITPR1 , failed to identify any disease-specific truncated protein products .
Clearly , the identification of distinct ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> underlying SCA15 will help elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of this disorder .
We show here the utility of investigating spontaneous mouse <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in understanding human disease .
Currently , the small number of aged Itpr1wt/18 animals precludes us from examining these mice for subtle signs and symptoms similar to those seen in SCA15 patients ; however , these mice are clearly of interest to us as a potential model of SCA15 .
These data also demonstrate that <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> assay can facilitate rapid detection of structural <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> that may underlie disease .
The data provided by these approaches provide compelling evidence that heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of ITPR1 causes SCA15 .
Clearly , <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> analysis of ITPR1 in potential SCA15 cases may provide additional insight into the disease , particularly if a stop <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> were to be identified ; however , the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutational </term> mechanism noted here means that standard sequencing approaches alone are insufficient to confidently rule out ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> as a cause of disease : a comprehensive <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> dosage approach is also required .
Given that SCA16 and autosomal dominant congenital nonprogressive ataxia have both recently been mapped to <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> with the SCA15 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> [ 10,11 ] , ITPR1 is a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of importance for screening in these families .
These data add weight to a role for aberrant intracellular Ca2 + signaling in Purkinje cells in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia .
<termsem="SO:0001026"> Genome </term> - wide linkage in mice .
One hundred and twenty <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> were amplified across the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , each selected to contain one or more strain-specific <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> that would differentiate between C57BL/6J and 129x1/SvJ inbred strains [ 12 ] .
Each <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> was initially amplified in 11 affected mice and nine unaffected mice ; <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> calling was performed by dye - <termsem="SO:0000141"> terminator </term> sequencing of these <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> .
Linkage analysis using these data was performed using mlink [ 13 ] , which revealed a positive linkage at <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 6qE1 , on the 129x1/SvJ background ( two-point LOD score 5.13 at marker 20 .
MMHAP85FLG2 ) .
In an attempt to narrow the disease <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> we performed backcross experiments that resulted in the generation of three additional affected mice .
Genotyping of all affected mice across the disease-segregating <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> revealed flanking recombinants and a candidate <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of ~ 5 Mb , between markers D6Mit37 and 44 .
MMHAP85FLG5 ( Figure S1 ) .
This <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> contains 16 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> .
Identification of the underlying <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> lesion in mice .
Identification of similar phenotypes in mice linked to the 6qE1 <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> was performed by literature searches .
This revealed the Itpr1opt/opt mouse , in which disease is caused by homozygous <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion mutation </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 43 and 44 of Itpr1 .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primer </term> pairs were designed to sequence each of the <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exons </term> and at least 50 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of each flanking <termsem="SO:0000188"> intronic sequence </term> of Itpr1 .
PCR amplification of each <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> was performed using <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> from two affected mice as templates .
The Itpr118/18 <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> was confirmed by sequencing in all affected mice ( Figure S2 ) .
Breeding experiments were performed between two female mice heterozygous for the current <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( Itpr1wt/18 ) and a male mouse heterozygous for the Itpr1opt <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( Itpr1wt/opt ) .
This resulted in two litters of mice with a total of four affected Itpr1opt/18 pups ( from a total of 15 ; two of seven from first mating ; two of eight from the second mating ) with a phenotype indistinguishable from that of the Itpr118/18 and Itpr1opt/opt mice .
Analysis of Itpr1 protein in mice .
We performed Western blot analyses using standard techniques with ECL detection kits ( Amersham , http://www.amersham.com ) .
Briefly , dissected whole brains from postnatal day 21 littermates were homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X-100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % SDS , and a cocktail of protease inhibitors ( Roche , http://www.roche.com ) .
Homogenates were diluted appropriately , mixed with 4  reducing sample buffer , and loaded onto 4 % -- 12 % precast gradient gels ( Novex , http://www.invitrogen.com ) for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting .
The antibodies to Itpr1 ( 1:2,000 ) and Actb ( 1:5,000 ) were used as recommended by manufacturers .
Immunohistochemistry .
Brains were isolated from 21-d-old mice , perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , and post-fixed overnight in the same fixative .
Brains were embedded in gelatin , and 35-m sagittal sections were cut using a sliding microtome ( NeuroScience Associates , http://www.neuroscienceassociates.com ) .
Sections from <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> , heterozygote , and homozygous brains were placed in the MultiBrain template .
Sections were washed in 1  PBS prior to 1 h of incubation in block solution containing 1  PBS with 20 % normal goat serum and 0.3 % Triton X-100 ( pH 7.4 ) .
Sections were incubated overnight at 4 C in primary antibodies : affinity purified polyclonal Itpr1 antibody ( 1:2,000 , Chemicon International , http://www.chemicon.com ) and monoclonal anti-Calb1 antibody ( 1:6,000 , Sigma-Aldrich , http://www.sigmaaldrich.com ) diluted in carrier solution .
Following extensive washes ( in 6.0 ml of PBS , three times ) , sections were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG [ Invitrogen , http://www.invitrogen.com ] ) for 1 h at room temperature .
Sections were washed and mounted on glass slides in a buffered medium containing Mowiol ( Calbiochem , http://www.emdbiosciences.com ) as described earlier [ 14 ] .
Sections were imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope ( LSM 510 ; Zeiss , http://www.zeiss.com ) .
Imaging parameters ( pinhole , detector gain , laser power ) were optimized , and were kept constant for the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> , heterozygous , and homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> brains .
Specificity of the Itpr1 antibodies was verified by preabsorption control experiments .
Antibody dilutions were incubated for 24 h at 4 C with the immunizing <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> .
Tissue sections were incubated with the preabsorbed antibodies and processed as described above .
Under these conditions , no staining above autofluorescence was detected .
Analysis of ITPR1 in SCA15 patients .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> was extracted from EBV immortalized lymphocytes , derived from family members .
The <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exons </term> and at least 50 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of flanking <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> of ITPR1 were PCR amplified and sequenced using dye - <termsem="SO:0000141"> terminator </term> sequencing ( BigDye version 3.1 ; Applied Biosystems , http://www.appliedbiosystems.com ) .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> reactions were run on an ABI3730XP automated sequencer as per the manufacturer 's instructions ( Applied Biosystems ) .
This analysis was performed in all three affected family members for whom <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> was available ( members 6 , 7 , and 19 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primer sequences </term> and conditions are available upon request .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> data were analyzed using Sequencher ( <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> Codes Corporation , http://www.genecodes.com ) .
<termsem="SO:0001026"> Genome </term> - wide <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> genotyping was performed using Infinium HumanHap550 <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> genotyping chips as per the manufacturer 's protocol ( Illumina , http://www.illumina.com ) .
This product assays 555,352 unique <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> .
Data were collected using the Illumina BeadStation scanner and data collection software .
<termsem="SO:0001027"> Genotypes </term> were produced using the genotyping module of BeadStudio ( version 2.3.25 ; Illumina ) , and log R ratio and B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency were visualized using the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> viewer tool within this package .
In order to rule out the possibility that the observed <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> within ITPR1 was a benign copy number variant we examined log R ratio and B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency metrics of HumanHap550 genotyping data at this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> from 577 individuals of Northern European descent from North America and Europe , produced by us as a part of an ongoing study .
In an attempt to narrow the unknown <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> flanking the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> observed in family AUS1 , we designed <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> for 30 PCR amplifications that would generate <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> across the two <termsem="SO:0000239"> bordering regions </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer sequence </term> and conditions available upon request ) .
There were ten <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pairs in the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> <termsem="SO:0000239"> flanking region </term> and 20 pairs in the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> <termsem="SO:0000239"> flanking region </term> ( Figure S3 ) .
On average each product was ~ 750 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> in size , and amplifications were performed using <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> from each of the three affected individuals ( family members 6 , 7 , and 19 ) .
Dye - <termsem="SO:0000141"> terminator </term> sequencing of each product was performed using the <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> and <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primers </term> <termsem="SO:0000546"> designed </term> for amplification ; running and analysis of each <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> was performed as described above .
Amplification of a <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from a normal diploid <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> was denoted by the presence of a heterozygous <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> ; amplification of a <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from a <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> harboring a heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> was inferred when homozygosity for the major <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and the minor <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were noted among the three affected family members ( i.e. , this is inconsistent with Mendelian inheritance in related individuals known to share a common <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> ) .
Using the data from the experiments described above we were able to limit the size of unknown <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> flanking the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> to ~ 4 kb on the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> side and 7 kb on the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> side .
All combinations of <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primers </term> from the newly defined <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> flanking the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> on the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> side with <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primers </term> from the newly defined <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> flanking the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> on the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> side were used in PCR amplification reactions performed with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> from the three affected family members and single unaffected family members .
This experiment was performed in an attempt to amplify across the <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> and define the exact <termsem="SO:0001021"> breakpoint </term> .
A single <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> was obtained from the third <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primer </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric </term> side ( T3f 5  - TGAATGCTCAATTTTCCAGC-3  ) with the 11th <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primer </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromeric </term> side ( C11r 5  - GGGAAAATGGATAGAGGGTG-3  ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> , which is 953 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> in size , was sequenced as described above and compared to the current <termsem="SO:0001248"> build </term> of the human <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
A similar series of experiments was performed to identify the <termsem="SO:0001415"> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> breakpoints </term> in families H27 and H33 ; we were able to amplify a 369 - <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> across the <termsem="SO:0001021"> breakpoint </term> found in affected members of family H27 using <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair H27-11F 5  - GACCTCAAGAAGGCATGAATAC-3  and H27-3R 5  - ATGGTGGCCAGGTACACAAG-3  ( Figure S4 ) , but to date we have been unable to identify the <termsem="SO:0001021"> breakpoint </term> in family H33 .
Western blot analysis in SCA15 patients .
EBV immortalized lymphoblasts from three affected family members who carry the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> and one family member without the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> were used as a readily accessible source of protein ; all samples came from members of family AUS1 .
Protein extraction was performed using lysis buffer containing 1  TBS , 1 % Triton X-100 , and a cocktail of protease inhibitors ( Roche ) with overnight lysis at  80 C .
Homogenates were diluted appropriately , mixed with 4  reducing sample buffer , and loaded onto 4 % -- 12 % precast gradient gels ( NuPAGE , Invitrogen ) for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting .
The antibodies to ITPR1 ( 1:1,000 ) and ACTB ( 1:5,000 ) were used as recommended by manufacturers .

Upper panel shows log R ratio and B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency metrics generated from Infinium HumanHap550 arrays for an affected family member from each family .
Log R ratio is the ratio of normalized , observed R to expected R for each <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> ( each <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> is a blue dot ) and thus serves as a surrogate of copy number at each <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency is a measure of the number of times the A or B <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are detected at each <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> ( each <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> is denoted by a blue dot ) .
Thus , <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> with a B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency of one are apparent B/B homozygotes , <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> with a B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency of 0.5 are apparent A/B heterozygotes , and those with a B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency of zero are apparent A/A homozygotes .
These plots show a contiguous <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ~ 310 kb long ( family H33 ) and ~ 350 kb long ( family H27 ) with decreased copy number and apparent homozygosity indicative of a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> ( shaded grey ) .

Immunohistochemistry and Western Blot Analysis of ITPR1 Protein Levels in Mouse Cerebellum .
( A -- F ) Immunohistochemistry of cerebellum from a <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mouse ( A and D ) , a mouse heterozygous for the Itpr1 18 - <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> ( B and E ) , and a mouse homozygous for the 18 - <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> Itpr1 <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> ( C and F ) .
( A -- C ) Immunohistochemistry using polyclonal Itpr1 anti-rabbit antibody ( 1:2,000 ; Alexa Fluor 555 ) ; ( D -- F ) immunohistochemistry using monoclonal Calb1 anti-mouse antibody ( 1:6,000 ; Alexa Fluor 488 ) .
Scale bars denote 100 m .
As previously described , Iptr1 is highly expressed in the Purkinje cells .
Notably , there appears to be decreased immunoreactivity to Itpr1 in the heterozygous and homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
( G ) Western blot performed to examine Itpr1 levels in whole brain from <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> , Itpr1wt/18 , and Itpr118/18 mice ; this clearly shows a reduction of Itpr1 in brain tissue from Itpr1wt/18 mice and a greater reduction of Itpr1 in Itpr118/18 mice .
Metrics Derived from Analysis of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> from Affected Family Member 7 Using Illumina Infinium HumanHap550 Genotyping Chips .
The upper and lower plots are log R ratio and B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency , respectively , at an ~ 800-kb <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> on the p <termsem="SO:0000105"> arm of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 3 .
Log R ratio is the ratio of normalized , observed R to expected R for each <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> ( each <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> is a blue dot ) and thus serves as a surrogate of copy number at each <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency is a measure of the number of times the A or B <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are detected at each <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> ( each <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNP </term> is denoted by a blue dot ) .
Thus , <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> with a B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency of one are apparent B/B homozygotes , <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> with a B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency of 0.5 are apparent A/B heterozygotes , and those with a B <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> frequency of zero are apparent A/A homozygotes .
Clearly , these plots show a contiguous <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ~ 200 kb long with decreased copy number and apparent homozygosity ( bounded by a red box ) .
As we have demonstrated previously , this is indicative of a heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> [ 15 ] .

Western Blot Analysis of ITPR1 Protein Levels in EBV Immortalized Lymphoblasts from AUS1 Family Members .
Western blot performed to examine ITPR1 levels in EBV immortalized lymphocytes from AUS1 affected family members carrying the ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> and from an AUS1 family member of unknown disease status who does not carry the <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> .
Notably the samples from patients with ITPR1 <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> show a dramatic decrease in ITPR1 levels .
To demonstrate equal loading , these samples were diluted one in five , and the Western blot was repeated using an antibody against ACTB .
