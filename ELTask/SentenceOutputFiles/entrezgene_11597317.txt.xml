<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> and homologous recombination .
Two recent papers provide new evidence relevant to the role of the breast cancer susceptibility gene <termsem="EG:12190"> BRCA2 </term> in DNA repair .
Moynahan et al provide genetic data indicating a requirement for <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> in homology-dependent ( recombinational ) repair of DNA double-strand breaks .
The second paper , by Davies et al , begins to address the mechanism through which <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> makes its contribution to recombinational repair .
BRCA2 appears to function in recombination via interactions with the major eukaryotic recombinase RAD51 [ 1,2,3 ] .
We briefly review the context in which the two studies were carried out , we comment on the results presented , and we discuss models designed to account for the role of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> in <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- mediated repair .
Keywords : breast cancer , homologous recombination .
<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> was the second breast cancer susceptibility gene to be discovered , and was isolated through positional cloning using data from families with inherited breast cancer [ 4 ] .
Cells with mutant BRCA2 protein are , like many cancer cells , genetically unstable and accumulate gross chromosomal rearrangements [ 5,6 ] .
The sequence of this large protein ( 3418 amino acids ) offers very little clue to its function , although there are eight repeated segments ( termed BRC repeats ) in the middle of the protein that are highly conserved among mammalian orthologs [ 7,8 ] .
Breast cancer susceptibility genes and DNA repair .
Following the landmark discovery by Scully et al that the homologous recombinase RAD51 colocalizes at subnuclear sites with BRCA1 [ 9 ] , a number of additional results have provided evidence that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in recombinational repair of DNA damage .
BRCA1 and BRCA2 form discrete nuclear foci during the S phase and after exposure to DNA damaging agents [ 9,10,11 ] .
These foci are probably sites of repair of spontaneous and induced DNA damage [ 12,13,14 ] .
Cell lines defective in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 are sensitive to damaging agents that form double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) , as are other cell lines defective in recombinational repair ( reviewed in [ 15 ] ) .
BRCA2 interacts with the RAD51 recombinase via direct protein-protein contacts [ 16,17,18,19 ] .
Biochemical analysis also showed interaction between BRCA1 and RAD51 , although these detected interactions may have been indirect [ 9 ] .
The BRC repeats of BRCA2 are responsible for direct RAD51 interaction .
Cells lacking BRCA1/2 fail to form damage-induced subnuclear RAD51 foci with normal efficiency , suggesting that these proteins are required for the formation of recombinase complexes at the sites of DNA damage [ 20,21 ] .
Finally , genetic measurements of recombination frequency have shown that Brca1 - / - embryonic stem ( ES ) cells are deficient in recombinational DSB repair [ 22,23 ] .
The similarity between phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency , together with data showing a similar effect of DNA damage on distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in repair-proficient cells , led to the hypothesis that BRCA2 , like BRCA1 , is required for efficient recombinational repair .
The paper by Moynahan et al [ 24 ] provides important support for this hypothesis .
Measuring DSB-induced recombination frequency in <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> - defective cells .
Pierce et al have designed a set of recombination substrates for measuring the level of homologous recombination in vivo ( Fig. 1 ) [ 25 ] .
The DNA substrate contains a pair of mutated GFP genes ( GFP encodes the easily detected green fluorescent protein ) , one of which contains a restriction site for <termsem="EG:854590"> I-SceI </term> , a yeast intron encoded endonuclease with an 18 base pair recognition site .
Transient transfection of an <termsem="EG:854590"> I-SceI </term> expression vector results in the production of a DSB in the first mutated copy of GFP .
One or both DNA ends formed by the break invade ( s ) the homologous sequence in the second mutant GFP copy , resulting in repair of the DSB via a homology-mediated gene conversion event .
The configuration of the GFP construct is such that homology-mediated repair often results in the formation of a functional copy of GFP .
Such events can be detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis by virtue of their expression of GFP .
Moynahan et al [ 24 ] have used such a GFP recombination substrate to demonstrate that cells with defective <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> protein are deficient in their ability to repair the <termsem="EG:854590"> I-SceI </term> - induced DSB through homologous recombination .
Expression of <termsem="EG:854590"> I-SceI </term> resulted in 1 out of 1400 cells producing GFP via homologous recombination in the human pancreatic tumor cell line CAPAN-1 .
CAPAN-1 cells carry a deletion of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> on one homolog and codes for a protein truncated at amino acid 1981 on the other homolog .
The authors indicate that the level of <termsem="EG:854590"> I-SceI </term> - induced recombination in CAPAN-1 is over 100-fold less than that seen using other ( <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> + ) human tumor cell lines .
The different lines examined , however , are very likely to differ genetically from CAPAN-1 cells not only at the <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> locus , but also at a very large number of additional loci .
This raises the possibility that some or even all of the recombinational repair defect seen in CAPAN-1 could be due to mutations at non - <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> loci .
While Moynahan et al were careful to point out this problem , two sets of results argue against the possibility that the recombinational repair deficiency of CAPAN-1 cells is completely independent of its defect in <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> .
First , in the same study [ 24 ] , recombination in a mouse ES cell line that expresses only truncated <termsem="EG:12190"> BRCA2 </term> protein was measured .
This line was found to have lower recombination efficiency than isogenic cells expressing full-length <termsem="EG:12190"> BRCA2 </term> ( the defect observed was about fivefold to sixfold ) .
Second , in an independent study , Powell was able to compare derivatives of CAPAN-1 that differed only in their ability to express full-length <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> protein ( S. Powell , personal communication , 2001 ) .
In these experiments , the derivative expressing full-length <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> yielded 10-fold more recombinants than controls expressing only truncated <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> ( S. Powell , personal communication , 2001 ) .
While the experimental design of these experiments was somewhat different from that of Moyna-han et al [ 24 ] , the results raise the possibility that CAPAN-1 cells have more than one mutation that lowers the efficiency of recombinational repair relative to that observed in other human cell lines .
Conversely , the <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> defect in CAPAN-1 could be fully responsible for the 100-fold defect in recombination if the level of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> complementation observed by Powell was incomplete .
Furthermore , the discrepancy between the 100-fold difference between CAPAN-1 and the other human lines as compared with the fivefold to sixfold difference between the Brca2lex1/lex2cells and <termsem="EG:12190"> Brca2 </term> + / + ES cells might simply be accounted for by the fact that Brca2lex1/lex2 is not a null allele .
Additional studies are likely to shed light on the efficiency of <termsem="EG:12190"> BRCA2 </term> - independent recombination pathways .
Taken together , the results indicate that <termsem="EG:12190"> BRCA2 </term> is indeed required for high levels of recombinational repair in both human and mouse .
The function of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> - <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> interaction .
The second paper providing evidence , by Davies et al [ 26 ] , is a biochemical study of the interaction between the homologous recombinase <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> and a peptide consisting of one of the eight BRC repeats from <termsem="EG:675"> human BRCA2 </term> .
Expression of a single BRC repeat ( BRC4 ) had previously been reported to act as an inhibitor of DNA repair by Chen et al [ 27 ] .
These investigators showed that expression of constructs containing the BRC4 repeat in MCF-7 cells enhances the radiosensitivity of cells and blocks both the G2/M delay associated with damage and the ability of the transfected cells to assembly subnuclear <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> foci .
In the paper by Davies et al , data provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of the dominant negative effect associated with expression of a single BRC repeat .
DNA binding assays and electron microscopy methods were used to show that a BRC3 peptide interferes with the ability of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> to assemble into oligomeric filaments on DNA .
A BRC4 peptide was also reported to inhibit the <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- DNA interaction .
These experiments raise the possibility that the full-length <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> protein could act as a negative regulator of inappropriate <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- DNA interaction .
The final experiment reported by Davies et al [ 26 ] is particularly important with respect to understanding the mechanism ( s ) through which <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> promotes <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> - dependent recombination .
The localization of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> was examined in CAPAN-1 cells , the same human tumor line examined by Moynahan et al [ 24 ] .
It had been shown previously that the small amount of truncated <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> protein expressed by CAPAN-1 cells was mislocalized to the cytoplasm , consistent with the fact that the truncation protein lacks a nuclear localization signal [ 28 ] .
Davies et al showed CAPAN-1 cells to be defective in nuclear localization of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> , raising the possibility that <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> is normally carried to the nucleus by binding <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> .
It is possible that <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> may alternatively be capable of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> - independent transport , but mislocalization of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> to the cytoplasm may sequester <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> and block its normal mode of transport .
Support for the hypothesis that the observed mislocalization of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> is an indirect consequence of the <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> defect requires reintroduction of functional <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> into CAPAN-1 .
Given the elaborate nature of the <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> interaction , it seems somewhat unlikely that the only role of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> in promoting recombination is to serve as a specific nuclear transporter of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> .
An attractive alternative , favored by Davies et al [ 26 ] , is that the association of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> is required to maintain <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> in a form that is in a state of ` readiness ' ( Fig. 2a ) .
In the absence of this interaction with <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> , <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> might exist in a form that is not capable of being recruited into a functional repair complex when damage occurs .
For example , previous studies indicated that <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> shows little binding preference for single-strand DNA ( ssDNA ) over double-strand DNA ( dsDNA ) [ 3,29 ] .
This result could mean that regulatory factors , such as <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> , are required to suppress <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- dsDNA interactions to prevent sequestration of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> in a nonfunctional form .
Alternatively , or in addition , suppression of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- ssDNA interaction might be important for preventing <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> from binding to the regions of ssDNA that form during normal DNA replication .
<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> may thus promote <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> assembly into recombinational repair complexes via a negative regulatory mechanism ( i.e. by blocking <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> interaction until damage has occurred and factors required for ` productive ' assembly of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> at damaged sites are in place ) .
As mentioned previously , the ability of a BRC peptide to repress the <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> interaction could reflect a role of full-length protein in suppressing unwanted <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> interactions .
Yet another potential role for <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> in promoting <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> - dependent recombinational repair is a positive role in assembly of <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> at damaged sites ( Fig. 2b ) .
Several proteins that interact with RAD51 are thought to ` mediate ' assembly of RAD51 at sites of DNA damage ( reviewed in [ 30 ] ) .
RAD51 paralogs in particular , including XRCC2 , XRCC3 , RAD51B , RAD51C and RAD51D , may function as a complex that actively promotes RAD51 assembly [ 31 ] .
<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> could cooperate with <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> paralogs in promoting <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> assembly , or even provide an alternative assembly pathway .
The observation that BRCA2 localizes to damage-induced subnuclear foci with RAD51 seems consistent with the possibility that <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> plays a positive role in assembly of the recombination complex [ 11 ] .
Finally , it is important to note that the two models for the function of the <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> -- <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> interaction shown in Figure 2 are not mutually exclusive .
<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> could prevent inappropriate <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> assembly in the absence of damage and promote functional <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> assembly at DNA lesions during the damage response .
Further experiments are clearly required to clarify the functional interactions between <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> and <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> during recombinational repair .
It should be relatively straightforward to determine whether the role of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> is limited to transporting <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> to the nucleus .
If this were the case , addition of a nuclear localization signal to <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> should suppress the <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> - mediated phenotypes associated with a <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> mutation .
However , biochemical experiments are needed to determine whether full-length <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> blocks or promotes <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> interaction .
Such experiments could also reveal additional roles for <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> in recombinational repair .
However , several technical obstacles , including the large size of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> , promise to make biochemical characterization of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> function difficult .
DSB = double-strand break ; dsDNA = double-strand DNA ; ES = embryonic stem ; GFP = green fluorescent protein ; ssDNA = single-strand DNA .
Recombination substrates used for assaying homology-directed repair .
Cutting at the <termsem="EG:854590"> I-SceI </term> site within the mutant GFP ( SceGFP ) results in a double-strand break that can be repaired through homologous gene conversion using a 3 ' - truncated copy of GFP as sequence donor .
The mechanism results in the formation of a functional copy of the GFP gene .
The model shown assumes gene conversion occurs via the synthesis-dependent annealing mechanism .
Potential roles of <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> in promoting assembly of <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> at sites of DNA damage .
Chromosomal DNA is shown as pairs of straight lines , <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> as open circles , and <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> as grey bars .
( a ) Prevention of nonproductive DNA interactions .
<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> -- <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> interaction is proposed to suppress <termsem="EG:5888"> RAD51 </term> -- <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> interactions until DNA damage is present .
When damage occurs , <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> is recruited to damaged sites where is polymerizes into nucleoprotein filaments .
In this model , <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> is not required for assembly of functional complexes at damaged sites , only to prevent a substantial fraction of <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> from being sequestered in a nonfunctional form .
In a <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> - defective cell , mutant <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> becomes associated with DNA at random sites and is therefore not readily recruited to sites of damage .
( b ) Positive regulation .
<termsem="EG:675"> BRCA2 </term> is proposed to be required for <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> to assemble into functional recombinational repair complexes at sites of damage .
In <termsem="EG:675"> BRCA </term> - defective cells , <termsem="EG:5888"> Rad51 </term> fails to associate with sites of damage due to lack of an assembly factor .
