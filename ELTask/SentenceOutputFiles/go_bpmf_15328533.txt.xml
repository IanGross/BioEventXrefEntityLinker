<termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulation </term> of Muscle Fiber Type and Running Endurance by PPAR .
Endurance exercise training can <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> an <termsem="GO:0043500"> adaptive muscle fiber transformation </term> and an increase of mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> by triggering scripted changes in <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> .
However , no <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> has yet been identified that can <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> this process .
We describe the <termsem="GO:0000003"> engineering </term> of a mouse capable of continuous running of up to twice the distance of a wild-type littermate .
This was achieved by targeted <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of an activated form of peroxisome proliferator-activated <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term>  ( PPAR ) in skeletal muscle , which <termsem="GO:0031128"> induces </term> a switch to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> increased numbers of type I muscle fibers .
Treatment of wild-type mice with PPAR <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonist </term> </term> elicits a similar type I fiber <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> profile in muscle .
Moreover , these genetically <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> fibers confer resistance to obesity with improved <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic </term> profiles , even in the absence of exercise .
These results demonstrate that complex physiologic properties such as fatigue , endurance , and running capacity can be molecularly analyzed and manipulated .
Skeletal muscle fibers are generally classified as type I ( oxidative/slow ) or type II ( <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolytic </term> / fast ) fibers .
They display marked differences in respect to <termsem="GO:0006936"> contraction </term> , <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolism </term> , and susceptibility to fatigue .
Type I fibers are mitochondria-rich and mainly use <termsem="GO:0045333"> oxidative metabolism </term> for energy production , which provides a stable and long-lasting supply of ATP , and thus are fatigue-resistant .
Type II fibers comprise three subtypes , IIa , IIx , and IIb .
Type IIb fibers have the lowest levels of mitochondrial content and oxidative enzymes , rely on <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolytic metabolism </term> as a major energy source , and are susceptible to fatigue , while the oxidative and <termsem="GO:0006936"> contraction functions </term> of type IIa and IIx lie between type I and IIb ( Booth and Thomason 1991 ; Berchtold et al. 2000 ; Olson and Williams 2000 ) .
Adult skeletal muscle shows plasticity and can undergo conversion between different fiber types in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to exercise training or <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulation </term> of motoneuron activity ( Booth and Thomason 1991 , Jarvis et al. 1996 ; Pette 1998 ; Olson and Williams 2000 ; Hood 2001 ) .
This conversion of muscle fiber from type IIb to type IIa and type I is likely to be mediated by a <termsem="GO:0019722"> calcium signaling pathway </term> that involves calcineurin , <termsem="GO:0004683"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> calmodulin-dependent kinase </term> </term> , and the <termsem="GO:0003712"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> cofactor </term> </term> Peroxisome proliferator-activated <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> - gamma <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivator </term> </term> 1 ( PGC-1 ) ( Naya et al. 2000 ; Olson and Williams 2000 ; Lin et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) .
However , the targeted <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> factors </term> </term> directly responsible for reprogramming the fiber-specific <termsem="GO:0006936"> contractile </term> and <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic </term> genes remain to be identified .
Muscle fiber <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> appears to be associated with obesity and diabetes .
For instance , rodents that gain the most weight on high-fat diets possess fewer type I fibers ( Abou et al. 1992 ) .
In obese patients , skeletal muscle has been observed to have reduced oxidative capacity , increased <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolytic </term> capacity , and a decreased percentage of type I fibers ( Hickey et al. 1995 ; Tanner et al. 2002 ) .
Similar observations have been made in type 2 diabetic patients ( Lillioja et al. 1987 ; Hickey et al. 1995 ) .
Recently , it has been shown that increasing oxidative fibers can lead to improved insulin action and reduced adipocyte size ( Luquet et al. 2003 ; Ryder et al. 2003 ) .
We have previously established that peroxisome proliferator-activated <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> ( PPAR )  is a major <termsem="GO:0030528"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulator </term> </term> of fat burning in adipose tissue through activation of enzymes associated with long-chain <termsem="GO:0006635"> fatty-acid -oxidation </term> ( Wang et al. 2003 ) .
Although PPAR is the predominant PPAR isoform present in skeletal muscle , its in vivo function has not been determined .
Our current study uncovers PPAR as the first <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> able to <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> the formation of functional type I muscle fibers , whose activation entrains complex pathways both <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhancing </term> physical performance and creating a state of obesity resistance .
Activation of PPAR Leads to Muscle Fiber Transformation .
A role of PPAR in muscle fiber was suggested by its <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> -- at levels 10-fold and 50-fold greater than PPAR and  isoforms , respectively ( unpublished data ) .
An examination of PPAR in different muscle fibers reveals a significantly higher level in type I muscle ( soleus ) relative to type II -- rich muscle ( extensor digitorum longus ) or type I and type II mixed muscle ( gastrocnemius ) ( Figure 1A ) ; this <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern closely resembles that of PGC-1 ( Lin et al. 2002 ) .
A similar pattern but with more pronounced differences was found at the protein level ( Figure 1B ) .
To directly assess the role of activation of PPAR in <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of muscle fiber plasticity and mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> a transgene in which the 78-amino-acid VP16 activation domain was fused to the N-terminus of full-length PPAR , under <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the 2.2-kb human -skeletal actin promoter .
In agreement with the previous characterization of this promoter ( Brennan and Hardeman 1993 ; Clapham et al. 2000 ) , the VP16-PPAR transgene was selectively <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in skeletal muscle , with 10-fold less in the heart ( Figure 1C ) .
Among different types of muscle fibers , the levels of VP16-PPAR <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appeared to be similar ( unpublished data ) .
As shown in Figure 1D for gastrocnemius muscle , VP16-PPAR fusion protein was <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> at a level similar to that of endogenous PPAR in wild-type littermates .
Interestingly , the level of endogenous muscle PPAR protein in the transgenic mice was much higher than in the control littermates .
The substantial increase of endogenous PPAR may have been caused by a switch to type I fiber ( see below ) , which intrinsically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expresses </term> higher levels of PPAR ( Figure 1A and 1B ) .
Type I muscle can be readily distinguished from type II or mixed muscle by its red color , because of its high concentration of myoglobin , a protein typically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in oxidative muscle fibers .
We found that muscles in the transgenic mice appeared redder ( Figure 2A ) , which is particularly evident in the mixed type I/II fibers of the hindlimb ( Figure 2B ) .
Indeed , metachromatic staining revealed a substantial muscle fiber transformation ( Figure 2C ) .
In gastrocnemius muscle , we estimated that there was a 2-fold increase of type I fibers .
A diagnostic component of oxidative fibers is their high myoglobin and mitochondrial content , which is supported by the mRNA analysis shown in Figure 3A .
In addition to myoglobin , mitochondrial components for <termsem="GO:0006118"> electron transfer </term> ( cytochrome c and <termsem="GO:0004129"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytochrome c oxidase </term> </term> [ <termsem="GO:0004129"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> COX </term> </term> ] II and IV ) and <termsem="GO:0006635"> fatty-acid -oxidation </term> enzymes were elevated ( Figure 3A ; unpublished data ) .
These effects appear to be direct consequences of PPAR activation , as levels of PGC-1 , a <termsem="GO:0003713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> coactivator </term> </term> involved in muscle fiber switch and mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> ( Wu et al. 1999 ; Lehman et al. 2000 ; Lin et al. 2002 ) , remained unchanged .
Southern blot analysis detected a substantially higher copy number of the mitochondrial genome -- encoded COXII DNA in the transgenic mice ( Figure 3B ) .
Mitochondrial DNA was increased 2.3-fold in gastrocnemius muscle of the transgenic mice ( Figure 3C ) .
These results reveal a marked stimulation of mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> and further support the idea that there is a muscle fiber switch .
This conclusion was also confirmed by Western blot analysis .
As shown in Figure 3D , the characteristic type I fiber proteins , such as myoglobin and cytochrome c and b , were significantly increased .
More importantly , the specialized <termsem="GO:0006936"> contraction </term> protein troponin I ( slow ) of type I fiber was robustly induced ; this was accompanied by a marked reduction of the specialized <termsem="GO:0006936"> contraction </term> protein troponin I ( fast ) of type II fiber , indicating a high degree of fiber transformation .
We next examined whether acute activation of endogenous PPAR would induce similar target genes .
In agreement with the chronic effects in the transgenic mice , we found that , after treatment of wild-type C57B6J mice with the PPAR-specific <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonist </term> </term> GW501516 for only 10 d , genes for slow fiber <termsem="GO:0006936"> contractile </term> proteins , mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> , and <termsem="GO:0006635"> -oxidation </term> were all <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> ( Figure 3E ) .
This indicates that rapid , systematic , and coordinated changes of muscle fiber properties toward type I can be achieved by activation of the endogenous PPAR pathway .
Muscle Fiber Switch by PPAR Protects Against Obesity .
A number of previous studies have shown that obese individuals have fewer oxidative fibers , implying that the presence of oxidative fibers alone may play a part in obesity resistance .
To test this possibility , we <termsem="GO:0007631"> fed </term> the transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates with a high-fat diet for 97 d. Although the initial body weights of the two groups were very similar , the transgenic mice had gained less than 50 % at day 47 , and only one-third at day 97 , of the weight gained by the wild-type animals ( Figure 4A ) .
The transgenic mice displayed significantly higher oxygen consumption on the high-fat diet than the control littermates ( unpublished data ) .
By the end of this experiment , the control littermates became obese , whereas the transgenic mice still maintained a normal body weight and fat mass composition ( Figure 4A ) .
A histological analysis of inguinal fat pad revealed a much smaller cell size in the transgenic mice ( Figure 4B ) , due to the increased muscle oxidative capacity .
While there was no significant difference in intramuscular glycogen content , the triglyceride content was much less in the transgenic mice ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , which may explain their improved glucose tolerance ( Figure 4E ) .
We also placed wild-type C57BJ6 mice on the high-fat diet and treated them with either vehicle or the PPAR <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonist </term> </term> GW501516 for 2 mo. .
GW501516 produced a sustained induction of genes for type I muscle fibers ; this , at least in part , resulted in an only 30 % gain in body weight , a dramatically reduced fat mass accumulation , and improved glucose tolerance , compared to the vehicle-treated group ( Figure 5 ) .
Thus , muscle fiber conversion by stimulation with the PPAR <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonist </term> </term> or the activated transgene has a protective role against obesity .
Activation of PPAR <termsem="GO:0048518"> Enhances </term> Physical Performance .
Muscle oxidative capacity is a crucial factor for determining endurance and fatigue .
Indeed , type I fibers <termsem="GO:0043500"> adaptively </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> through exercise training are considered to be fatigue resistant .
However , whether the type I fibers <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> molecularly via PPAR <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> can contribute to <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> performance in the absence of previous training is unclear .
In fact , the consequence of genetically <termsem="GO:0031128"> induced </term> fiber switch on running capacity has to our knowledge never been evaluated .
We thus compared exercise performance between untrained , body-weight-matched transgenic and wild-type littermates .
Mice were run on oxygen-infused , enclosed treadmills until exhaustion .
Strikingly , the running time and distance the transgenic mice were able to sustain were increased by 67 % and 92 % , respectively ( Figure 6A ; also see Videos S1 and S2 ) .
The transgenic mice ran about 1 h longer than the controls , which translates to nearly a kilometer further .
No significant differences in muscle mass ( unpublished data ) and daily activity ( total counts of activity per hour : 1618  209 for transgenic versus 1987  301 for wild-type , p > 0.35 , n = 4 ) were observed between the transgenic and control mice .
Thus , the remarkable increase in endurance is the physiologic manifestation of muscle fiber transformation .
This suggests that genetically <termsem="GO:0065007"> directed </term> muscle fiber switch is physiologically and functionally relevant .
In addition , we looked at what effect the absence of PPAR function has on exercise endurance .
In the treadmill test , the PPAR-null mice could sustain only 38 % of the running time and 34 % of the distance of their age - and weight-matched wild-type counterparts ( Figure 6B ) .
These results further support a role for PPAR in <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhancement </term> of physical performance .
Our data reveal that a PPAR-mediated <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional pathway </term> can <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> muscle fiber <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> , enabling the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of a strain of mice with a `` long-distance running '' phenotype .
We show that targeted <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of an activated form of PPAR produces profound and coordinated increases in oxidation enzymes , mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> , and production of specialized type I fiber <termsem="GO:0006936"> contractile </term> proteins -- the three hallmarks for muscle fiber type switching ( Figure 6C ) .
While induction of muscle oxidation enzymes by PPAR has been seen both in vivo and in vitro ( Muoio et al. 2002 ; Dressel et al. 2003 ; Luquet et al. 2003 ; Tanaka et al. 2003 ; Wang et al. 2003 ) , its effects shown here on muscle fiber switching are unexpected .
These progressive changes in oxidative capacity in conjunction with eventual changes in type I muscle fiber lead to a dramatically improved exercise profile and protection against obesity .
This does not solely depend on achieving a <termsem="GO:0065007"> directed </term> muscle fiber type switch but also requires all the associated changes in neural innervation , <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron function , and peripheral <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic </term> <termsem="GO:0051866"> adaptation </term> to enable a new integrated <termsem="GO:0050896"> physiological response </term> .
Accordingly , activation of muscle PPAR essentially recapitulates the effects of exercise training even in the absence of training itself .
To our knowledge , this has not been directly described for any other <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> factor </term> </term> .
The muscle phenotypes described here are remarkably similar to those of transgenic mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> either calcineurin , <termsem="GO:0004683"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> calmodulin-dependent kinase </term> </term> , or PGC-1 ( Naya et al. 2000 ; Lin et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) , indicating that PPAR could be one of the hypothetical downstream <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> of these pathways .
It is important to note that , from our ligand and gain-of-function transgenic studies , PPAR needs to be activated in order to <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> the muscle fiber switch .
Indeed , in a recent report by Luquet et al. ( 2003 ) , simple overexpression of wild-type PPAR in muscle was found not to be sufficient to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> a fiber switch or obesity resistance , although certain oxidation enzymes were increased .
This supports the model in Figure 6C that the activating signal or ligand , but not the <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , is limiting .
Thus , PPAR activation , rather than merely an increase of PPAR levels , is an essential element for fiber switching and its associated functional manifestations .
How might endogenous PPAR become activated naturally by exercise training ?
First , it is possible that exercise <termsem="GO:0009058"> generates </term> or increases endogenous ligands for PPAR as tissues are undergoing substantial increases in fatty-acid internalization and burning .
Fatty acids and their metabolites can activate PPAR .
A second model is that exercise may induce <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of PGC-1 ( Goto et al. 2000 ) and thereby activate PPAR .
This is consistent with previous work in which we have shown that PGC-1 physically associates with PPAR in muscle tissue and can powerfully activate it even in the absence of ligands ( Wang et al. 2003 ) .
Alternatively , PPAR may be activated by a distal upstream <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> component such as a <termsem="GO:0007243"> <termsem="GO:0016301"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> kinase </term> </term> cascade </term> .
Further dissecting the interactions between PPAR and its <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> components will be necessary to fully understand the molecular basis of muscle fiber determination pertinent to exercise training .
Skeletal muscle is a major site to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> whole-body fatty-acid and <termsem="GO:0006006"> glucose metabolism </term> .
We show that mice with increased oxidative fibers are resistant to high-fat-induced obesity and glucose intolerance .
Moreover , ligand studies provide compelling evidence that activation of endogenous PPAR can produce similar effects .
Might PPAR have any beneficial effects on <termsem="GO:0006006"> glucose metabolism </term> in the lean condition ?
This has not been explored ; however , insulin resistance in the elderly is confined mostly to skeletal muscle and may be due to reduction of mitochondrial number and/or function ( Petersen et al. 2003 ) .
The ability of PPAR to stimulate mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> and oxidative function suggests that PPAR could be important for <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of insulin resistance during normal <termsem="GO:0007568"> aging </term> .
Together , these data indicate that PPAR and its ligands comprise a key molecular switch to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> muscle fiber <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> , obesity resistance , insulin sensitivity , and , most surprisingly , physical endurance .
This work demonstrates that complex physiologic properties such as fatigue , endurance , and running capacity can be genetically manipulated .
Animals .
The transactivation domain ( 78 amino acid residues , corresponding to residues 413 -- 490 ) of VP16 was fused in frame with the N-terminus of mouse PPAR .
