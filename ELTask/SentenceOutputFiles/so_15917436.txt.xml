<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding and helicase actions of mouse MCM4/6/7 helicase .
Helicases play central roles in initiation and elongation of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication .
We previously reported that helicase and ATPase activities of the mammalian Mcm4/6/7 complex are activated specifically by thymine-rich <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
Here , we examined its substrate preference and helicase actions using various <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNAs </term> .
On a bubble substrate , Mcm4/6/7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the 5  - proximal 25 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> adjacent to the branch points , presumably generating double hexamers .
Loss of thymine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> from one single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> results in significant decrease of unwinding efficacy , suggesting that concurrent bidirectional unwinding by a single double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 may play a role in efficient unwinding of the bubble .
Mcm4/6/7 binds and unwinds various fork and extension structures carrying a <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> 3  - tail <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
The extent of helicase activation depends on the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> context of the 3  - tail , and the maximum level is achieved by <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> with 50 % or more thymine content .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Strand </term> displacement by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited , as the GC content of the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> increases .
<termsem="SO:0000048"> Replacement </term> of cytosine -- guanine pairs with cytosine -- <termsem="SO:0001230"> inosine </term> pairs in the duplex restored unwinding , suggesting that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 helicase has difficulties in unwinding stably <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> - paired </term> duplex .
Taken together , these findings reveal important features on activation and substrate preference of the eukaryotic replicative helicase .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicases couple the hydrolysis of nucleotide or deoxynucleotide triphosphate to duplex unwinding ( 1 ) .
Coordination of a set of subactivities including nucleotide binding , <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding and ATP hydrolysis is required for unwinding of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> ( 1,2 ) .
The hexameric helicases , to which minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm ) helicase belongs , are known to assemble a ring-like structure ( 3 -- 5 ) .
Whereas most of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicases of this group , including simian virus 40 large T-antigen ( 6 ) , Escherichia coli DnaB ( 7 ) and Archaeal Mcm ( 4,8,9 ) , are composed of a single subunit , the active eukaryotic Mcm helicases are composed of two trimeric Mcm4/6/7 proteins ( 10 -- 14 ) .
All the six Mcm 2 -- 7 proteins contain highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - dependent ATPase motifs in their central <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> ( 15,16 ) .
Among the several stable subcomplexes which MCM proteins can generate , only the Mcm4/6/7 complex has been shown to possess an intrinsic <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase activity ( 10 -- 14,17 -- 18 ) .
While Mcm4 , Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins make distinct contribution to its helicase activity ( 11 -- 13 ) , Mcm2 or Mcm3/5 inhibit the helicase activity of the Mcm4/6/7 complex by converting its double trimer structure into a heterotetramer or heteropentamer , respectively ( 3,11 ) .
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> characterization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strongly suggested that Mcm is involved not only in initiation but also in the <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA chain </term> elongation stage as a replicative helicase ( 19,20 ) .
Consistent with this notion , the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse Mcm4/6/7 complexes is significantly stimulated on forked <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> structures and it can unwind <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> of 400 -- 500 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ( 13,14 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 binds to fork and bubble structures in an ATP-dependent manner , and generates a double-hexameric complex , as was shown for T-antigen ( 13,14,21 ) .
Recently , we reported that the helicase and ATP hydrolysis activities of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 are specifically activated by <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> containing stretches of thymine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> and proposed a novel model that Mcm may play a crucial role in selection of <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origins </term> in higher eukaryotes ( 13 ) .
In this report , in order to clarify the mode of action of the Mcm helicase and obtain insight into how it may function at the replication forks in vivo , we have conducted detailed analyses of helicase action and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding of mouse Mcm4/6/7 helicase using various forked and bubble substrate <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNAs </term> .
We specifically addressed <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> requirement for the Mcm helicase activation , mode of interaction with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> substrates and whether the thymine <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> are required for continuous activation of Mcm helicase during the unwinding process .
The results indicate that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 primarily binds to <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA region </term> , and that the extent of helicase activation is related to the thymine content of the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
Unexpectedly , Mcm4/6/7 helicase is not capable of efficiently unwinding the GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> , suggesting that some other mechanism may be required for completion of replication of the entire <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .

After addition of 2 l of 50 % glycerol , the reaction mixtures were directly applied on a polyacrylamide gel containing 6 mM magnesium acetate and 5 % glycerol in 0.5  TBE , and electrophoresis was conducted at room temperature .
For <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase assays , the reaction mixtures of the gel shift assays , as described above , were incubated at 30 C for 15 min , and then the ATP was added at 10 mM , followed by incubation at 37 C for additional 30 min .

Mcm4/6/7 complex primarily interacts with the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA segment </term> .
Mcm4/6/7 binds to ` bubble ' <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> substrates and unwinds the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> when the central <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> contains thymine <termsem="SO:0000001"> stretches </term> ( 13 ) .
In order to examine the mode of binding of Mcm4/6/7 on bubble <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNAs </term> , we conducted nuclease protection assays using labeled bubble substrate <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNAs </term> and Mcm4/6/7 in the presence of ATP--S which permits binding to substrate <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> but does not mobilize the helicase .
At an optimum concentration of DNase I , strong cleavages were detected on the 21 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> at both ends of the substrates , whereas weaker cleavages were detected on the central <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , consistent with preference of DNase I to <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
With the Bub66/T-rich substrate , strong protection was detected on the entire <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of both top and bottom <termsem="SO:0000001"> strands </term> with increasing concentration of Mcm4/6/7 , consistent with high affinity of Mcm4/6/7 to T-rich bubble <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> ( Figure 1A ) .
Similar , but less significant protection was detected on the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA segment </term> with P1 nucleases ( Figure 1A ) , which is specific to <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
The results indicate that the Mcm complex is loaded onto bubble <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> through binding to both <termsem="SO:0000001"> strands </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
Careful examination of Mcm4/6/7 footprints on a bubble indicated strong protection on the 5  - half of the top <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> and moderate protection on the remaining 3  - half , as well as on several <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> - pair </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> adjacent to the branch point ( Figure 1A and data not shown ) .
A similar pattern of protection was observed also on the bottom <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> .
This suggests that Mcm4/6/7 may bind to a replication bubble substrate with a 2-fold symmetry as a double hexamer ( Figure 1A , see the lower scheme ) , in a manner similar to SV40 T-antigen ( 21 ) .
Nuclease protection assays were conducted also on a T-tailed Y-fork structure ( Figure 1B ) .
Not only the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> tail <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> but also the 7 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> adjacent to the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> - to - <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000699"> junction </term> were protected by Mcm binding from DNaseI digestion .
These results indicate that Mcm4/6/7 protein primarily interacts with <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA region </term> and that the interaction also spans the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> near the branchpoint of the replication fork .
Formation of double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 complexes facilitates helicase actions on bubble substrates .
The above results suggest that Mcm4/6/7 generates a double hexameric complex on a bubble , each hexamer of which makes symmetric contact with the 5  - proximal central <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
This predicts that the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> needs to be of a sufficient length in order to accommodate the Mcm complex .
In fact , we previously showed that the Mcm4/6/7 mainly forms a single hexameric complex on bubble-20 ( a bubble substrate with 20 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long central <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> ) and a double hexameric complex on bubble-60 <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> ( 13 ) .
In order to determine the minimum requirement for double-hexamer formation , a set of <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> bubble-like substrates ( Bub-T10 , Bub-T20 , Bub-T30 , Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 ) that differed in the length of the central <termsem="SO:0000984"> unpaired </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> were constructed , and the binding and helicase activities of Mcm4/6/7 on these substrates were examined .
Mcm4/6/7 was incubated with a radiolabeled <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> bubble substrate in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP--S to allow complex formation .
A half of these reaction mixtures were analyzed for <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding in gel shift assays ( Figure 2A ) , and the remainder was further incubated in the presence of 10 mM ATP to measure <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase activity ( Figure 2B ) .
Bub-10 generated only a low level of complexes with Mcm4/6/7 , and Bub-20 generated primarily a single mobility-shifted form , which may contain a single hexamer of Mcm4/6/7 .
On Bub-30 , significant amount of complexes containing a double hexamer were generated in addition to those containing a single hexamer ( Figure 2A ) ( 13,21 ) .
The amounts of double hexamer complexes increased on Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 with concomitant decrease of single hexamer complexes ( Figure 2A ) .
The results indicate that a <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> of at least 40 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long is required for efficient loading of the double-hexameric Mcm helicase on a bubble substrate .
In <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase assays , Mcm4/6/7 complex did not show helicase activity on either Bub-10 or Bub-20 substrate .
The efficiency of displacement slightly improved as the length of the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> increased up to 30 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> .
On Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 , on the other hand , significant displacement was observed , indicating that a <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> of at least 40 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long is required for efficient helicase actions on bubble substrates ( Figure 2B ) .
Taken together , the above results are consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 complex , loaded onto <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> as a double hexameric complex , efficiently unwinds the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of the substrate <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
Both <termsem="SO:0000001"> strands </term> of thymine-rich <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> are required for efficient unwinding of bubble <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> by Mcm4/6/7 .
Symmetric binding of the Mcm4/6/7 double hexamer to bubble suggests that each hexamer catalyzes unwinding of one of the two <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> .
We asked whether activation of both hexamers is required for unwinding of the bubble substrate .
The preferred bubble substrate which is efficiently unwound by Mcm4/6/7 contains thymine <termsem="SO:0000001"> stretches </term> on both <termsem="SO:0000001"> strands </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
We constructed a hetero-bubble ( Bub66/T -- G-rich ) in which one <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> is T-rich ( same as Bub66/T-rich ) and the other <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> is G-rich ( same as Bub66/G-rich ) ( 13 ) , and helicase assays were conducted with increasing amount of Mcm4/6/7 .
Only weak unwinding was detected on this substrate compared to Bub66/T-rich ( Figure 3A ) .
Since Mcm4/6/7 can bind to Bub66/T -- G-rich and forms a double hexameric complex ( data not shown ) , the defective unwinding is not due to inefficient loading of the helicase onto the substrate .
If one hexamer interacting with the thymine-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> dissociates from the other hexamer and displaces only one of the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> , then it would result in generation of Y-fork structures which could not be further displaced due to the presence of G-rich 3  - tail and would appear on the gel .
However , we did not detect such intermediates during the course of the experiment ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that bubble can be displaced efficiently only when two molecules of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamers are simultaneously activated .
Binding and helicase actions of Mcm4/6/7 on forked and 3  - or 5  - extension substrates .
In order to examine more precisely the interaction and helicase actions with forked substrates , Y-fork substrates containing a nascent leading <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> ( A-fork [ 3  ] ) , nascent lagging <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> ( A-fork [ 5  ] ) , or both of them ( A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] ) , as well as 5  - extension or 3  - extension structures were constructed .
Mcm4/6/7 bound to A-fork [ 3  ] or A-fork [ 5  ] with affinity similar to that of a simple Y-fork ( Figure 4A and data not shown ) .
In contrast , PriA helicase , used as a control , bound to A-fork [ 3  ] more efficiently than to A-fork [ 5  ] , as reported previously ( 23,25 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 bound also to 5  - extension and 3  - extension , albeit with slightly reduced affinity compared to A-fork [ 3  ] and A-fork [ 5  ] ( Figure 4A ) .
Mcm4/6/7 bound to A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] with much lower affinity , and the complex gave rise to a single band .
These findings indicate that the Mcm4/6/7 complex is loaded onto <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> preferentially and efficiently through <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , regardless of the presence of 3  - or 5  - terminus .
In contrast , only the substrate containing a 3  <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> tail ( A-fork [ 5  ] ) was efficiently unwound and A-fork [ 3  ] or A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] , was not unwound by Mcm4/6/7 ( Figure 4B ) .
Absence of helicase actions on A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] composed only of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> is expected since <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> is not able to activate the ATPase activity of Mcm4/6/7 ( 10 ) .
In contrast , the PriA , a structure-specific helicase used as a control , binds at the fork <termsem="SO:0000699"> junction </term> and unwinds the fork and the nascent lagging <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> on A-fork [ 5  ] , or unwinds the nascent lagging <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> on A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] , as reported before ( 25 ) .
These results indicate that the Mcm4/6/7 complex binds to <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> and that its helicase is activated only in the presence of a <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> 3  - tail .
3  - extension with poly ( dT ) tail is displaced by Mcm4/6/7 .
It has been reported that the 3  - extension can be unwound by the archaeal Mcm homohexamer but not by fission and budding yeast Mcm complexes ( 14,26,27 ) .
We have constructed 3  - extension substrates containing poly ( dT ) , poly ( dA ) , poly ( dC ) and poly ( dG ) 3  - tails in order to examine whether mouse Mcm4/6/7 can displace these substrates .
We first found that Mcm4/6/7 binds to dT - , dC - and dG-3  - extension with similar affinity , and to dA-3  - extension with much lower affinity ( Figure 5A ) .
This is consistent with the previous results that Mcm4/6/7 binds to 50mer <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> - dT , - dC and - dG , but not to a 50mer <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> - dA ( 13 ) .
We found that dT-tailed 3  - extension was displaced efficiently by Mcm 4/6/7 while almost no or very little activity was detected on other substrates ( Figure 5B and C ) .
This is in sharp contrast to yeast Mcm4/6/7 helicases which are not capable of unwinding 3  - extension substrates .
Furthermore , dT-tailed 5  - extension , to which Mcm4/6/7 could bind , was not displaced by the Mcm helicase .
The addition of the 5  - tail to dT-tailed 3  - extension further stimulated the displacement ( Figure 5D ) , confirming the previous report that the fork structures facilitate the helicase action .
Thus , these results further strengthen our conclusion that the mammalian Mcm helicase is generally activated by the thymine - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stretch </term> on the 3  - <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> tail .
The effects of the thymine content of the 3  - tail on Mcm helicase activity .
We next examined more systematically the effect of the compositions of the thymine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> of the 3  - tail on the Mcm helicase activity .
A partial heteroduplex M13 <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> containing a 37 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> in the presence or absence of the 50 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long 3  - tail of various <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> compositions were constructed and the unwinding by mouse Mcm4/6/7 was examined ( Figure 6A ) .
Due to its low processivity , Mcm4/6/7 barely displaced the annealed 37mer <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> without a 3  - tail ( 37mer ; Figure 6A ) .
Only weak helicase activity was observed on the substrate carrying the 3  - tail of 25 <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of TA dinucleotide ( 37-TA25 ; Figure 6A ) , whereas strong helicase activity was observed on 37-TTA17 .
Increase of thymine content on the 3  - tail did not further increase the extent of unwinding ( 37-TTTA13 , 37-TTTTA10 and 37-T50 ; Figure 6A ) , suggesting that 17 <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of TT dinucleotides ( 67 % thymine ) may be sufficient for activation of Mcm helicase .
It should be noted that the TA25 tail would self-anneal and this would prevent the loading of Mcm , since the 3  - tail containing TTAA13 or TTTAAA8 did not enhance the unwinding either ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we next examined the effects of <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeating sequences </term> </term> of thymine and cytosine ( Figure 6B ) .
Partial heteroduplex substrates containing the 3  - tail of TC25 , TTCC13 , TTTCCC8 , TTTTCCCC6 , TTCC17 were displaced by the Mcm4/6/7 complex to the extent similar to that achieved by TTA17 , suggesting that 50 % thymine content is sufficient for full activation of Mcm helicase .
TTCC13 and TTCC17 were displaced to a similar extent , consistent with the earlier result that a 40 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> tail is sufficient for activation ( 13 ) .
However , the efficiency of the displacement significantly decreased as the thymine content of the 3  - tail dropped to 33 % , as in TAA17 or TCC17 ( Figure 6B and C ) .
Thus , the minimal thymine content required for activation of the Mcm helicase may be somewhere between 33 and 50 % .
DUE <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from the c-myc <termsem="SO:0000296"> origin </term> activate Mcm helicase .
Our previous studies have shown that the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> containing periodic ( dT ) n <termsem="SO:0000001"> tracts </term> derived from the human lamin B2 <termsem="SO:0000296"> origin </term> ( 48 % thymine content ) can serve as an efficient activator for the Mcm helicase on a bubble , and <termsem="SO:0000048"> replacement </term> of thymines with guanines abolished the helicase activation ( 13,28 ) .
In order to examine other <termsem="SO:0000782"> natural </term> <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origins </term> with different thymine contents for the ability to activate Mcm helicase on a bubble substrate , we constructed new bubble substrates , Bub82/c-myc , containing <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> derived from the DUE ( <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> unwinding element ) <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of the human c-myc <termsem="SO:0000296"> origin </term> which is essential for c-myc replicator activity ( 29,30 ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000984"> unpaired </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> in Bub82/c-myc/DUE contains one <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> of DUE and that in Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C contains another <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> .
This DUE is believed to coincide with the initially unwound <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of the c-myc <termsem="SO:0000296"> origin </term> ( 29 ) , and its <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> substantially reduced the replicator activity ( 30 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 unwound Bub82/lamin B2 ( thymine 48 % ) , Bub82/c-myc/DUE ( 37 % ) and Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C ( 39 % ) with similar efficiency ( Figure 7A ) , indicating that the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from the c-myc <termsem="SO:0000296"> origin </term> also can serve as efficient activators of the Mcm helicase .
This result also indicates that <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> with 37 % thymine content can activate Mcm4/6/7 to displace 24 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> duplex on both sides in a bubble substrate , suggesting that the not only thymine content but also the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> context may affect the Mcm helicase activation .
In gel shift assays , MCM4/6/7 bound to all the three bubbles , although the affinity to Bub82/c-myc/DUE and to Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C is slightly lower than that to Bub-82 / lamin B2 ( Figure 7B ) .
Therefore , helicase and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding activities do not necessarily correlate with each other .
This was also indicated by our previous results that guanine and cytosine <termsem="SO:0000001"> stretches </term> can bind to Mcm but can not activate the helicase ( 13 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> unwinding by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited by the GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> on the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
Our results indicate that thymine-rich <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> is required for initial loading and activation of the Mcm helicase .
However , it is not known whether thymine <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> are required for processive unwinding of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
Therefore , we have examined whether the <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> composition of the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> affects its unwinding activity .
To address this issue , we constructed a series of T-tailed Y-fork structures ( T-fork ) containing various <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
They carried varied contents of cytosine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> on the 3  - tail <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> .
In gel shift assays , Mcm4/6/7 bound to these Y-fork substrates with identical affinity ( Figure 8A ) , consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 binds to <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> tails .
However , in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase assays , T-fork / ( C : G ) 49 was hardly displaced by Mcm4/6/7 , but was readily displaced by SV40 T-antigen <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase ( Figure 8B ) .
When thymine or adenine is <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> as every third <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of CCT or CCA ) , the extent of unwinding increased ( T-fork / ( CCT : GGA ) 16 and T-fork / ( CCA : GGT ) 16 ) .
The efficiency of unwinding is roughly correlated with the content of GC pairs in the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> [ T-fork / ( CCAA : GGTT ) 12 , T-fork / ( CCTT : GGAA ) 12 , T-fork / ( CAAA : GTTT ) 12 and T-fork / ( CTTT : GAAA ) 12 ; Figure 8B ] .
It appears that the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> containing < 50 % GC pairs is efficiently unwound ( Figure 8C ) .
We next examined the effect of GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> on a partial heteroduplex <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> on a <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000988"> circular </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
We have constructed two sets of 5  - tailed partial heteroduplex <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> substrates containing <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of variable lengths ; one on M13mp18 <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> and the other on M13mp19 containing a 66 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long G-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> downstream of the hybridizing <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> .
We found that the Mcm4/6/7 helicase can displace <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> up to 350 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long on its own on the former substrate ( Figure 8D , left ) , consistent with previous results ( 13 ) .
In contrast , displacement was inhibited over the GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> on the latter substrate ( Figure 8D , right panel ) , although displacement up to 250 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> in length , albeit at a reduced level , was observed at a high concentration of Mcm4/6/7 complex .
This result is consistent with that on Y-fork and indicates that GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> is inhibitory for unwinding by the Mcm helicase .
These results may indicate that the presence of thymine -- adenine <termsem="SO:0000028"> pairs </term> with a certain frequency in the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> may facilitate continuous unwinding by Mcm4/6/7 .
Alternatively , Mcm4/6/7 is not efficient enough to displace thermodynamically stable GC - <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> - paired </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
In order to distinguish these two possibilities , we designed a new T-fork substrate containing inosine ( <termsem="SO:0001230"> I </term> ) residue instead of guanosine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residue </term> .
The thermal stability of the <termsem="SO:0001230"> I </term> : C <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> is lower than that of the G : C <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> in <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> due to loss of one hydrogen bond and is even lower than A : T <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> ( 31 ) .
We constructed the T-tailed fork substrates containing the ( GCC : CGG ) 10 , ( GCC : CIG ) 10 or ( GAA : CTT ) 10 <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA segment </term> ( Figure 8E ) .
Mcm4/6/7 hardly displaced the 31 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long duplex of GCC : CGG <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> , whereas the T-fork / ( GAA : CTT ) 10 was displaced efficiently , as described above .
T-fork / ( GCC : CIG ) 10 was displaced with efficiency much greater than that of T-fork / ( GCC : CGG ) 10 , indicating that the thermostability of the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> , not the lack of AT <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> , is responsible for inability of Mcm4/6/7 to displace the duplex .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase is a central factor for operation of replication forks .
It also plays a crucial role in the initiation step at the <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origins </term> .
Therefore , the elucidation of how the replicative helicases interact with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> substrate and how they are activated is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of initiation of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication .
It is now believed that Mcm is a major component of the eukaryotic replicative helicase .
In this report , we have conducted detailed analyses on binding and helicase actions of mouse Mcm4/6/7 using various substrates including fork and bubble structures .
Modes of binding and activation of Mcm4/6/7 helicase on a bubble structure .
Initiation of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication is associated with localized melting of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> near <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origins </term> .
Helicases are loaded onto replication forks through the melted <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , induced by initiator binding , in bacteria ( 32 ) .
We previously reported that Mcm4/6/7 can be loaded onto a bubble-like structure and can serve as a <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> helicase at the forks ( 13 ) .
The ability of Mcm4/6/7 to unwind the bubble substrate but not the conventional <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> ( Figures 2 and 13 ) indicates that Mcm can be loaded through the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> of the bubble .
Furthermore , the Mcm4/6/7 complex displays marked preference for thymine-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> for helicase activation ( 13 ) .
The results in this report indicate that helicase action of Mcm4/6/7 on <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> bubbles may depend on the presence of an <termsem="SO:0000984"> unpaired </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of sufficient length ( at least 40 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> ) , which may permit assembly of a double-hexameric complex on the substrate <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> , similar to SV40 T-antigen protein ( Figure 2A ) ( 21 ) .
When one <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> in T-rich bubble was <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaced </term> by guanine-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> , the efficiency of unwinding was significantly reduced .
Our footprinting analyses showed that Mcm4/6/7 strongly protects 25 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA segment </term> adjacent to each branch point and proximal to 5  ends of both <termsem="SO:0000001"> strands </term> of the bubble .
At each fork , one Mcm4/6/7 complex is likely to encircle the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> </term> and two hexamers may bind symmetrically to the bubble substrate , forming a double hexameric structure on the bubble ( see schematic drawing of Figure 1A ) .
Efficient unwinding into both directions may require simultaneous activation of both hexamers which may sit at the center while extruding the unwound <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> through the rings .
This may closely resemble the proposed modes of binding and helicase actions of T-antigen ( 21 ) .
Although we can not totally exclude the possibility that one Mcm4/6/7 hexamer at each fork unwinds the duplex independently , ring-shaped structures of mouse and archea MCM , as revealed by electron microscopy , bear much similarity to the recently solved structure of the SV40 large T-antigen ( 4,6 ) , and are in favor of the double-hexameric structure of mouse Mcm on a bubble <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
Substrate and <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> requirement for Mcm4/6/7 helicase activation .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding assays indicate that Mcm4/6/7 binds to those substrates containing <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA regions </term> regardless of the presence or absence of <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> 3  or 5  end .
Unwinding of the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> depends on <termsem="SO:0000049"> translocation </term> of <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> from 3  to 5  direction .
This is most clearly shown by its helicase action on A-fork [ 5  ] and 3  - extension but not on A-fork [ 3  ] , A-fork [ 3  ,5  ] nor 5  - extension .
However , it does not necessarily require 3  end of <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> , since Mcm4/6/7 can displace annealing <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> on a <termsem="SO:0000988"> circular </term> <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
The ability of the mouse Mcm4/6/7 to unwind 3  - extension is shared by the archaeal Mcm helicase but not by Mcm4/6/7 from S.pombe and S.cerevisiae ( 14,26,27 ) .
The archaeal Mcm can unwind A-fork [ 3  ] but eukaryotic Mcm4/6/7 can not , since the former binds to <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> but the latter does not ( 5,27 ) .
While yeast Mcm helicases can <termsem="SO:0000049"> translocate </term> on <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> , such activity was not observed with mammalian Mcm4/6/7 ( data not shown ) .
Occurrence of AT-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> , with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine , near the <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origins </term> , lead us to propose that Mcm may play a role in selection of initiation <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> of mammalian <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication , and prompted us to examine the ability of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from human <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origins </term> to activate Mcm4/6/7 helicase .
Both lamin-B2 and c-myc <termsem="SO:0000296"> origins </term> served as efficient activator for Mcm helicase in vitro .
Consistent with it , <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> - specific loading of Mcm in the <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication initiation <termsem="SO:0000001"> zone </term> of the c-myc was recently reported ( 33 ) .
We have examined in detail the effect of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> context of the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> on the helicase activity of Mcm .
The results indicate that thymine content of 50 % is sufficient for the maximum helicase activity .
The efficiency of displacement decreased as the thymine content of the 3  - tail dropped to 33 % ( Figure 6 ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> stretches </term> of thymine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> may not be necessarily required , since <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of TC dinucleotides served as a potent activator for Mcm4/6/7 .
We also noticed that the presence of a <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> is inhibitory for helicase action .
Nuclease footprinting assays indicated that binding was interfered by the <termsem="SO:0001078"> secondary structure </term> ( data not shown ) .
Thus , we have concluded that Mcm4/6/7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non-structured <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> with thymine content of 50 % or more , although significant stimulation is observed also by <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> with less thymine content ( Figure 7 ) , suggesting that the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> specificity for Mcm helicase activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> context .
This would be reasonable given the flexibility and differential regulation of <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> selection for initiation of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication during development or in various cell types , as well as the variability in initiation potential of each <termsem="SO:0000296"> replication origin </term> on the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> even within the single cell type .
Mcm4/6/7 helicase during processive unwinding at the fork .
The specific requirement of <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> thymine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> for activation of Mcm helicase prompted us to examine whether they are required also for processive unwinding of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
Our results indicated that increase of GC <termsem="SO:0000028"> pair </term> in the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> significantly inhibited the Mcm helicase activity .
<termsem="SO:0000985"> Duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> composed only of GC <termsem="SO:0000028"> pairs </term> ( 10 <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of CGG ) on a Y-fork was not displaced at all , while the same template was readily displaced by SV40 T-antigen ( Figure 8B ) .
Mcm helicase was inhibited by the presence of GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> also on a <termsem="SO:0000988"> circular </term> <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> partial heteroduplex substrate .
However , on this substrate , Mcm4/6/7 was able to displace <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> past the GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , albeit to a limited extent , when it was added at a high concentration .
On the partial heteroduplex template , Mcm is loaded onto the <termsem="SO:0000988"> circular </term> <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> of 6.4 kb , while it is loaded onto the 50 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> long 3  - tail <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> on the Y-fork .
Thus , the difference of helicase actions may reflect the efficiency of Mcm loading .
Alternatively , the presence of ` <termsem="SO:0000449"> random </term> ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> at the initially unwound <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> in the former template may engage the Mcm helicase in a more active conformation which can displace the GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> .
On Y-fork substrates , increase of AT <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> in the duplex ( 10 <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> of CTT ) restored the unwinding .
These results indicate either that thymine <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> are required on the <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> for continuous unwinding , or that Mcm4/6/7 is simply not efficient enough to unwind the stable GC <termsem="SO:0000028"> pairs </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000048"> Replacement </term> of the central guanosine with <termsem="SO:0001230"> inosine </term> in the CGG <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> resulted in displacement ( Figure 8E ) ( 31 ) , suggesting that the continuous presence of AT <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> may not be essential for the Mcm helicase function and that the thermostability of GC <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> is inhibitory for helicase action of Mcm4/6/7 .
The results described in this manuscript reveal potentially important features of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 helicase , which is likely to be a key component of the eukaryotic replicative helicase .
Prior to initiation of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication , Mcm helicase may adopt a double hexameric complex at the partially melted <termsem="SO:0000296"> origin </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , and may catalyze concurrent unwinding of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> into both directions , while stably associated with the <termsem="SO:0000296"> origins of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication </term> .
This is similar to the T-antigen model originally proposed by Smelkova and Borowiec ( 21 ) .
We propose that , only when both hexamers are activated by the interacting thymine-rich <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> present within the melted <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , the Mcm helicase is mobilized and initiation takes place .
A crucial question is how these double hexameric helicase complexes are generated and turn into active helicases at the <termsem="SO:0000296"> origins </term> .
This process would involve melting of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> , which may be facilitated by binding of preRC components in the context of proper chromatin structures , or by other unwinding factors including a topoisomerase or a newly identified Mcm8 helicase ( 34 -- 36 ) .
It may also require association of fork-assisting proteins such as Cdc45 ( 37,38 ) as well as phosphorylation events by Cdk and Cdc7 kinases ( 39,40 ) .
One unexpected finding of this study is low helicase activity of Mcm4/6/7 on GC-rich <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> .
This , in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4/6/7 helicase , strongly indicates that the replicative helicase at the replication forks would require more than Mcm4/6/7 complex .
During the processive unwinding of <termsem="SO:0000985"> duplex </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> replication forks , Mcm4/6/7 may be further stimulated by interaction with other proteins , including remaining Mcm subunits , Cdc45 ( 37,38 ) , GINS ( 41,42 ) , <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> polymerase subunits ( 43 ) , Mcm8 ( 35,36 ) , etc. to become a truly processive and potent helicase capable of replicating the entire <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
