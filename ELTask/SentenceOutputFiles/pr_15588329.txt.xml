Membrane trafficking and mitochondrial abnormalities precede <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> deposition in a cerebellar cell model of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis .
JNCL is a recessively inherited , childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease most-commonly caused by a ~ 1 kb <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> mutation .
The resulting loss of <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> activity leads to deposition of <termsem="PR:000022190"> mitochondrial ATP synthase , subunit c </term> and a specific loss of CNS neurons .
We previously generated Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice , which replicate the common JNCL mutation , express mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> and display JNCL-like pathology .
To elucidate the consequences of the common JNCL mutation in neuronal cells , we used P4 knock-in mouse cerebella to establish conditionally immortalized CbCln3 wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous neuronal precursor cell lines , which can be differentiated into <termsem="PR:000010124"> MAP-2 </term> and NeuN-positive , neuron-like cells .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells express low levels of mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> and , when aged at confluency , accumulate <termsem="PR:000022190"> ATPase subunit c </term> .
Recessive phenotypes are also observed at sub-confluent growth ; <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> transport and processing are altered , although enzyme activity is not significantly affected , lysosomal size and distribution are altered , and endocytosis is reduced .
In addition , mitochondria are abnormally elongated , cellular ATP levels are decreased , and survival following oxidative stress is reduced .
These findings reveal that <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> is required for intracellular membrane trafficking and mitochondrial function .
Moreover , these deficiencies are likely to be early events in the JNCL disease process and may particularly impact neuronal survival .
Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( JNCL ) , or Batten disease , is a recessively inherited childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive blindness , seizures , motor and cognitive decline , and early death [ 1 ] .
The primary genetic defect ( > 80 % disease chromosomes ) leading to JNCL is a 1.02 kb genomic DNA deletion in the <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> gene , which eliminates exons 7 and 8 and surrounding intronic DNA , predicting a non-functional protein product [ 2 ] .
The pathological hallmark of JNCL is autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin deposits within autolysosomes that are enriched in <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex </term> [ 3-5 ] .
Remarkably , these deposits are not only found in CNS neurons but are also abundant in non-neuronal cells outside of the nervous system .
The relationship of <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> deposits to the JNCL disease process , and the underlying reason for the neuronal specificity of the disease remain poorly understood .
The <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> - encoded protein ( <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> , also called <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> or <termsem="PR:000005591"> cln3 p </term> ) is a highly conserved , ubiquitously expressed , multi-pass membrane protein [ 6 ] that localizes to the lysosome and other vesicular compartments [ 7-9 ] .
<termsem="PR:000005591"> Battenin </term> function remains to be elucidated , although studies of <termsem="PR:000005591"> btn1 </term> , the yeast <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> ortholog , have implicated <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> in lysosomal pH homeostasis and amino acid transport [ 10,11 ] .
To explore JNCL pathogenesis and <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> function , we previously generated a genetically precise JNCL mouse model .
Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice harbor the ~ 1 kb common JNCL mutation and express a non-truncated mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> isoform that is detectable with antibodies recognizing C-terminal epitopes .
Homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice exhibit a progressive JNCL-like disease , with perinatal onset of <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> deposition in many cell types and later onset of neuronal dysfunction and behavioral deficits [ 12 ] .
These findings suggest that the major JNCL defect leads to abnormal turnover of <termsem="PR:000022190"> mitochondrial subunit c </term> , in a manner that selectively compromises CNS neurons .
Currently , there is no suitable neuronal cell system to investigate the impact of the common JNCL mutation on biological processes .
Therefore , we have established cerebellar neuronal precursor cell lines from Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells exhibit pathological hallmarks of the disease , and a survey of membrane organelles revealed membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction in homozygous mutant CbCln3ex7/8 cells .
Generation of a genetically precise cerebellar JNCL cell model .
To generate a precise genetic , neuron-derived JNCL cell culture system , we immortalized granule neurons cultured from postnatal day 4 ( P4 ) cerebella of homozygous and heterozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice , and wild-type littermates .
Primary cell cultures enriched for granule neurons were transduced with retroviral vector bearing a selection cassette and temperature-sensitive tsA58 SV40 large T antigen .
Growth in G418 containing medium at the permissive temperature ( 33 C ) allowed for selection and isolation of multiple clonal <termsem="PR:000011141"> nestin </term> - positive ( Fig. 1a ) , and <termsem="PR:000007939"> GFAP </term> - negative ( Fig. 1b ) , cell lines for each genotype .
No genotype specific differences were observed in cellular morphology or doubling time ( ~ 46 hours ) ( data not shown ) .
As expected , SV40 large T antigen expression was rapidly lost and cell division ceased when cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature ( 39 C ) ( data not shown ) .
Upon addition of neuronal differentiation cocktail , precursor cells became neuron-like in morphology and exhibited decreased <termsem="PR:000011141"> nestin </term> expression ( data not shown ) and increased <termsem="PR:000010124"> MAP2 </term> and NeuN expression ( Fig. 1c ,1 d ) , but not expression of the Purkinje marker , <termsem="PR:000004967"> calbindin </term> ( Fig. 1e ) .
Neuronal marker expression in CbCln3 + / + cells Characterization of CbCln3 + / + cells by immunofluorescence with marker antibodies is shown .
CbCln3 + / + precursors exhibit <termsem="PR:000011141"> nestin </term> expression ( a ) but not <termsem="PR:000007939"> GFAP </term> expression ( b ) , consistent with a neuronal precursor identity .
Upon stimulation with a differentiation cocktail ( see Methods ) , CbCln3 + / + cells achieved neuron-like morphology , with rounded cell bodies and extension of processes , and <termsem="PR:000010124"> MAP2 </term> ( c ) and NeuN ( d ) expression was increased .
CbCln3 + / + cells are negative for the Purkinje neuron marker <termsem="PR:000004967"> calbindin </term> ( e ) .
CbCln3 + / ex7/8 and CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 cell lines exhibited identical marker immunofluorescence results .

Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells express mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> and display JNCL-like pathology .
Homozygous Cb Cln3ex7/8 cells were first examined for JNCL-like characteristics .
Homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice express multiple <termsem="PR:000005591"> Cln3 </term> mRNA splice variants and mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> protein that is detectable by batp1 antibody recognizing C-terminal epitopes [ 12 ] .
To assess this molecular phenotype in CbCln3ex7/8 cells , RT-PCR and anti- <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> ( batp1 ) immunostaining were performed .
As shown in Figure 2 , <termsem="PR:000005591"> Cln3 </term> mRNA isoforms in wild-type and homozygous cells were similar to those observed in total RNA isolated from wild-type or homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in brain , respectively ( Fig. 2 ) .
In addition , batp1 immunostaining detected mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> product in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , in a similar albeit reduced cytoplasmic , vesicular staining pattern as that seen in wild-type cells .
Batp1 signal exhibited some overlap with the lysosomal marker , <termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp1 </term> , but had more significant overlap with <termsem="PR:000006901"> early endosome antigen 1 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000006901"> EEA1 </term> ) and the late endosomal marker , <termsem="PR:000013639"> Rab7 </term> ( Fig. 3 ) .
Only limited overlap was observed with recycling endosomes , as determined by <termsem="PR:000001945"> <termsem="PR:000016261"> transferrin </term> receptor </term> co-staining ( data not shown ) .
Intriguingly , <termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000006901"> EEA1 </term> immunocytochemical distribution were altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , with less perinuclear clustering than in wild-type cells , and <termsem="PR:000013639"> Rab7 </term> staining was frequently less intense in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( Fig. 3 ) .
Heterozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells contained a mixture of <termsem="PR:000005591"> Cln3 </term> mRNA products from both the wild-type allele and the mutant allele , and batp1 signal was similar to that seen in wild-type cells ( data not shown ) .
RT-PCR of <termsem="PR:000005591"> Cln3 </term> mRNA in wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells <termsem="PR:000005591"> Cln3 </term> Exon1-forward , Exon 15-reverse RT-PCR products are shown , from total wild-type ( + / + ) or homozygous mutant ( ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) brain and cell line RNA .
Brain and cell line RT-PCR reaction products had identical band patterns on ethidium-bromide stained agarose gels .
Wild-type RT-PCR product was a single ~ 1.6 kb band and mutant products were ~ 1.6 , ~ 1.5 , ~ 1.4 , ~ 1.35 , and ~ 1.3 kb , representing multiple mutant splice variants .

Significant overlap of Batp1 signal ( red ) with <termsem="PR:000006901"> EEA1 </term> ( green , middle panels ) and <termsem="PR:000013639"> Rab7 </term> ( green , bottom panels ) can be seen as yellow when the two channels are merged ( Merge ) .
The degree of Batp1 overlap is greatest with <termsem="PR:000013639"> Rab7 </term> .
Only limited overlap between Batp1 ( red ) and <termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp 1 </term> ( green , top panels ) can be seen .
Batp1 signal in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells is significantly reduced , but significant overlap with <termsem="PR:000006901"> EEA1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013639"> Rab7 </term> , and very little <termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp 1 </term> overlap , can be seen as yellow in the respective merged panels .
Notably , <termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp </term> 1 and <termsem="PR:000006901"> EEA1 </term> localization appear altered , and <termsem="PR:000013639"> Rab7 </term> staining was frequently less intense in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells .
Wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 confocal images were captured with identical exposure settings .
60  magnification .
During sub-confluent growth conditions , neither wild-type nor homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells displayed autofluorescence or <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> inclusion formation ( data not shown ) .
However , when cells were aged at confluency ( 3 + days post-confluency ) , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cellular <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> levels were elevated beyond normal wild-type levels by immunostaining ( Fig. 4a ) and immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 4b ) .
Autofluorescent signal sometimes overlapped with <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> signal , but also was elevated more diffusely ( Fig. 4a ) .
Moreover , although multilamellar `` fingerprint '' profiles were not detected , confluency-aged homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells displayed numerous ultrastructural abnormalities including electron dense inclusions characteristic of lipofuscin and large autophagosomes that contained dense core structures , degenerating mitochondria , and many smaller vesicles ( Fig. 4c ) .
Inclusion bodies and autophagosomes were infrequently observed in confluency-aged wild-type cultures ( data not shown ) .

Wild-type cultures ( CbCln3 + / + ) exhibited limited <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> immunostaining and autofluorescence .
However , CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 cells contained numerous <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> puncta .
Autofluorescence ( 7 days AF ) was also significantly elevated ( right panels ) , although limited overlap with <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> puncta was observed ( arrows ) .

b. Immunoblot analysis of <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> protein at sub-confluency or 7-day confluency incubation is shown .
Total protein extracts from sub-confluency wild-type ( + / + ) and homozygous mutant ( ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) cultures contained approximately equal levels of <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> protein (  - <termsem="PR:000022190"> sub c </term> ) .
7-day confluency extract from homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) had elevated levels of <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> protein ( ~ 1.5 X ) , relative to wild-type extract ( + / + ) .
Protein levels were normalized to <termsem="PR:000005776"> <termsem="PR:000002199"> cytochrome c </term> oxidase subunit IV </term> (  - <termsem="PR:000005776"> cox4 </term> ) .

Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells and Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice process <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> abnormally .
We next investigated the basis for <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> accumulation , testing the hypothesis that <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> is abnormal since it is required for <termsem="PR:000022190"> ATP synthase subunit c </term> degradation in the lysosome [ 13 ] .
We first tested <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> transport and processing in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells and Cln3ex7/8 mice using anti- <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> antibody that recognizes unprocessed and processed cathepsin D isoforms .
Immunostaining of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells revealed a perinuclear and punctate vesicular <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> distribution , consistent with its transport and processing through the secretory pathway and delivery to the lysosome ( Fig. 5a ) .
However , in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> distribution was less vesicular and more perinuclear-clustered than in wild-type cells .
Immunoblots of homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cell and Cln3ex7/8 tissue extracts also showed altered relative levels of <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> isoforms ( Fig. 5b ) .
<termsem="PR:000006025"> Cathepsin D </term> isoforms , identified by relative molecular weights , represent the ~ 45 kDa precursor , the ~ 43 kDa intermediate single chain form of the enzyme , and the 31 kDa heavy chain of the double-chain form of the mature enzyme [ 14 ] .
In homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cell and Cln3ex7/8 tissue extracts , the precursor and heavy chains were reduced , and the single chain was slightly elevated compared to wild-type extracts .
The cellular growth media did not contain altered levels of <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> , indicating enzyme secretion was not affected .
Heterozygous Cln3ex7/8 mice and CbCln3ex7/8 cells were indistinguishable from wild-type , as expected for a recessive disease phenotype ( data not shown ) .
<termsem="PR:000006025"> Cathepsin D </term> localization and processing in wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells a. Immunostaining of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells with anti- <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> antibody , recognizing unprocessed and processed forms of cathepsin D protein is shown .
CbCln3 + / + cells ( left panel ) exhibited a perinuclear and cytoplasmic punctate signal .
<termsem="PR:000006025"> Cathepsin D </term> signal in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( right panel ) was more often perinuclear , with less cytoplasmic punctate signal , compared to wild-type CbCln3 + / + cells .

b.  - <termsem="PR:000006025"> Cathepsin D </term> - probed immunoblots of total wild-type versus homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in tissue or CbCln3ex7/8 cellular extracts are shown .
The ~ 45 kDa <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> band , representing precursor , was the predominant band in wild-type ( wt ) tissue and cellular extracts , with lower levels of mature enzyme ( single chain , ~ 43 kDa , and heavy chain , ~ 31 kDa ) .
Conversely , homozygous Cln3ex7/8 and CbCln3ex7/8 mutant ( m ) extracts exhibited reduced levels of precursor and heavy chain of the double-chain form of the enzyme , with elevated levels of single-chain mature enzyme .
The impact of the altered <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> processing on enzymatic activity was next tested to determine if altered enzymatic activity accounts for inefficient <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> turnover .
In a fluorogenic in vitro assay , <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> activity in total cellular extracts was not significantly altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( 376  89 RFU/g total protein ) , versus wild-type cells ( 324  58 RFU/g total protein ) , although a consistent trend towards increased enzymatic activity in mutant cells was observed .
Thus , <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> transport and processing are disrupted in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells in a manner such that enzymatic activity appears to be relatively unaffected .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells show abnormal membrane organelles .
The abnormal transport and processing of <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> suggested membrane trafficking disruptions in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ; therefore , we surveyed the subcellular distribution and morphology of membrane organelles .
Components of the secretory pathway , including the ER , cis-Golgi , and trans-Golgi , did not appear altered from wild-type appearance when labeled with the respective markers , <termsem="PR:000012199"> protein disulfide isomerase </term> ( <termsem="PR:000012199"> PDI </term> ) , <termsem="PR:000008131"> GM130 </term> , and <termsem="PR:000013039"> VVL </term> ( data not shown ) .
By contrast , the lysosomal markers , Lysotracker and <termsem="PR:000002061"> Lamp 2 </term> had significantly altered signal in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , versus wild-type cells .
Wild-type cells exhibited brightly stained lysosomes that were large and clustered in the perinuclear region whereas homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 lysosomes were lightly stained , smaller vesicles that were more diffusely scattered in the cytoplasm of the cell ( Fig. 6 ) .
<termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp 1 </term> distribution was also altered , as previously noted ( Fig. 3 ) .
However , <termsem="PR:000002060"> Lamp 1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000002061"> Lamp 2 </term> total protein levels were similar in wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells by immunoblot analysis , indicating the altered signal likely reflects dispersed lysosomes or altered localization and/or epitope availability ( data not shown ) .
It is noteworthy that Lysotracker dye , which selectively accumulates in acidic compartments , exhibited the most marked reduction in lysosomal labeling .
This observation may reflect altered lysosomal pH , an established finding in JNCL [ 10,15 ] .
Lysotracker and <termsem="PR:000002061"> Lamp 2 </term> labeling of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 lysosomes Lysosomal labeling of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells with lysotracker and <termsem="PR:000002061"> Lamp 2 </term> antibody is shown .
Lysotracker dye ( top panels ) labeled large , perinuclear-clustered lysosomes and scattered lysosomes in the periphery of wild-type cells ( CbCln3 + / + ) .
Lysotracker stain was dramatically reduced in homozygous mutant cells ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) , with smaller labeled vesicles and less apparent perinuclear clustering .
<termsem="PR:000002061"> Lamp 2 </term> ( bottom panels ) immunostaining also showed reduced signal intensity with less perinuclear clustering in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , although the effect was somewhat less dramatic than that observed with Lysotracker dye .
Wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 confocal images were captured with identical exposure settings .
60  magnification .
Consistent with the altered early endosome marker ( <termsem="PR:000006901"> EEA1 </term> ) signal observed by immunostaining ( Fig. 3 ) , fluid-phase endocytosis was also altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , as measured by dextran-FITC uptake ( Fig. 7 ) .
Following a 15-minute incubation in media containing dextran-FITC , wild-type and heterozygote cells displayed brightly stained , large endocytic vesicles that were clustered in the perinuclear region .
However , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells were less brightly stained with most dextran-FITC signal localizing to smaller vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm of the cell .
Endocytosis in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells Dextran-FITC uptake in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells is shown .
In wild-type ( CbCln3 + / + , left panel ) and heterozygous ( CbCln3 + / ex7/8 , middle panel ) cells , dextran-FITC label was observed in a perinuclear-clustered vesicular pattern with scattered labeled vesicles also present in the periphery .
In contrast , dextran-FITC label of homozygous mutant ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 , right panel ) cells was reduced overall and exhibited smaller stained vesicles with less perinuclear clustering .
Confocal images were captured with identical exposure settings .

Finally , because <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> is a mitochondrial protein and its turnover proceeds through autophagic engulfment of mitochondria [ 13 ] , we analyzed homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cell mitochondrial morphology and function .
Mitochondrial distribution in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells was indistinguishable from wild-type and heterozygous cells ; however , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 mitochondria appeared more elongated by <termsem="PR:000008813"> grp75 </term> marker immunostaining and TEM analysis ( Fig. 8a ) .
72 % of homozygous mutant mitochondria were greater than 0.6 m in length ( range = 0.26 m to 2.75 m ) , while fewer wild-type mitochondria ( 51 % ) reached this length ( range = 0.15 m to 2.29 m ) .
Mitochondrial width was not altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , compared to wild-type or heterozygous cells , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells had significantly reduced cellular ATP levels ( 1.3 fold less , Fig. 8b ) and exhibited reduced survival following hydrogen peroxide treatment ( ~ 50 % of wild-type survival , Fig. 8c ) , suggesting impaired energy metabolism and oxidative stress response .
Taken together , these data support impaired mitochondrial function in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells .
Mitochondrial morphology and function in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells a. Confocal and TEM micrographs of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 mitochondrial morphology are shown .
Immunostaining with the inner mitochondrial membrane marker , <termsem="PR:000008813"> grp75 </term> ( top panels ) highlighted elongated mitochondria in homozygous mutant cells ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) , relative to wild-type mitochondria ( CbCln3 + / + ) ( insets , zoom = 2.75 x ) .
Mitochondrial distribution was not altered from the wild-type pattern .
Elongated homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 mitochondria were also observed by TEM analysis .

b. Cellular ATP levels in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells are shown .
Wild-type ( open bar ) and heterozygous ( gray bar ) CbCln3ex7/8 cells contained ~ 39 M ATP , while homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( black bar ) contained ~ 1.3 fold reduced levels of ATP ( ~ 30 M ) , which was statistically significant in a t-test ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Wild-type and heterozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cellular ATP levels were not statistically different from each other ( p > 0.4 ) .
A representative of triplicate experiments is shown ( n = 6 in each experiment ) .
c. Cell survival following 24-hour hydrogen peroxide treatment is shown .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells were ~ 2-fold more sensitive to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide treatment .
Wild-type ( circle ) and heterozygous ( triangle ) CbCln3ex7/8 cells exhibited ~ 50 % survival rates with 75 -- 100 M H2O2 , whereas homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( squares ) had a ~ 50 % survival rate with 50 M H2O2 .
A representative of triplicate experiments is shown ( n = 4 in each experiment ) .
CbCln3ex7/8 cerebellar precursor cells represent the first genetically accurate neuron-derived culture model of JNCL .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells express mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> and JNCL-hallmark <termsem="PR:000022190"> mitochondrial ATPase subunit c </term> accumulation , upon aging of cells at confluency .
Moreover , this is the first study to indicate recessive endosomal/lysosomal membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction that precedes <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> deposition in an accurate JNCL model .
Importantly , these defects are likely to be early events in the JNCL disease process and may particularly impact neuronal function .
Abnormal <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> localization and processing in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells and Cln3ex7/8 mice likely reflects altered vesicular trafficking and/or lysosomal pH , which is known to impact <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> processing [ 14,16 ] .
Indeed , <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> overexpression in HEK-293 cells altered lysosomal pH and <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> processing [ 17 ] , and lysosomal pH homeostasis is disrupted in JNCL [ 10,15 ] .
It is noteworthy that <termsem="PR:000006023"> cathepsin B </term> and the <termsem="PR:000016585"> CLN2 </term> - encoded enzyme , <termsem="PR:000016585"> TPPI </term> , are also altered in JNCL [ 18-20 ] .
Nevertheless , despite the <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> protein alterations that are observed in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> enzymatic activity does not appear to be reduced .
Thus , decreased <termsem="PR:000006025"> cathepsin D </term> activity is unlikely to account for <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> accumulation in JNCL .
Aging of homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells at confluency is necessary to induce significantly accumulated <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> protein .
However , membrane organelle disruptions precede <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> accumulation in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , since they are observed without aging at confluency .
Lysosomal and endosomal size and distribution are altered , and mitochondria are abnormally elongated and functionally compromised in sub-confluent homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cultures .
These observations argue that membrane trafficking defects do not result from excessive <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> accumulation compromising the lysosome , but rather are early events in the disease process preceding <termsem="PR:000022190"> subunit c </term> accumulation .
Mitochondrial abnormalities , which have also been reported in JNCL patients and other animal models [ 21-23 ] , may result from ineffective turnover by autophagy , a lysosomal-targeted pathway [ 24 ] .
Alternatively , or simultaneously , <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> deficiency may impact mitochondrial function upstream of turnover , affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and/or altered transport and processing of mitochondrial proteins .
In wild-type CbCln3 neuronal precursor cells <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> primarily co-localizes with early and late endosomes .
<termsem="PR:000005591"> Battenin </term> immunostaining in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 neuronal precursors is significantly reduced in abundance , but mutant signal also co-localizes with endosomal markers suggesting mutant <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> protein with C-terminal epitopes is trafficked similar to wild-type protein .
In other studies , <termsem="PR:000005591"> CLN3 </term> / <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> protein localization has been reported to partially overlap with late endosomes and lysosomes in non-neuronal cells [ 7 ] , and to lysosomes , synaptosomes [ 8 ] and endosomes [ 9,25 ] in neurons .
These data jointly indicate that <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> resides in a subset of vesicular compartments linking multiple membrane trafficking pathways , perhaps functioning in vesicular transport and/or fusion .
Endocytic and lysosomal-targeted pathways , including mitochondrial autophagy , are specifically implicated in this study .
The membrane trafficking and mitochondrial deficits uncovered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells are likely to particularly impact neuronal function .
Neurotransmission heavily relies on membrane vesicle transport , and a high-energy metabolism may further sensitize neurons to the loss of <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> activity .
Thus , our panel of wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cerebellar cells provide an ideal model system to further elucidate <termsem="PR:000005591"> battenin </term> function and JNCL pathogenesis .
