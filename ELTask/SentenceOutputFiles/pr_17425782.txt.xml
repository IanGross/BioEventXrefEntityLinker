<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> roles in Wnt signaling in mammalian kidney development .
The pygopus gene of Drosophila encodes an essential component of the <termsem="PR:000002198"> Armadillo </term> ( <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> ) transcription factor complex of canonical Wnt signaling .
To better understand the functions of Pygopus-mediated canonical Wnt signaling in kidney development , targeted mutations were made in the two mammalian orthologs , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> .
Each mutation deleted > 80 % of the coding sequence , including the critical PHD domain , and almost certainly resulted in null function .
<termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> homozygous mutants , with rare exception , died shortly after birth , with a phenotype including lens agenesis , growth retardation , altered kidney development , and in some cases exencephaly and cleft palate .
<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> homozygous mutants , however , were viable and fertile , with no detectable developmental defects .
Double <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> homozygous mutants showed no apparent synergy in phenotype severity .
The BAT-gal transgene reporter of canonical Wnt signaling showed reduced levels of expression in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - mutants , with tissue-specific variation in degree of diminution .
The <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes both showed widespread expression in the developing kidney , with raised levels in the stromal cell compartment .
Confocal analysis of the double mutant kidneys showed disturbance of both the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme-derived compartments .
Branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud was altered , with expanded tips and reduced tip density , probably contributing to the smaller size of the mutant kidney .
In addition , there was an expansion of the zone of condensed mesenchyme capping the ureteric bud .
Nephron formation , however , proceeded normally .
Microarray analysis showed changed expression of several genes , including <termsem="PR:000006067"> Cxcl13 </term> , <termsem="PR:000015169"> Slc5a2 </term> , <termsem="PR:000009415"> Klk5 </term> , <termsem="PR:000014395"> Ren2 </term> and <termsem="PR:000016340"> Timeless </term> , which represent candidate Wnt targets in kidney development .
The mammalian Pygopus genes are required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud during kidney development .
Nevertheless , the relatively mild phenotype observed in the kidney , as well as other organ systems , indicates a striking evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between mammals and Drosophila .
In mammals , the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes are not absolutely required for canonical Wnt signaling in most developing systems , but rather function as quantitative transducers , or modulators , of Wnt signal intensity .
Wnt signaling is of critical importance in several stages of kidney development .
Mutual inductive interactions between the ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme drive nephrogenesis [ 1 ] .
The ureteric bud synthesizes <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> , which is essential for induction of the mesenchyme to form nephrons [ 2 ] .
<termsem="PR:000017444"> Wnt4 </term> is made by the induced metanephric mesenchyme and is also required for nephrogenesis [ 3 ] .
Furthermore , <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> , secreted by the ureteric bud tips , participates in a positive feedback loop promoting <termsem="PR:000007928"> glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor </term> ( <termsem="PR:000007928"> GDNF </term> ) expression by the metanephric mesenchyme [ 4 ] .
Mutations in <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> or <termsem="PR:000017444"> Wnt4 </term> result in a dramatic block in nephron formation , while <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> mutants show a significant reduction in nephron number .
It is interesting to note that <termsem="PR:000017444"> Wnt4 </term> and <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> have been shown to signal , at least in some cases , through noncanonical pathways [ 5-7 ] , while there is evidence indicating that <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> activates canonical Wnt signaling in the kidney [ 2 ] .
Genetic studies in Drosophila have identified the Pygopus ( Pygo ) gene as a critical component of canonical Wnt signaling [ 8-11 ] .
Pygo and <termsem="PR:000004704"> Lgs </term> interact with <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> during the formation of the canonical transcriptional complex and are required for accumulation of <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> in the nucleus [ 12 ] .
<termsem="PR:000004704"> Lgs </term> binds the central armadillo repeats of <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> , while Pygo interacts with <termsem="PR:000004704"> Lgs </term> , mediating activation of Wnt targets [ 9,13 ] .
The N-terminal domain of Pygo is required for Wnt transcriptional activation , while the PHD motif is required for the association of Pygo with <termsem="PR:000004704"> Lgs </term> [ 9,13 ] .
Additionally , a putative nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) was identified within the N-terminal domain of Pygo , suggesting a possible role of nuclear importation of <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> [ 8,11 ] .
Analyses of multiple aspects of the pygopus mutant phenotype indicate that this gene is dedicated to , and required for , canonical Wnt signaling during Drosophila development [ 9 ] .
The mammalian genome carries two , and only two , orthologs of Drosophila Pygo , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> [ 8,9,14 ] .
In this report , we generated targeted mutations of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> to determine their functions , with a particular interest in the contributions of these genes to canonical Wnt signaling during kidney development .
The resulting double-homozygous mutant embryos showed a context-dependent reduction in canonical Wnt signaling as measured by Wnt reporter transgene expression .
Development remained , however , surprisingly normal , with survival to birth and few apparent defects in most organ systems .
Our phenotypic analysis focused on the kidney , which showed altered branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud , and expansion of the zone of condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud , yet relatively normal nephron formation , as measured by histology , confocal analysis , in situ hybridization and microarray analysis .
The obvious conclusion is that in mammals , unlike Drosophila , Pygopus-mediated canonical Wnt signaling is not absolutely necessary in most developing organ systems .
<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> targeted mutations .
We targeted both the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes by inserting LoxP sequences to flank critical coding regions including the PHD domains .
The resulting targeted mice were mated with transgenic CMV-Cre mice [ 15 ] to drive germline LoxP recombination , resulting in the null mutant alleles that were used for this study .
PCR confirmed the deletion of the bulk of the coding sequences for both genes , including 89 % of coding sequence for <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and 87 % of coding sequence for <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> .
Previous studies in Drosophila have shown that even a single missense mutation in the PHD domain can eliminate Pygo function in Wnt signaling [ 8 ] .
<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant phenotypes .
<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> homozygous null mice were viable and fertile with no developmental defects detectable .
This was surprising given the importance of the pygopus gene in Wnt signaling in Drosophila , and the reported expression during development of the mouse <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> gene in , for example , the brain , limbs , kidney and branchial arches [ 14,16 ] ( Yu J , Valerius MT , McMahon AP , contribution to GUDMAP , ) .
The <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> homozygous null mice survived to birth , but with rare exceptions , died shortly afterwards .
The gut , heart and limbs developed without detectable abnormality ( data not shown ) despite known requirements for Wnt signaling .
The <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutants did , however , show growth retardation , lens agenesis and a kidney phenotype with high penetrance , exencephaly , and cleft palate with incomplete penetrance .
Double-homozygous mutant <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mice had a phenotype similar to that of single <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> nulls ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) .
There was no significant synergism of developmental abnormalities in the double mutants .
Together these results suggest that <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> is required for the proper development of a limited number of structures , whereas <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> is not necessary for normal development .

Expression of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> in the developing kidney .
In situ hybridization has been used previously to characterize expression of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> [ 14,16 ] ( Yu J , Valerius MT , McMahon AP , contribution to GUDMAP , ) .
In this report , we used immunofluorescence to better define the expression patterns of the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes in the developing kidney .
Both genes were widely expressed , showing nuclear localization of encoded proteins in the ureteric bud , capping mesenchyme , and stromal cells ( Figure 2 ) .
Raised expression of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> , and to a lesser degree of <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> , was seen in stromal cells , and significant nuclear staining was detected in essentially all cells of the developing kidney for both proteins .

Immunofluorescence was used to determine expression patterns of the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> proteins in the cortex of the E18 .5 kidney .
Both <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> ( red ) were localized in the nucleus , as expected .
Both genes showed widespread expression , with signal detected in all components of the developing kidney , but with elevated levels in the stromal cell compartment ( arrows ) .
Epithelial cells , primarily ureteric bud in these sections , were labeled blue using <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> antibody .

Confocal analysis was therefore performed to characterize renal development in E18 .5 <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidneys more precisely ( Figure 3 ) .

Antibodies to <termsem="PR:000001447"> Cdh1 </term> , also known as <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> ( blue ) , were used to identify epithelial structures , including the branching ureteric bud and nascent nephrons of the developing kidney [ 18 ] .
Dolichos biflorus ( DBA ) lectin [ 16 ] was used to selectively stain ureteric bud-derived structures [ 19 ] .

Confocal Z-sections were obtained every 5 m for 75 -- 80 m .
A reduced number of ureteric tips per area was observed in ( B , D ) the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidneys compared with ( A , C ) control littermates .
In addition , ureteric bud tips were often more dilated in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / 2 null mutants compared with controls .
The condensed mesenchyme surrounding the ureteric bud was also significantly expanded in the mutants .

<termsem="PR:000017459"> Wt1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000005505"> Cited1 </term> ( red ) staining revealed an increase of approximately 30 % in the thickness of the capping mesenchyme surrounding the mutant ureteric buds ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ) .
Nevertheless , the mutant metanephric mesenchyme underwent relatively normal nephrogenesis .
<termsem="PR:000001447"> Cdh1 </term> - staining nephrons ( blue ) were identified connecting to the ureteric bud tips [ 16 ] and extending into the medulla of the kidney , as normal .

Confocal analysis also showed that the ureteric bud tips [ 16 ] of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidneys were dilated and misshaped compared with those of littermates with at least one wild-type <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> allele ( Figure 3 ) .
In addition , the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> double-homozygous mutant kidneys also had a decrease of approximately 25 % in the number of ureteric bud tips per area compared with littermates with at least one wild-type copy of <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> ( Table 2 ) .
No significant difference in ureteric bud-tip density was seen between <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + embryos ( P = 0.33 ) .
We examined expression of three Wnt genes in Pygo mutants .
<termsem="PR:000017449"> Wnt7b </term> is expressed in the stalks [ 20 ] , <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> in the tips [ 4 ] , and <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> in the stalks and weakly in the tips of the branching ureteric bud [ 2 ] .
All three genes showed similar expression patterns in <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> double-mutant kidneys ( Figure 4 ) .
In addition , these in situ hybridization patterns confirmed the confocal microscopy results , showing a reduced number of tips ( <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> - positive ) per surface area in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> double-homozygous mutants .

Reduced canonical Wnt signaling in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant mice .
The BAT-gal transgene reporter of canonical Wnt signaling [ 21 ] was used to examine changes in Wnt signaling in the mutant mice .
Both <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> double-null E10 .5 embryos showed a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling ( Figure 5 ) .
There was , however , tissue-specific variability in the degree of reduction , with the somites , for example , showing strong reduction , while the mutant telencephalon still showed robust Wnt signaling .
These results suggest that the mammalian Pygo genes are significant modulators of canonical Wnt signaling in some , but not in all developing systems .

We also examined BAT-gal reporter expression in more detail in the developing urogenital system of Pygo mutants .
The results suggested that the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene is required for canonical Wnt signaling in the nephric duct .

At E13 .5 , the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene appeared to play a major role , and the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> gene a minor role , in canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric tree , as measured by BAT-gal expression .
A negative control kidney , without the BAT-gal transgene , showed minimal background X-gal staining ( Figure 6D ) , whereas a BAT-gal transgenic kidney with at least one wild-type <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene showed strong X-gal staining in the ureteric tree ( Figure 6E ) .
In contrast , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - E13 .5 kidneys showed very weak reporter expression ( Figure 6F ) , suggesting a significant loss of canonical Wnt signaling .
Homozygous loss of the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> gene alone , however , had a small effect on reporter expression ( Figure 6G -- H ) .
Homozygous mutation of both the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes gave a more dramatic reduction of BAT-gal expression than loss of <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> alone ( Figure 6F , L ) .
The <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes were also required for BAT-gal reporter expression in the paramesonephric ( Mullerian ) ducts .
In <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - mice , there was a significant loss of reporter expression ( data not shown ) , and double-homozygous mutants showed loss of X-gal staining in the paramesonephric ducts ( Figure 6K ) , whereas <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - mice showed normal levels of BAT-gal expression ( Figure 6G , H , J ) .
BAT-gal reporter analysis of the Pygo mutants at a later developmental stage , E18 .5 , also identified a significant decrease in canonical Wnt signaling in the cortical ureteric branches and renal pelvis of the developing kidney ( Figure 6M -- O ) .
Cortical X-gal staining was seen in the ureteric branches of a <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - kidney ( Figure 6M , left ) , but was completely absent in the cortex of a <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - kidney ( Figure 6M , right ) .
Bisection revealed a significant loss of X-gal staining cells in the collecting ducts and renal pelvis of the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidney compared with control littermates ( Figure 6N ) .
Side by side comparison of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / + / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - ( Figure 6O , left ) , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - ( Figure 6O , middle ) , and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - ( Figure 6O , right ) E18 .5 kidneys suggested a significant role for the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene in canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric tree and its derivatives .
In order to validate and quantify the BAT-gal reporter expression changes in the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> nulls , we performed ELISA measurements of transgene specific -galactosidase levels in E18 .5 kidneys ( Figure 7 ) .
Loss of the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene ( <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - ) gave greater than 90 % reduction in BAT-gal expression .
Loss of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> alone ( <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + ) did not result in a significant change .
Interestingly , however , the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - showed only 50 % of wild-type BAT-gal expression , suggesting a minor contribution by <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> in canonical Wnt signaling .
Although BAT-gal expression was decreased in the E18 .5 <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - kidney , confocal analysis of kidneys with this genotype revealed no dilated ureteric tips or significant changes in ureteric tip number per area compared with <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + kidneys ( data not shown ) .
Collectively , these BAT-gal reporter results suggest a significant role for the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes in canonical Wnt signaling during development of the ureteric tree of the kidney .
Quantitative analysis of BAT-gal reporter expression in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> E18 .5 kidney extracts .
Transgene-specific beta-galactosidase was quantified by ELISA analysis .
<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + kidneys all showed similar levels of BAT-gal expression .
In the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> hetereozygote , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> homozygous mutants , however , reporter expression was reduced by about 50 % .
In <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> homozygous mutants BAT-gal expression was uniformly low , with or without wild-type <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> alleles .
Each experimental group included a sample size of at least four .
Interestingly , however , even in wild-type mice the BAT-gal reporter showed no expression in the developing metanephric mesenchyme , or metanephric mesenchyme-derived structures , such as renal vesicles , S-shaped bodies , tubules , and glomeruli .
This has been reported previously , and was interpreted to indicate the absence of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme [ 21 ] .
Results from other studies , however , argue for the presence of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme .
For example , ureteric bud expression of <termsem="PR:000017435"> Wnt1 </term> , thought to act through canonical Wnt signaling , can rescue <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> mutants and induce nephrogenesis of the metanephric mesenchyme [ 2 ] .
This suggests that the BAT-gal transgene might not accurately report canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme .
To address this question , we incubated E11 .5 metanephric mesenchyme in lithium chloride ( LiCl ) , which activates canonical Wnt signaling through inhibition of GSK3 , and also functions as an inducer of nephrogenesis in kidney organ culture [ 22 ] .
We observed that LiCl-treated metanephric mesenchyme did undergo nephrogenesis , as expected , but failed to show BAT-gal expression ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this transgene is not an accurate reporter of canonical Wnt signaling in the metanephric mesenchyme of the developing kidney .
Microarray analysis of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidneys .
To further examine possible disturbance of gene expression in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant kidneys , we used microarrays to perform a global analysis of gene expression changes .
Whereas the BAT-gal transgene reporter monitors the response of one promoter to Wnt signaling , microarrays can be used to follow expression changes of all genes , including all known Wnt targets .
E18 .5 wild-type and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - kidneys were examined in biological triplicate .
In total , 45 genes were identified as significantly changed , using a relatively low stringency screen of the data , with a p-value cutoff of < 0.05 , and fold change > 2 ( Table 3 ) .
Notably , both <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> were identified as downregulated ( - 5.3-fold and - 3.9-fold , respectively ) in the mutant kidneys .
Other genes with significant decreases in mutant kidneys included <termsem="PR:000006067"> Cxcl13 </term> ( - 2.3-fold ) , <termsem="PR:000015169"> Slc5a2 </term> ( - 2.8-fold ) , and <termsem="PR:000015966"> Slco1a4 </term> ( - 2.1-fold ) .
<termsem="PR:000015169"> Slc5a2 </term> is expressed in the proximal tubules of the adult nephron and has been implicated in autosomal recessive renal glucosuria , characterized by loss of glucose uptake by the nephron [ 23 ] .
The organic anion transporter , <termsem="PR:000015966"> Slco1a4 </term> , is also strongly expressed in the tubules of the adult kidney [ 24 ] .
These results suggest that the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes might play a role in nephron maturation and subsequent function .
Genes differentially expressed ( p < 0.05 , two-fold change or greater ) in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null E18 .5 kidney normalized to wild-type samples .
Noteworthy genes upregulated in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidney included <termsem="PR:000009415"> Klk5 </term> ( 2.8-fold ) , <termsem="PR:000009416"> Klk6 </term> ( 2.7-fold ) , <termsem="PR:000014395"> Ren2 </term> ( 2.2-fold ) , and <termsem="PR:000016340"> Timeless </term> ( 2.4-fold ) .
<termsem="PR:000009415"> Klk5 </term> and <termsem="PR:000009416"> Klk6 </term> are members of the kallikrein family of trypsin-like serine proteases .
Kallikreins have diverse functions in cancer , tissue remodeling , and regulation of blood pressure [ 25 ] .
<termsem="PR:000014395"> Ren2 </term> , a homolog of the endopeptidase <termsem="PR:000014394"> Renin 1 </term> , activates the renin-angiotensin system , increasing blood pressure [ 26 ] .
Disruption of the renin-angiotensin system during development results in congenital abnormalities of the ureter and collecting-duct system [ 27 ] .
<termsem="PR:000016340"> Timeless </term> , a transcription factor involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms , and expressed in the branching ureteric tips , has also been shown to regulate ureteric branching morphogenesis [ 28 ] .
We were interested in the possible altered expression of previously known Wnt targets in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - mutant kidneys .
A list of known Wnt targets was compiled from .
Both <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> probe sets were included as references to illustrate significant down regulation .
Remarkably , the known Wnt target genes showed very few differences in expression between wild-type and mutant kidneys ( Figure 8 ) .
Only the expression of <termsem="PR:000005121"> Ccnd1 </term> encoding <termsem="PR:000005121"> cyclin D1 </term> [ 29 ] , and <termsem="PR:000017426"> Wisp1 </term> [ 30 ] were significantly changed , with expression level changes of < 1.5-fold in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidneys .
These results indicate an absence of dramatic changes in expression of previously known Wnt signaling target genes in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant kidneys .
Gene expression changes of common Wnt signaling targets in the E18 .5 <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidney .
Microarray analysis was performed in triplicate on wild-type and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / 2 compound null E18 .5 kidneys .
Possible Wnt targets were selected from those compiled at [ 39 ] .
An initial gene list of 82 Wnt targets was created and then reduced to a total of 40 genes using an expression level restriction requiring the raw expression intensity to be > 100 in at least 3 samples .
<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> probes were included to demonstrate significant changes in expression levels .
We used quantitative real-time PCR , with independent biological samples , to validate the microarray results .
Nine genes were tested , and for seven we did observe a significant fold change in the same direction predicted by the microarray results ( Table 4 ) .
It is not surprising that two of the nine genes could not be validated , considering the relatively low stringency used in screening the microarray data .
Validation of gene expression changes in the E18 .5 <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null kidneys normalized to E18 .5 wild-type kidneys .
In Drosophila , the Pygopus gene is a key mediator of canonical Wnt signaling .
In one study , 12 distinct measures of Wnt signaling in Pygo mutants were performed , including analysis of leg , wing , and eye imaginal discs .
In 2 cases there was a significant reduction of Wnt signaling and in 10 cases a complete block [ 10 ] .
A second study in Drosophila examined the effects of Pygo mutation on cuticle patterning , midgut constriction , central nervous system , and cardiac development , and concluded that `` Pygo is an essential component in the <termsem="PR:000017435"> Wg </term> signal transduction pathway '' .
[ 8 ] .
Given these results in Drosophila , the relatively mild phenotypes of mice with targeted <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> , <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> , or double <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutations were striking .
<termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutants developed to birth and showed limited abnormalities , while <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> homozygous mutants were normal and fertile .
Furthermore , there was no detected synergism in the phenotype of the double <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant , although in several tissues the BAT-gal Wnt reporter did show more a severe reduction in expression .
One possible explanation of these unexpected results is a failure of the gene targeting to eliminate functioning of the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes .
The Pygopus deletion alleles described in this report , however , are almost certainly functional nulls .
In Drosophila , it has been shown that the PHD domain is absolutely necessary for Pygopus function in <termsem="PR:000017435"> Wg </term> signaling .
The PHD domain is 60 amino acids with seven cysteines and a histidine , predicted to chelate two zinc ions .
PHD domains are found in diverse proteins , including transcription factors , and have been implicated in chromatin remodeling and protein-protein interactions [ 8 ] .
In Drosophila the pygoF107 allele , with a single missense mutation converting amino acid 802 in the PHD domain from cysteine to tyrosine , loses Wnt signaling function in both embryogenesis and imaginal disc development [ 8 ] .
The <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant alleles made in this report carried deletions of the entire PHD domains , as well as most other coding sequences .
For the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> gene , the coding region for 372 of 417 total amino acids was deleted , and for the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene , we deleted coding for 354 of 405 amino acids .
It is therefore very unlikely that the relatively mild phenotypes observed were the result of residual function of the targeted alleles .
We focused our analysis on the developing kidney , in which Wnt signaling has been shown to be of critical importance in several stages of nephrogenesis .
<termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> is made by the ureteric bud and induces the metanephric mesenchyme to undergo nephrogenesis [ 2 ] .
Downstream of <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> is <termsem="PR:000017444"> Wnt4 </term> [ 2 ] , which is made by the metanephric mesenchyme , and is also required for nephrogenesis [ 3 ] .
In addition , <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> is produced by the ureteric bud tips and induces <termsem="PR:000007928"> GDNF </term> expression in the metanephric mesenchyme [ 4 ] .
In this report we describe a novel Wnt function in kidney development .
The BAT-gal transgene reporter indicated the presence of canonical Wnt signaling in the ureteric bud and its derivatives in the developing kidney .
Further , in the <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutants this signal was lost , suggesting significant reduction of Wnt signaling .
In addition , we observed a resulting decrease in ureteric tip density , reduced kidney size and altered morphology of the ureteric tree in mutants , indicating a role for canonical Wnt signaling in branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud .
While the simplest interpretation is direct Wnt signaling to the ureteric bud , it remains possible that the observed abnormalities are the result of indirect effects , with altered Wnt signaling to the metanephric mesenchyme then affecting mesenchyme to ureteric bud signaling .
The <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant phenotype of reduced branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud is surprisingly similar to that previously reported for <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> mutants [ 4 ] .
The underlying mechanisms , however , are likely to be distinct .
<termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> is generally thought to act through a noncanonical pathway , ( although exceptions have been noted [ 31 ] ) , whereas the Pygopus genes promote canonical Wnt signaling .
Further , the <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> mutants showed an altered feedback loop between Wnt signaling from the ureteric bud to the mesenchyme and <termsem="PR:000007928"> GDNF </term> signaling from the mesenchyme to the bud , whereas in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutants , we observed disrupted Wnt signaling in the ureteric bud .
The <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / 2 mutants also showed an expansion of the zone of thickened mesenchyme that caps the ureteric bud .
Nevertheless , the mutant metanephric mesenchyme formed nephrons normally .
This was particularly interesting , as <termsem="PR:000017453"> Wnt9b </term> signaling from the ureteric bud to the metanephric mesenchyme has been shown to induce nephrogenesis via canonical Wnt signaling [ 2 ] .
The results in this report indicate a striking and surprising evolutionary divergence of Pygopus function between Drosophila and mammals .
In Drosophila , the Pygopus gene is often required for canonical Wnt signaling , while in mammals the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes appear to play a smaller role in canonical Wnt signaling .
The BAT-gal transgene reporter of canonical Wnt signaling showed reduced but generally not absent signal in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutant embryos , with tissue-specific variation in level of diminution .
In addition , the kidneys were not unique in showing surprisingly normal development in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutants .
Indeed , organogenesis generally proceeded without detectable abnormality , with few exceptions .
These results suggest that the proteins encoded by mammalian Pygopus genes are often mere modulators of canonical Wnt signaling intensity , and not essential components .
The microarray results further support this conclusion .
Whereas the BAT-gal transgene reporter monitors the expression level of only one Wnt responsive promoter , the microarray allows the analysis of the activity levels of promoters of all genes .
Interestingly , the mutant kidneys showed gene-expression profiles surprisingly similar to wild type .
Some genes did , however , show expression differences , and a high percentage of these differences could be validated by real-time PCR with independent biological samples .
Assuming that the Pygopus genes in mammals are dedicated to canonical Wnt signaling , as has been previously shown in Drosophila , the genes with expression differences represent candidate Wnt targets ( direct or indirect ) in kidney development .
We would predict these genes to show greater changes in expression level in a developing kidney with a more complete removal of canonical Wnt signaling .
In conclusion , the mammalian <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> gene is required for normal branching morphogenesis of the ureteric bud , with mutants showing dilated tips and reduced numbers of tips .
In addition , in <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> mutants there was an expansion of the zone of metanephric mesenchyme that caps the ureteric buds .
Nevertheless , nephron formation proceeded remarkably normally , even in <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> double-homozygous mutants .
This was surprising considering the importance of the Pygopus gene in canonical Wnt signaling in Drosophila , and the importance of canonical Wnt signaling in nephrogenesis .
The results argue that the mammalian Pygopus genes are , in most developing systems , only quantitative transducers of Wnt signaling .
Previous cell culture studies [ 32,33 ] and the reduced BAT-gal transgene reporter expression in the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> knockout mice described in this report , do confirm an evolutionarily conserved function in canonical Wnt signaling .
In mammals , however , the phenotypic effects of Pygopus mutation are much milder than in Drosophila .
The degree of importance of the <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pyg1 </term> / 2 genes in Wnt signaling was context-dependent , but in general , mammalian organogenesis remained intact in Pygopus mutants .
Perhaps the simplest explanation is that in mammals , other genes show partial functional redundancy with the two Pygopus genes .
The <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> transcription-factor complex includes a large and growing number of proteins , some of which may share the nuclear localization and/or transcription activation functions of <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> in mammals .
The identities and roles of these Pygopus redundant genes remain to be determined .

<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> genes were each targeted by flanking the critical coding regions of the third exon containing the PHD motif with LoxP sequences .
Targeting constructs were made using the Flp/Cre vector previously described [ 34 ] , which carries a neomycin-resistance gene flanked by FRT sequences , and three unique restriction sites for subcloning the two blocks of homology for driving recombination , and the critical region to be flanked by LoxP sequences .
For each construct , the three genomic segments required for subcloning were made by PCR from RI ES cell DNA .
The resulting targeting constructs were confirmed by sequencing .
For <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> , the genomic sequences used for PCR were : 5 ' forward , GTGAAGGAGAGATGGATAAGTATG ; 5 ' back , TAGACCCTAACCACCTACAAG ; exon forward , GGTTAGGGTCTATGTGCTGG ; exon back , TCACCAAATCTCTGTTCTACAC ; 3 ' forward , TGTGTAGAACAGAGATTTGGTG ; 3 ' back , CAGTGAAGAAAGAGGGTCAG .
For <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> , the genomic sequences used for PCR were : GCCTGGGTTGCTTGTCTTCTG and CCACCTTACTTGTGTGTGAGGATACATAC , CCAAGTCCCAGCATCTCTTAC and CCAGTCATACCAGCAACAAG , and exon sequences TGGGTGCTGGGAACAGAAC and CAACAACAACAGAAGACAAGC .
Linearized constructs were electroporated into RI ES cells , and resulting targeted ES cells used for C57/Bl6 blastocyst injections according to standard protocols .
Resulting chimeras were mated with Swiss Black mice , and the targeted stocks maintained on a mixed 129/Swiss Black background .
Germline null alleles of both <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> were generated by mating heterozygous floxed mice with the CMV-Cre mice [ 15 ] .
The sequences of the primers used for genotyping PCR were : <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> null allele , forward ( F ) CCTGGATTCTTGTTGCTGGTATG ; reverse ( R ) AAGGTATTTGGTGCTCCGAGGG ; <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> WT or floxed allele , F TGTCTTGATGACAGCGTTTAGCC , R AGATTCAGTAAGCTGAGCCTGGTG ; <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> null allele , F AGTTTGAAATAGCGACGAGTTTGAG , R 5 ' - CACTTCTGCCCCTCTCTTTGC ; <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> WT or floxed allele , F AAGCGTGCCTCATCTCCATCCCTAAG , R GCCCTCCCCGACGTTTATATTG .
The noon of the day that vaginal plugs were observed was designated E0 .5 .
Kidneys were dissected , fixed in paraformaldehyde , treated with methanol , and washed with PBS containing Tween-20 ( PBS-T ) prior to treatment with lectins and antibodies .
PBS-T was used for incubations of the tissues with fluoroscein-conjugated Dilichos biflorus aggutinin ( DBA , Vector ; Burlingame , USA ) , and PBS-T plus 2 % goat serum was used for incubations with the antibodies .
The primary antibodies were anti- <termsem="PR:000017459"> WT1 </term> ( c-19 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , anti- <termsem="PR:000001447"> uvomorulin </term> ( <termsem="PR:000001447"> e-cadherin </term> , <termsem="PR:000001447"> Cdh1 </term> , Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis , MO , USA ) , and anti- <termsem="PR:000005505"> Cited1 </term> ( Neomarkers-Lab Vision Corporation , Fremont , CA , USA ) .
The secondary antibodies were Alexa 555-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa 633-conjugated anti-rat antibodies ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) .
The tissues were imaged with a laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , New York , USA ) equipped with an argon ( 488 nm ) and two HeNe lasers ( 543 nm and 633 nm ) .
Optical sections approximately 2 m thick were obtained every 5 m to a depth of at least 65 m .
The sections began at the surface of the kidney and were on a plane tangential to it .
Two Z-stack series were obtained , one from each of the two kidneys of each embryo .
Ureteric bud tips identified by section tracing were counted within a defined area of the confocal image .
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed as previously described [ 35 ] .
Riboprobes to <termsem="PR:000017438"> Wnt11 </term> and <termsem="PR:000017449"> Wnt7b </term> were described previously [ 35 ] .

<termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> antibody production .
To generate anti-human <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> ( anti-hPygo2 ) and anti-mouse <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> ( anti-mPygo1 ) polyclonal antibodies , we subcloned cDNA by PCR corresponding to amino-acid residues 80 -- 327 of human <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo 2 </term> or amino-acid residues 76 -- 263 of mouse <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> into pGEX4T1 ( Amersham Health , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) .
The PCR fragments of hPygo 2 and mPygo 1 lack both NHD and PHD conserved regions of hPygo2 and mPygo1 .
<termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> - hPygo2 and <termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> - mPygo1 proteins were expressed in bacteria , purified , and injected into rabbits for antibody production by ( Proteintech Group Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
The rabbit antisera of anti-mPygo1 and anti-hPygo2 were initially allowed to bind to the <termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> affinity matrix to remove any antibodies against <termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> .
The anti-hPygo2 and anti-mPygo1 antisera were then separated from the <termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> affinity matrix and allowed to bind to the <termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> - hPygo2 or <termsem="PR:000022850"> GST </term> - mPygo1 affinity columns , respectively .
The bound antibodes were eluted with elution buffer .
To further ensure antibody specficity , the purified antibodies were extensively incubated with <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / 2 double-homozygous mutant embryo extract before use .
BAT-gal transgene reporter assay of canonical Wnt signaling .
X-gal staining of both embryos and developing kidneys was performed as previously described [ 21 ] .
Care was taken to reduce endogenous -galactosidase activity within the developing kidney by increasing pH of the X-gal staining solution to 8.0 .
Changes in transgene -Gal expression were quantitated using a -Gal ELISA ( Enzyme-linked immunoassay ) kit ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) , normalizing according to total protein .
Each genotype was represented by a sample size of 4 except the non-transgenic ( n = 5 ) , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> + / - ; <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / + ( n = 6 ) , <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - ; <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> + / - ( n = 8 ) , and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> - / - ; <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> - / - ( n = 6 ) groups .
Total RNA was isolated from E18 .5 kidneys dissected from normal and <termsem="PR:000013523"> Pygo1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000013524"> Pygo2 </term> compound null embryos using a commercial kit ( Stratagene Absolutely RNA Microprep Kit ; La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
An aliquot ( 300 ng ) of total RNA was processed and labeled using a commercial kit ( TargetAmp 1-Round Aminoallyl-aRNA Ki ; Epicentre , Madison , WI , USA ) .
