<termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Receptor </term> </term> Signaling </term> Is Required for Postnatal Maintenance of Articular Cartilage .
Articular cartilage plays an essential role in health and <termsem="GO:0050879"> mobility </term> , but is frequently damaged or lost in millions of people that develop arthritis .
The molecular mechanisms that <termsem="GO:0032502"> create </term> and maintain this thin layer of cartilage that covers the surface of bones in joint regions are poorly understood , in part because tools to manipulate <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> specifically in this tissue have not been available .
Here we use <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> information from the mouse Gdf5 gene ( a bone <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> protein [ BMP ] family member ) to <termsem="GO:0000003"> develop </term> new mouse lines that can be used to either activate or inactivate genes specifically in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> from Gdf5 bacterial artificial chromosome clones leads to specific activation or inactivation of floxed target genes in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints , including early joint interzones , adult articular cartilage , and the joint capsule .
We have used this system to test the role of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> signaling </term> in joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Mice with null mutations in Bmpr1a are known to <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> early in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> with multiple defects .
However , combining a floxed Bmpr1a allele with the Gdf5-Cre driver bypasses this embryonic lethality , and leads to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and postnatal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of mice missing the Bmpr1a gene in articular regions .
Most joints in the body <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> normally in the absence of Bmpr1a <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> function .
However , articular cartilage within the joints gradually wears away in <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> - deficient mice after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> in a process resembling human osteoarthritis .
Gdf5-Cre mice provide a general system that can be used to test the role of genes in articular regions .
<termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> signaling </term> is required not only for early <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and creation of multiple tissues , but also for ongoing maintenance of articular cartilage after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Genetic variation in the strength of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> signaling </term> may be an important risk factor in human osteoarthritis , and treatments that mimic or <termsem="GO:0048518"> augment </term> <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> signaling </term> should be investigated as a possible therapeutic strategy for maintaining the health of joint linings .
Thin layers of articular cartilage line the bones of synovial joints and provide a smooth , wear-resistant structure that reduces friction and absorbs impact forces ( Brandt et al. 1998 ) .
Loss or damage to articular cartilage is a hallmark of arthritic diseases and is one of the most common reasons that both young and old adults seek medical care .
Millions of people are afflicted with arthritis , and it ultimately affects more than half of people over the age of 65 ( Badley 1995 ; Yelin and Callahan 1995 ) .
A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that <termsem="GO:0032502"> create </term> and maintain articular cartilage is crucial for discovering the causes of joint disorders and providing useful medical treatments .
Joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> begins during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , when stripes of high cell density called interzones <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> across <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skeletal precursors ( Haines 1947 ) .
<termsem="GO:0012501"> Programmed cell death </term> occurs within the interzone , and a three-layered interzone <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> that has two layers of higher cell density flanking a region of lower cell density .
Non-joint precursors of the skeleton typically <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> into cartilage , which hypertrophies and is replaced by bone .
However , cells within the high-density layers of the interzone are excluded from this process and <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> into the permanent layers of articular cartilage found in the mature joint ( Mitrovic 1978 ) .
Studies over the last 10 y have begun to elucidate some of the <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> that contribute to the early stages of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
Wnt14 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in stripes at the sites where joints will <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> , and it is capable of inducing <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of other joint markers when misexpressed at new locations in the limb ( Hartmann and Tabin 2001 ) .
Several members of the bone <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> protein ( BMP ) family of <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules are also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in stripes at sites where joints will <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> , including those encoded by the genes Gdf5 , Gdf6 , Gdf7 , Bmp2 , and Bmp4 ( Storm and Kingsley 1996 ; Wolfman et al. 1997 ; Francis-West et al. 1999 ; Settle et al. 2003 ) .
Of these , Gdf5 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is most strikingly limited to regions where joints will <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> and is one of the earliest known markers of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
Mutations in either Gdf5 or the closely related Gdf6 gene also block <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of joints at specific locations , providing strong evidence that these molecules are essential for the joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation process </term> ( Storm et al. 1994 ; Settle et al. 2003 ) .
However , mutations in Bmp2 or Bmp4 cause early embryonic lethality , making it difficult to test their role in joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> ( Winnier et al. 1995 ; Zhang and Bradley 1996 ) .
Much less is known about how <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> function during the subsequent <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and maintenance of adult joint structures .
Importantly , <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> components are present in adult articular cartilage , suggesting that they may function during the late <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> or maintenance of this critical structure ( Erlacher et al. 1998 ; Chubinskaya et al. 2000 ; Muehleman et al. 2002 ; Bau et al. 2002 ; Bobacz et al. 2003 ) .
BMPs <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> tetrameric complexes of two type I and two type II <termsem="GO:0004675"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transmembrane <termsem="GO:0004674"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> serine-threonine kinase </term> </term> receptors </term> </term> .
Upon BMP <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> , these complexes <termsem="GO:0007165"> transduce </term> a signal by <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylating </term> members of the Smad family of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> ( Massague 1996 ) .
Recent experiments have implicated two different BMP type I <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> in skeletal <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> , BMPR1A and BMPR1B .
Both <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> can <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> BMP2 , BMP4 , and GDF5 , although GDF5 shows higher affinity for BMPR1B ( Koenig et al. 1994 ; ten Dijke et al. 1994 ; Yamaji et al. 1994 ; Nishitoh et al. 1996 ; Chalaux et al. 1998 ) .
Both <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> are also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in dynamic patterns during normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
In limbs , Bmpr1a <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> becomes restricted to joint interzones , perichondrium , periarticular cartilage , hypertrophic chondrocytes , and interdigital limb mesenchyme .
In comparison , Bmpr1b <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is seen primarily in condensing precartilaginous mesenchymal cells , regions flanking joint interzones , perichondrium , and periarticular cartilage ( Dewulf et al. 1995 ; Mishina et al. 1995 ; Zou et al. 1997 ; Baur et al. 2000 ) .
Null mutations in the Bmpr1b gene <termsem="GO:0000003"> produce </term> viable mice with defects in bone and joint formation that closely resemble those seen in mice missing Gdf5 ( Storm and Kingsley 1996 ; Baur et al. 2000 ; Yi et al. 2000 ) .
Null mutations in Bmpr1a cause early embryonic lethality , with defects in <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> similar to those seen in mice with mutations in Bmp4 ( Mishina et al. 1995 ; Winnier et al. 1995 ) .
Recent studies with floxed alleles suggest that Bmpr1a is also required for many later <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental events </term> , but its roles in bone and joint formation have not yet been tested ( Mishina 2003 ) .
A genetic system for activating or inactivating genes specifically in joint tissues would be particularly useful for further studies of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and maintenance .
Here we take advantage of the tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern of the Gdf5 gene to <termsem="GO:0009058"> engineer </term> a Cre/loxP system ( Nagy 2000 ) , Gdf5-Cre , that can be used to remove or ectopically <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> genes in joints .
Tests with reporter mice show that this system is capable of modifying genes in all of the structures of the mature synovial joint , including the ligaments of the joint capsule , the synovial membrane , and the articular cartilage .
Gdf5-Cre <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> bypasses the early embryonic lethality of null mutations in Bmpr1a , and shows that this <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> is required for early joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> at some locations and for <termsem="GO:0012502"> initiation of <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> </term> in webbing between digits .
Interestingly , Bmpr1a is also required for postnatal maintenance of articular cartilage throughout most of the skeleton .
In Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP mice , articular cartilage initially <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> normally , but subsequently loses <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of several key cartilage markers after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
It ultimately fibrillates and degenerates , resulting in severe osteoarthritis and loss of <termsem="GO:0050879"> mobility </term> .
These experiments suggest that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is required for normal maintenance of postnatal articular cartilage , and that modulation of the <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling pathway </term> may play an important role in joint disease .
Genetic System for Testing the Function of Genes in Joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> Development </term> .
To generate a general system capable of specifically testing genes for functions in skeletal joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , we <termsem="GO:0000003"> engineered </term> transgenic mice to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints ( Figure 1 ) .
Gdf5 is a gene strongly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in stripes across <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skeletal elements during embryonic joint formation .
A bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) containing the Gdf5 locus was modified by homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in bacteria to insert a cassette encoding Cre-internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) - human placental <termsem="GO:0004035"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> alkaline phosphatase </term> </term> ( hPLAP ) into the <termsem="GO:0006413"> <termsem="GO:0006412"> translation </term> start </term> site of Gdf5 ( Figure 1A ) .
This modified BAC was then used to <termsem="GO:0000003"> make </term> lines of transgenic mice .
The resulting Gdf5-Cre transgenic mice were tested for transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> activity by crossing them to R26R reporter mice that activate the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of lacZ after Cre-mediated removal of <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> stop </term> sequences ( Soriano 1999 ) .
The resulting progeny were analyzed both for <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the transgene by assaying HPLAP activity and for <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination of DNA </term> by assaying LACZ activity .
The progeny from all three lines showed strong LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> primarily in joints , and in two of three lines HPLAP <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> could also be seen in joint regions .
Interestingly , HPLAP <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the Gdf5-Cre transgenic GAC ( A ) line used for all subsequent <termsem="GO:0007618"> breeding </term> experiments was seen to precede LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> during successive <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of joints in the digits ( Figure 1C ) ( unpublished data ) .
These experiments clearly demonstrate that the Gdf5-Cre transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expresses </term> Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> and causes <termsem="GO:0006310"> DNA recombination </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joint regions .
GAC ( A ) mice were crossed with lacZ ROSA26 Cre reporter strain ( R26R ) mice to analyze the pattern of Cre-mediated lacZ <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> throughout <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Joints in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limbs begin <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> in a proximal-distal pattern such that the shoulder joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> prior to the elbow joint .
In addition , three major stages of early joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> have been defined by histology as ( 1 ) interzone <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , ( 2 ) three-layer interzone <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , and ( 3 ) cavitation ( Mitrovic 1978 ) .
Consistent with the proximal-distal pattern of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in the limbs , LACZ activity is seen at embryonic day 12.5 ( E12 .5 ) in the more proximal joints , including the shoulder and knee ( unpublished data ) .
By E14 .5 , LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is typically seen in all but the most distal joints of the limbs ( Figure 1B and 1C ) , but with some variability in both strength and extent of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> from embryo to embryo .
The strongest-staining embryos often have additional staining in fingertips ( not seen in the E14 .5 embryo in Figure 1C , but clearly detectable in the E13 .5 embryo shown in Figure 2 ) .
Sections through <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints show that LACZ is present in many cells at the interzone stage ( unpublished data ) .
However , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of LACZ in nearly 100 % of joint cells is not achieved until the three-layer interzone stage ( for example , in the knee joint at E14 .5 or in any of the phalangeal joints at E16 .5 ( unpublished data ) .
Within the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skeleton , Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of LACZ remains strikingly specific to joints throughout <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Furthermore , it is seen in all the structures of postnatal synovial joints including the articular cartilage , joint capsule , and synovial membrane ( Figure 1D and 1E ) ( unpublished data ) .
These patterns are consistent with the well-established <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Gdf5 in interzone regions during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> ( Storm and Kingsley 1996 ) .
Adult <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns of the Gdf5 gene are not as well characterized , but Gdf5 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> has previously been detected in adult articular cartilage using both <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR and immunocytochemistry ( Chang et al. 1994 ; Erlacher et al. 1998 ; Bobacz et al. 2002 ) .
Other sites besides limb joints also have Cre-mediated lacZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Starting at E13 .5 , LACZ activity is detected in an anterior and posterior domain of the limb bud ( Figure 2C ) .
At E14 .5 , LACZ activity is detectable in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> ear pinnae , ribs , sternum , tissues in the face , and some regions of the brain and spinal cord ( Figure 1B ) ( unpublished data ) .
At <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , LACZ is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in tendons running along the vertebral column , regions of tendons in the wrist and ankle , and some tendon insertions ( Figure 1D ) ( unpublished data ) .
By 5 wk of age , LACZ is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the hair follicles , ear cartilage , some cells in the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate of the long bones , and portions of the brain and spinal cord ( unpublished data ) .
Surprisingly , 23 of 63 , or 37 % of transgenic mice analyzed also show some degree of wider `` ectopic '' LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , which can extend throughout many different tissues in the animal .
However , sustained <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the transgene itself , as assayed by HPLAP activity , is still restricted primarily to joints in animals that show evidence of more generalized <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> based on LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( unpublished data ) .
This suggests that in a fraction of animals , sporadic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Cre at some time early in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> is sufficient to lead to both ectopic <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> and LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
While the fraction of animals with broader <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> patterns must be tracked and accounted for during experiments , these animals offer the potential benefit of revealing additional new functions of target genes that could be subsequently studied with additional site-specific Cre drivers .
Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP Animals Survive to Adulthood with Ear , Webbing , and Joint Defects .
We next used the Gdf5-Cre system to test the role of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> during normal joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Gdf5-Cre transgenic mice were <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> to animals carrying a conditional floxed allele of the Bmpr1a locus ( Mishina et al. 2002 ) , usually in the presence of the R26R reporter allele to facilitate simultaneous visualization of Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> patterns ( see typical cross in Figure 3 ) .
PCR amplification confirmed that a key exon of the Bmpr1a gene was deleted in mice that also carried the Gdf5-Cre transgene ( unpublished data ) .
Previous studies have shown that the <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> Bmpr1afloxP allele mimics a null allele of the Bmpr1a locus when transmitted through the germline ( Mishina et al. 2002 ) .
The Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP conditional knockout mice were viable and survived to adulthood , showing that the Gdf5-Cre driver can bypass the early embryonic lethality previously reported in animals with a null mutation in the Bmpr1a locus ( Mishina et al. 1995 ) .
The viable Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP mice showed several phenotypes .
First , the conditional knockout mice had shorter ears that often lay flatter against their heads than controls ( controls 13.1  0.1 mm long , n = 38 ; mutants 11.8  0.2 mm , n = 11 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
<termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is known to be required for <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> of the external ear of mice ( Kingsley et al. 1992 ) , and this phenotype likely reflects loss of Bmpr1a function in the fraction of ear cells that <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> the Gdf5-Cre transgene .
Most mutant mice also showed soft tissue syndactyly or retention of webbing between the first and second digits of their feet , a phenotype that was more frequent and more severe in the forelimbs ( 201 of 220 , or 91 % , of forefeet and 109 of 220 , or 50 % , of hindfeet ) .
Finally , mutant animals showed obvious skeletal changes in whole-mount skeletal preparations .
At some sites in the ankles , joints seemed to be missing entirely , with fusion of bones that would normally be separate .
For example , the second distal tarsal was fused to the central tarsal bone in every conditional knockout animal examined ( 18 of 18 ) , a phenotype not observed in controls ( zero of 18 ) ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
At other locations , joints had clearly <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> but showed dramatic loss of staining with the cartilage matrix marker Alcian blue ( Figure 3B -- 3E ) ( unpublished data ) .
Normal Alcian blue staining was seen in non-articular regions , such as the cartilaginous <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate ( Figure 3D and 3E , asterisk ) .
These data suggest that Bmpr1a function is required for the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of specific joints in the ankle region and for either generation or maintenance of articular cartilage in most other joints of the limb .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmental </term> Origin of Webbing Phenotype .
Interdigital mesenchyme is normally <termsem="GO:0060033"> eliminated </term> by <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> , a process that can be stimulated by BMP beads , inhibited by Noggin , or blocked by overexpression of dominant-negative BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> ( Garcia-Martinez et al. 1993 ; Yokouchi et al. 1996 ; Zou and Niswander 1996 ; Guha et al. 2002 ) .
Limbs of Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP mutant embryos showed obvious retention of interdigital webbing between the first and second , but not other , digits of E14 .5 forelimbs ( Figure 2A and 2B ) , a pattern that corresponds to the presence or absence of webbing seen in the adult limb .
They also showed excess tissue on the posterior margin of the fifth digit ( Figure 2B , arrow ) .
Analysis of LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Gdf5-Cre/R26R reporter embryos showed that Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> has occurred by E13 .5 in the metacarpal-phalangeal joints , and in the interdigital region between the first and second , but not other , digits .
In addition , a domain of <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of LACZ is also reproducibly seen in the posterior half of the fifth digit ( Figure 2C ) .
<termsem="GO:0003912"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase </term> </term> -- mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) staining of interdigital mesenchyme between the first and second digits ( Figure 2D and 2E ) and the fifth digit flanking mesenchyme showed a decreased number of <termsem="GO:0016265"> dying </term> cells in the regions where excess tissue is retained in the mutant limbs .
Numbers of <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylated </term> histone H3-labeled <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> cells were also elevated in these regions ( Figure 2F ) .
Most cells found in the webbed region between the first and second digits at E15 .5 strongly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> LACZ in Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP mutant embryos ( Figure 2H ) .
These data suggest that regional loss of BMPR1A <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> blocks <termsem="GO:0012501"> programmed cell death </term> in interdigital mesenchyme , and that the <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> cells survive and <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferate </term> in the absence of BMPR1A <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
Failure of Early Joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> Formation </term> in Ankle Regions .
The Bmpr1a gene is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the interzone region of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints at E13 .5 ( Baur et al. 2000 ) .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> showed that the gene is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the interzones of ankle joints and prospective articular cartilage regions of digit joints at E15 .5 ( Figure 4 ) .
LACZ staining indicated that Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> begins to occur in ankle joints around E14 .5 , and is extensive by E15 .5 ( Figure 4G and 4J ) ( unpublished data ) .
In the ankle joint regions that were obviously fused in postnatal mutant animals , alterations in early joint marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> could also be seen by E15 .5 .
At this stage , the Gdf5 gene is normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in stripes that mark the sites of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> ( Figure 4F ) , and the gene for the major collagen protein of cartilage matrix ( Col2a1 ) is <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> in the interzone region ( Figure 4E ) .
In contrast , Col2a1 staining extended completely through the joint region between the second and central tarsal of Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP mutants ( Figure 4H , black arrow ) , and Gdf5 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was seen only as a small notch extending into where the joint should be <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> ( Figure 4I , bracket ) .
These data suggest that the fusions seen between ankle bones in postnatal mutant skeletons are the result of incomplete <termsem="GO:0035282"> segmentation </term> of skeletal precursors during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> , a defect confined to some locations in the ankle .
Failure to Maintain Articular Cartilage in Other Joints .
In most joints of Bmpr1a conditional knockout mice , embryonic <termsem="GO:0035282"> segmentation </term> of skeletal precursors occurred normally .
Although Gdf5-Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> was seen as early as E13 .5 in digit interzone regions ( see Figure 2C ) , no changes in <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> or <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> could be seen in the metacarpal-phalangeal or metatarsal-phalangeal joints at E13 .5 or E14 .5 ( unpublished data ) .
Similarly , although clear LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was seen by E15 .5 in interphalangeal joints and periarticular regions ( Figure 4D ) , no difference in morphology or <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col2a1 , Gdf5 , or Bmpr1b was seen in the articular regions of the phalanges at these stages ( unpublished data ) .
At <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , digit joints were generally indistinguishable from those in control animals ; chondrocytes were abundant in articular regions and were surrounded by typical cartilage matrix with normal staining by Safranin O , a histological stain for proteoglycans ( Figure 5 ) .
At this stage , both wild-type and mutant cells in articular regions also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> high levels of Col2a1 and Aggrecan ( Agg ) , the genes encoding the major structural proteins of cartilage matrix ( Figure 5B and 5G ) ( unpublished data ) .
No alterations in <termsem="GO:0006915"> cellular apoptosis </term> or proliferation were observed ( unpublished data ) .
To determine whether articular cells were properly <termsem="GO:0001708"> specified </term> in mutants , we also analyzed <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Matrilin-4 ( Mat4 ) , a gene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> specifically in the periarticular and perichondral regions of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints ( Klatt et al. 2001 ) .
In both control and mutant animals , <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> of Mat4 was clearly detectable in the articular cartilage layers of newborn joints ( Figure 5D and 5I ) .
In all experiments , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of LACZ throughout articular regions indicated that Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> had occurred throughout the articular regions ( Figure 5C , 5H , 5E , and 5J ) .
The normal histological appearance , staining properties , and marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> patterns suggest that Bmpr1a is not required for the initial formation or <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> of articular cartilage .
By 1 wk after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , obvious differences began to be detected in the articular regions of mutant animals .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col2a1 was reduced throughout the articular surfaces of the carpals , metacarpals , and phalanges of the forefeet ( unpublished data ) .
Less severe reductions were also seen in articular cells of tarsals and metatarsals in the hindfeet ( unpublished data ) .
By 2 wk of age , Col2a1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was reduced in most cells of the articular region ( Figure 5L and 5Q ) , accompanied by markedly reduced Safranin O staining ( Figure 5K and 5P ) , and decreased <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agg and two genes normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in more mature articular cartilage cells , Collagen 3 ( Col3a1 ) and Collagen 10 ( Col10a1 ) ( Figure 5M and 5R ) ( unpublished data ) ( Eyre 2002 ) .
Inhibition of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> in cultured chondrocytes has previously been reported to induce Collagen 1 ( Col1a1 ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , increase <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> , and result in cells with flattened , fibroblast-like morphology ( Enomoto-Iwamoto et al. 1998 ) .
However , we saw no increase in the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col1a1 in mutant articular cartilage , and no <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> was detected in articular cells of either mutant or control animals ( unpublished data ) .
While <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> LACZ marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was detected in most articular cartilage cells , it was also observed in scattered subarticular chondrocytes , <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate chondrocytes , and osteoblasts ( Figure 5O and 5T ) ( unpublished data ) .
Although this implies that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> was defective in multiple cell types , the observed defects were confined to the articular cartilage .
For example , Osteocalcin and Col1a1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appeared normal in osteoblasts ( unpublished data ) .
Together , these data suggest that BMPR1A activity is required in postnatal joint articular cartilage to maintain expression of many genes encoding structural components of cartilage matrix .
Previous studies have shown that Sox9 is required for normal cartilage <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , for expression of cartilage extracellular matrix ( ECM ) genes including Agg , and is a direct <termsem="GO:0030528"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulator </term> </term> of the key cartilage matrix gene Col2a1 ( Bell et al. 1997 ; Lefebvre et al. 1997 ; Bi et al. 1999 ; Sekiya et al. 2000 ) .
Notably , despite reduced expression of many cartilage matrix marker genes in Bmpr1a mutant mice , the SOX9 protein was present at normal levels in articular regions at all stages examined , including newborn , 2-wk-old , 7-wk-old , and 9-mo-old mice ( Figure 5N and 5S ) ( unpublished data ) .
Synovial Hypertrophy , Cartilage Erosion , and Accelerated Cartilage <termsem="GO:0021700"> Maturation </term> .
Conditional loss of Bmpr1a led to marked hypertrophy of the synovial membrane in the joint capsule of some joints , particularly in the ankle region .
In the most severely affected joints , the <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> synovial membrane <termsem="GO:0040007"> grew </term> into the joint space and was associated with obvious loss or erosion of the articular cartilage ( Figure 6A and 6B , asterisks , arrows ) .
Accelerated cartilage <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and increased <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col10a1 was frequently seen in the chondrocytes underlying the articular erosions ( Figure 6C and 6D , brackets ) ( unpublished data ) .
Interestingly , the regions of increased Col10a1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> did not correspond to the regions that had undergone Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
Instead , increased <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col10a1 was seen in a zone of largely LACZ-negative cells stretching from the cartilage adjacent to the <termsem="GO:0001503"> ossification </term> front ( where Col10a1 is normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturing </term> cartilage cells ) , toward the regions where surface articular cartilage was severely eroded or missing ( Figure 6A and 6B , arrowheads ) .
Previous studies suggest that parathyroid <termsem="GO:0005179"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hormone </term> </term> - related protein , a diffusible signal <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> in the articular surface , may normally inhibit <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> of underlying cartilage ( Vortkamp et al. 1996 ; Weir et al. 1996 ) .
Local loss of the articular surface could remove this inhibition and lead to a cell-nonautonomous acceleration of <termsem="GO:0048469"> maturation </term> in chondrocytes underlying points of articular erosion .
This synovial hypertrophy is associated with increased numbers of mononuclear cells resembling synoviocytes or macrophages , cell types that are difficult to distinguish even with surface markers at early postnatal stages .
However , no neutrophils were observed , suggesting that there is little <termsem="GO:0006954"> inflammation </term> .
At later stages synovial hypertrophy is reduced .
Further work will be needed to determine whether synovial <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> is <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> , or whether the synovium becomes enlarged as a <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to nearby skeletal malformations ( such as fusion of the second and central tarsals or defects in the articular cartilage ) .
Noninflammatory Degeneration of Articular Cartilage in Digit and Knee Joints .
Outside of the ankle region , little or no evidence was seen for <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of the synovial membrane .
Instead , mutant mice showed histological signs of osteoarthritis , such as fibrillation of the articular surface ( Figure 7 ) .
As previously seen in 1 - and 2-wk-old animals , Safranin O staining and Agg and Col10 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> were all reduced in mutant articular regions of the forefeet and hindfeet by 7 wk of age , and the beginning signs of cartilage loss were observed ( unpublished data ) .
By 9 mo of age , many regions of articular cartilage were completely missing or extremely fibrillated , leaving regions of exposed bone on the surface ( Figure 7A -- 7D ) .
No alterations were seen in the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Osteocalcin , Col1a1 , or matrix <termsem="GO:0004222"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metalloprotease </term> </term> -13 at either 7 wk or 9 mo. .
The major weight-bearing joint of the hindlimb , the knee , showed changes that closely paralleled that seen in the foot joints .
All markers of cartilage matrix looked similar to controls at E16 .5 , suggesting that early stages of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> were not disrupted ( unpublished data ) .
By postnatal day 7 , Safranin O staining and Col2a1 and Agg <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> were clearly reduced in the mutant , despite continued <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sox9 ( unpublished data ) .
The overall shape of mutant knee skeletal elements appeared similar to controls , although the fibrocartilaginous meniscus that resides between the femur and tibia appeared much less dense in mutants at E16 .5 .
Some cartilage <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in the meniscus region , but the size of these elements was greatly reduced and contained abundant cells with fibrous , noncartilaginous appearance ( unpublished data ) .
This reduction of the meniscus can also be seen in sections from 7-wk - and 9-mo-old animals ( Figure 7E , 7H , 7K , and 7N , arrows ) .
At 7 wk of age the normally domed tibial epiphysis was flattened and depressed in the knees of mutant animals , markedly reducing the distance between the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate and articular surface ( Figure 7E and 7H , vertical bar ) .
Articular cartilage was also thinner than in control animals , showed nearly complete absence of Safranin O staining , and was either acellular or beginning to fibrillate in many regions ( Figure 7F and 7I ) .
The few large Safranin O-stained cells still apparent in mutant articular regions appeared to correspond in position to rare LACZ-negative cells in adjacent sections , suggesting that Bmpr1a is required cell-autonomously in articular cartilage ( Figure 7I and 7J , white arrowheads ) .
By 9 mo , large areas of mutant knees were devoid of articular cells , and the bones of the femur and tibia appeared to rub directly against each other .
Furthermore , the epiphysis of the tibia was extremely depressed , to the point that <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate cartilage was almost exposed through the surface of the bone ( Figure 7K , 7L , 7N , and 7O ) .
In addition , mutants at 7 wk and 9 mo showed subchondral sclerosis , especially in the epiphysis of the femur ( Figure 7E , 7H , 7K , and 7N , asterisks ) .
While subchondral sclerosis is commonly seen in cases of osteoarthritis , it is unclear in this case whether the sclerosis is mainly a <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> of <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> to compensate for decreased articular cartilage , or whether it is the effect of loss of Bmpr1a signaling in some LACZ-positive cells that are also observed in these regions ( unpublished data ) .
The histological signs of joint arthritis were accompanied by functional impairments in both grasping ability and range of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motion </term> in mutant animals .
Gdf5-Cre/Bmpr1afloxP mutant animals showed a highly significantly reduced ability to grasp and remain suspended on a slender rod ( mean suspension time : controls 38  6 s , n = 39 ; mutants 6  3 s , n = 11 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
Mutant mice also showed a clear decrease in the maximum range of <termsem="GO:0050879"> mobility </term> of two different joints in the digits , as assayed by passive manipulation ( MT/P1 joint : controls 100  0  , n = 26 ; mutants 82  3  , n = 8 ; p < 0.0003 ; P1/P2 joint : controls 152  1  , n = 23 ; mutants 140  5  , n = 6 ; p < 0.05 ) .
The structural , histological , marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , and functional changes in mutant mice demonstrate that BMPR1A is required for normal postnatal maintenance of articular cartilage .
Previous studies suggest that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is involved in a large number of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental events </term> .
Many of these events occur early in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , and complete inactivation of BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> causes <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> by E9 .5 ( Mishina et al. 1995 ) .
The Gdf5-Cre <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> system bypasses the early embryonic lethality of Bmpr1a mutations , and provides important new information about the role of this <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> in limb and <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletal development </term> .
The three major limb phenotypes revealed by eliminating Bmpr1a with Gdf5 - <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> Cre include webbing between digits , lack of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> at specific locations in the ankle , and failure to maintain articular cartilage after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , resulting in severe arthritis .
Previous studies have shown that manipulation of <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> alters interdigital <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> during development of the limb , but no experiment has identified a specific member of the <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling pathway </term> that is required for this process ( Yokouchi et al. 1996 ; Zou and Niswander 1996 ; Zou et al. 1997 ; Guha et al. 2002 ) .
Our new loss-of-function data confirm that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is required for interdigital <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> and suggests that Bmpr1a is a critical component for mediating this signal .
At some sites , loss of Bmpr1a function leads to a defect in the early stages of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , resulting in a complete failure to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> a joint and fusion of bones in the ankle .
Mutations in two different ligands in the BMP family , Gdf5 and Gdf6 , the Bmpr1b <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , and in the human Noggin locus ( Storm and Kingsley 1996 ; Gong et al. 1999 ; Baur et al. 2000 ; Yi et al. 2000 ; Settle et al. 2003 ) also produce defects in joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> at specific locations in the limbs .
The joint defects associated with multiple components of the <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP pathway </term> provide strong evidence that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> is required for early stages of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> at some anatomical locations .
Most joints still <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> normally when Bmpr1a is knocked out in Gdf5 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domains .
The lack of joint fusions outside the ankle region could be due to differences in requirement for <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> in different joints , to compensating <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of other BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> outside the ankles , or to differences in the detailed timing of Gdf5-Cre stimulated gene inactivation in ankles and other joint regions .
Comparison of the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the HPLAP marker ( <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> directly by Gdf5 <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> elements ) and the R26R LACZ marker ( <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> following Gdf5-Cre <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> ) suggests that <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> - stimulated changes in <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> may be delayed for a 0.5 -- 1 d in the digit region ( see Figure 1C ) .
In addition , levels of Bmpr1a mRNA and protein may persist for some time following Gdf5-Cre stimulated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> , making it possible to bypass an early requirement for Bmpr1a in joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> at some locations .
Following the decay of Bmpr1a mRNA and protein , the Gdf5-Cre strategy should result in permanent inactivation of Bmpr1a function in <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombined </term> cells .
This system thus provides one of the first strong genetic tests of Bmpr1a function at later stages of joint <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Despite the normal appearance of articular regions and <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> immediately after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , Bmpr1a-deficient animals are unable to maintain the normal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> state of articular cartilage as they continue to <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> and <termsem="GO:0007568"> age </term> .
These results suggest that <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> signaling </term> is essential for continued health and integrity of articular cartilage in the postnatal period .
Articular cartilage is a key component of synovial joints and is one of the few regions in the skeleton where cartilage is maintained into adulthood .
Despite the importance of articular cartilage in joint health and <termsem="GO:0050879"> mobility </term> , little is known about the factors that <termsem="GO:0032502"> create </term> and maintain it in thin layers at the ends of long bones .
In our experiments , articular cartilage lacking Bmpr1a retains some normal characteristics , in that it maintains a very low <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> rate , does not <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Col1a1 , and continues to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> SOX9 , a major <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of structural components of cartilage matrix .
However , several of the most prominent structural components of cartilage matrix fail to be maintained in mutant animals , resulting in decreased synthesis of Col2a1 , Agg , and proteoglycans .
Therefore , BMPR1A appears to maintain articular cartilage primarily through inducing <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of key ECM components .
It is interesting that the SOX9 <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> continues to be <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in mutant cartilage despite loss of Col2a1 , a direct target of this <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> ( Bell et al. 1997 ; Lefebvre et al. 1997 ) .
Previous studies suggest that SOX9 activity can be modified by <termsem="GO:0004672"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protein kinase </term> </term> A ( PKA ) - dependent <termsem="GO:0006468"> protein phosphorylation </term> , or by coexpression of two related proteins , L-SOX5 and SOX6 ( Lefebvre et al. 1998 ; Huang et al. 2000 ) .
In addition , close examination of the order of genes induced during chicken digit <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> reveals that Sox9 turns on first , followed by Bmpr1b with L-Sox5 , and then Sox6 and the cartilage matrix structural components Col2a1 and Agg ( Chimal-Monroy et al. 2003 ) .
These results , together with the altered pattern of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> seen in our Bmpr1a-deficient mice , suggest that BMPR1A <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> may normally act to stimulate SOX9 by <termsem="GO:0043687"> post - <termsem="GO:0006412"> translational </term> protein modification </term> , or to induce L-Sox5 or Sox6 in cartilage to maintain <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ECM components .
These models are consistent with the ability of BMP2 to both increase PKA activity and induce <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sox6 in tissue culture cells ( Lee and Chuong 1997 ; Fernandez-Lloris et al. 2003 ) .
Although we have tried to monitor the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of L-Sox5 or Sox6 in postnatal articular cartilage , and test the <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylation </term> state of SOX9 using previously described reagents ( Lefebvre et al. 1998 ; Huang et al. 2000 ) , we have been unable to obtain specific signal at the late postnatal stages required ( unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , null mutations in L-Sox5 or Sox-6 cause lethality at or soon after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , and no effect on cartilage maintenance has been reported ( Smits et al. 2001 ) .
However , it seems likely that these or other processes <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> cooperate with SOX9 to induce target genes in articular cartilage .
Mutation of Smad3 or <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of dominant negative transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term>  ( TGF- ) type II receptor also disrupts normal articular cartilage maintenance ( Serra et al. 1997 ; Yang et al. 2001 ) .
Both manipulations should disrupt TGF rather than <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> , and both manipulations cause articular cartilage to hypertrophy and be replaced by bone .
In contrast , our analysis of Bmpr1a mutant articular cartilage showed a loss of ECM components , but no signs of hypertrophy or bone replacement .
Therefore , TGF and <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> are playing distinct but necessary roles to maintain articular cartilage .
Although BMPs were originally isolated on the basis of their ability to <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0001503"> bone formation </term> , their presence in articular cartilage and strong effect on <termsem="GO:0051216"> cartilage formation </term> has stimulated interest in using them to repair or <termsem="GO:0031099"> regenerate </term> cartilage defects in adult animals ( Chang et al. 1994 ; Erlacher et al. 1998 ; Edwards and Francis-West 2001 ; Chubinskaya and Kuettner 2003 ) .
The failure to maintain articular cartilage in the absence of normal BMPR1A function suggests that ligands or small molecule <termsem="GO:0048018"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> agonists </term> </term> that interact specifically with this <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> subtype may be particularly good candidates for designing new approaches to maintain or heal articular cartilage at postnatal stages .
Lack of Bmpr1a function in articular cartilage results in severe fibrillation of the articular surface and loss of joint <termsem="GO:0050879"> mobility </term> .
The development of severe arthritis symptoms in Bmpr1a-deficient mice raises the possibility that defects in <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> also contribute to human joint disease .
Osteoarthritis is known to have a significant genetic component , but it likely involves multiple genetic factors that have been difficult to identify ( Spector et al. 1996 ; Felson et al. 1998 ; Hirsch et al. 1998 ) .
Humans that are heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations in BMPR1A are known to be at risk for juvenile polyposis ( Howe et al. 2001 ; Zhou et al. 2001 ) , but the risk of osteoarthritis for these people has not been reported .
However , the control mice used in this study were heterozygous for a null allele of Bmpr1a , and they showed little sign of osteoarthritis even late in life .
Several chromosome regions have been previously linked to arthritis phenotypes in humans using either association studies in populations or linkage studies in families .
It is interesting to note that several of these chromosome regions contain genes encoding different members of the <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling pathway </term> , including the BMP5 gene on human chromosome 6p12 ( Loughlin et al. 2002 ) , the MADH1 gene on human chromosome 4q26 -- 4q31 ( Leppavuori et al. 1999 ; Kent et al. 2002 ) , and the BMPR2 <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> on human chromosome 2q33 ( Wright et al. 1996 ) .
The complex nature of human osteoarthritis suggests that interactions between multiple genes may be involved in modifying susceptibility to the disease .
The inclusion of genetic markers near <termsem="GO:0030509"> BMP signaling </term> components may help identify additional osteoarthritis susceptibility loci and facilitate the search for causative mutations .
Development and disease processes in synovial joints have been difficult to study genetically , because synovial joints are <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> and function at relatively late stages of vertebrate <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
The Gdf5-Cre system provides a new method for restricting <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> or inactivation primarily to articular regions , thus avoiding the pleiotropic functions of many genes in other tissues .
Depending on the configuration of the floxed target gene , this system can be used to either activate the expression of a gene primarily in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> joints ( ssee Figure 1B -- 1D ) , or to inactivate gene function in articular regions ( see Figure 3 ) .
Additional studies with this system should greatly enhance our knowledge of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , function , and disease mechanisms of joints , and may bring us closer to better prevention and treatment of joint diseases .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of Gdf5-Cre transgenic mice .
A mouse 129x1/SvJ BAC library ( Invitrogen ) was screened to identify a 140-kb BAC from the Gdf5 locus .
This BAC was modified using a homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> system in E. coli ( Yang et al. 1997 ) to place nuclear - <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> ( from plasmid pML78 , gift of Gail Martin ) followed by IRES-hPLAP ( from plasmid 1726 , gift of Oliver Bogler ) directly behind the ATG start site of Gdf5 .
In the process , 583 bp of the first exon of Gdf5 was removed and no functional GDF5 protein is predicted to be <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> .
The 5  homology arm was subcloned from a PCR product tailed with XhoI and Bsp120I restriction sites that contains 781 bp of 5  genomic Gdf5 sequence ending at the ATG <termsem="GO:0006413"> <termsem="GO:0006412"> translation </term> start </term> site ( forward primer 5  - CTGTCTCGAGATGAGGTGGAGGTGAAGACCCC-3  ; reverse 5  - GTTTGGGCCCATCCTCTGGCCAGCCGCTG-3  ) .
Cre was subcloned from a 1.1-kb Bsp120I/EcoRI fragment of pML78 .
IRES hPLAP was subcloned from a 2.1-kb PCR product tailed with EcoRI and SpeI sites that contains the hPLAP <termsem="GO:0006415"> <termsem="GO:0006412"> translation </term> stop </term> site ( forward primer 5  - ATCTCTCGAGGAATTCTCCACCATATTGCCGTCTTTTG-3  ; reverse 5  - AGAACTCGAGACTAGTCGGGACACTCAGGGAGTAGTGG-3  ) .
The 3  homology arm was subcloned from a 0.8-kb PCR product amplified from a 0.9-kb XhoI Gdf5 genomic subclone containing part of the first exon and downstream intron .
The forward primer contains the 3  end of the first exon and is tailed with a SpeI site ; the reverse primer is from the T7 promoter of the vector containing the 0.9-kb subclone and flanks the intronic XhoI site ( forward primer 5  - CTAAACTAGTCACCAGCTTTATTGACAAAGG-3  ; reverse 5  - GATTTCTAGAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3  ) .
The targeting construct was <termsem="GO:0009058"> built </term> and verified in pBSSK ( Stratagene , La Jolla , California , United States ) , then <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> with XhoI and subcloned into pSV1 , the vector used for homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> ( Yang et al. 1997 ) .
Southern blotting , PCR , and DNA sequence analysis confirmed the appropriate targeting construct and BAC modifications were <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> ( unpublished data ) .
Before the modified BAC was injected to <termsem="GO:0000003"> produce </term> transgenic animals , a loxP site present in the BAC vector , pBeloBAC11 , was removed to prevent the addition of undesired Cre target sites into the genome .
To do this , BAC DNA was prepared by CsCl separation , <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> with NotI to free the insert from the vector , and size-fractionated over a sucrose gradient .
Aliquots of fractions were run on a pulse-field gel and Southern blotted using vector-specific DNA as a probe .
Fractions containing unsheared insert and almost no detectable vector DNA were dialyzed in microinjection buffer ( 10 mM Tris [ pH 7.4 ] with 0.15 mM EDTA [ pH 8.0 ] ) using Centriprep-30 concentrators ( Millipore , Billerica , Massachusetts , United States ) .
This purified insert DNA was adjusted to 1 ng/l and injected into the pronucleus of <termsem="GO:0009566"> fertilized </term> eggs from FVB/N mice by the Stanford Transgenic Facility .
Transgenic founder mice were identified by PCR using Cre-specific primers 5  - GCCTGCATTACCGGTCGATGCAACGA-3  and 5  - GTGGCAGATGGCGCGGCAACACCATT-3  , which amplify a 725-bp product , and were assessed for absence of BAC vector using vector-specific primers 5  - CGGAGTCTGATGCGGTTGCGATG-3  and 5  - AGTGCTGTTCCCTGGTGCTTCCTC-3  , which amplify a 465-bp product .
Three lines of Gdf5-Cre mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> established </term> and maintained on the FVB background .
<termsem="GO:0007618"> Matings </term> with R26R Cre-inducible LACZ reporter mice ( Soriano 1999 ) were used to test for Cre activity .
Staining for LACZ and HPLAP on whole embryos or sections of embryos was accomplished following established protocols ( Lobe et al. 1999 ) .
The red LACZ substrate ( see Figure 1E ) is 6-chloro-3-indoxyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside ( Biosynth International , Naperville , Illinois , United States ) .
General characterization of Bmpr1a mutant mice .
Bmpr1a null and floxed alleles ( Ahn et al. 2001 ; Mishina et al. 2002 ) were obtained on a mixed 129 and C57BL/6 background and maintained by random <termsem="GO:0007618"> breeding </term> .
Mice carrying the null and floxed alleles were typically <termsem="GO:0007618"> mated </term> to Gdf5-Cre mice as shown in Figure 3 .
The resulting mice are on a mixed 129 ; C57Bl/6 ; FVB/N background , with both controls and mutant animals <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> as littermates from the same <termsem="GO:0007618"> matings </term> .
Whole-mount skeletal preparations were made from 34 - to 36-d-old mice ( Lufkin et al. 1992 ) .
Pairs of ears from euthanized 6-mo-old animals were removed , pinned , photographed , projected , and measured from the base of the curve <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> between the tragus and antitragus to the farthest point at the edge of the pinnae .
Grasping ability in 6-mo-old mice was measured by placing animals on a slender rod and timing how long they could remain suspended on the rod , to a maximum time allowed of 2 min .
Data from five consecutive trials for each mouse were averaged .
Range of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motion </term> assays were conducted on the MT/P1 and P1/P2 joints of the second hindlimb digit from euthanized 18-wk-old animals .
Forceps were used to bend the joint to its natural stopping position , and the resulting angle was measured to the nearest 10  under 12.5  magnification using a 360  reticule .
Analysis described in this section occurred on animals lacking R26R .
Control mice included all nonmutant genotypes <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by Parent 1 being heterozygous for Gdf5-Cre and Bmpr1anull and Parent 2 being heterozygous for Bmpr1afloxP ( see Figure 3 ) .
All statistical analysis used the Student 's t-test or Welch 's t-test , and values listed are mean  standard error of the mean .
<termsem="GO:0008219"> Cell death </term> and proliferation assays .
Limbs from mutant and control animals at E13 .5 and E14 .5 were dissected and frozen in OCT ( Sakura Finetek , Torrence , CA , United States ) .
Cryosections of tissue were assayed by TUNEL using the In Situ <termsem="GO:0008219"> Cell Death </term> Detection Kit , Fluorescein ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) .
Following TUNEL , slides were washed in PBS , blocked with PBS + 0.05 % Tween-20 + 5 % goat serum , washed again , and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of a rabbit anti-phospho-histone-H3 antibody called <termsem="GO:0007067"> Mitosis </term> Marker ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , New York , United States ) to identify cells in <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> .
Cy3-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used to detect the antibody .
Cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI , and slides were mounted in Vectamount ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , California , United States ) and visualized at 100  magnification .
The area of selected anatomical sites were measured , and the number of TUNEL-labeled nuclear fragments and the number of Cy3-labeled nuclei were counted from three 10-m sections spanning 50 m , from three control and three mutant animals .
The number of labeled cells in the metacarpal-phalangeal and metatarsal-phalangeal joints was counted in a 290 m  365 m rectangle placed around the center of the joint .
The posterior region of the fifth digit was defined by drawing a line from the tip of the digit down 2.15 mm and across to the lateral edge of the tissue .
For this analysis , the R26R Cre reporter was not present .
Tissue from animals ranging from stages E14 .5 to P14 was prepared for analysis by fixing in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 45 min to 4 h depending on the stage ; washing three times in PBS , once in PBS + 15 % sucrose for 1 h , and once in PBS + 30 % sucrose for 2 h to overnight depending on the stage ; and then freezing in OCT. .
Tissue from animals aged 7 wk to 9 mo was processed similarly to earlier stages except that it was decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA ( pH 7.4 ) for 4 d prior to incubating in sucrose .
All solutions were prechilled and used at 4 C with agitation , and skin from tissues of P0 or older mice was lacerated or removed prior to processing .
Tissue was then cryosectioned at 12 m and processed .
Staining of sections with Safranin O , Fast Green , and Harris ' hematoxylin was carried out using standard histological procedures .
Detection of LACZ activity with X-Gal was performed as described ( Lobe et al. 1999 ) and was followed by refixing in 4 % PFA , rinsing with deionized water , counterstaining with Nuclear Fast Red ( Vector Labs ) , rinsing with water again , and then mounting in Aquamount ( Lerner Labs , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States ) .
RNA in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> was performed as described ( Storm and Kingsley 1996 ) , with the following modifications : ( 1 ) Prior to the <termsem="GO:0006473"> acetylation </term> step , sections were incubated with 10 -- 20 g/ml <termsem="GO:0008233"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> proteinase </term> </term> K for 30 s to 7 min at room temperature ( depending on the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stage ) , followed by refixing in 4 % PFA and washing three times in PBS ; ( 2 ) prehybridization step was skipped , and ( 3 ) embryonic tissue sections used a different color development mix ( Thut et al. 2001 ) .
Probes for the following genes have been published previously : Bmpr1a ( Mishina et al. 1995 ) , Col2a1 ( Metsaranta et al. 1991 ) , Col10a1 ( Apte et al. 1992 ) , Gdf5 ( Storm and Kingsley 1996 ) , Osteocalcin ( Celeste et al. 1986 ) , and Sox5 and Sox6 ( Lefebvre et al. 1998 ) .
The following probe templates were gifts : Agg , Dr. Vicki Rosen , Genetics Institute ; Bmp2 and Bmp4 , Arend Sidow , Stanford University ; Col1a1 , Bjorn Olsen , Harvard Medical School ; Bmpr1b , Col3a1 , and Mat4 probes were <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> from ESTs with IMAGE clone numbers 5056341 , 478480 , and 406027 , respectively ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , California , United States ) .
Sections for immunohistochemistry were fixed in 4 % PFA , then <termsem="GO:0009056"> digested </term> with 942 -- 2,000 U/ml type IV-S bovine hyaluronindase ( Sigma , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) in PBS ( pH 5 ) at 37 C for 30 min to 2 h depending on the stage .
Slides were then washed in PBS , treated with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide in 100 % methanol for 30 min , washed , blocked with PBS + 0.05 % Tween20 + 5 % goat or fetal bovine serum , washed again , and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS + 0.05 % Tween 20 + 1 % goat or fetal bovine serum overnight at 4 C .
Biotin-labeled secondary antibodies ( Vector Labs ) were tagged with HRP using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit ( Vector Labs ) followed by detection with DAB ( Vector Labs ) .
Primary antibodies and dilutions used were : goat anti-mouse MMP13 , 1:100 ( Chemicon International , Temecula , California , United States ) ; rabbit anti-human SOX9 , 1:500 ( Morais da Silva et al. 1996 ) ; rabbit anti- <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylated </term> - SOX9 ( SOX9.P ) , 1:10 -- 1:250 ( Huang et al. 2000 ) .

At <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , articular cartilage of controls ( A -- E ) and mutants ( F -- J ) appears similar by Safranin O staining ( A and F ) , and Col2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( B , G ) .
Mat4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> confirms that articular cartilage is initially <termsem="GO:0007389"> specified </term> in mutants ( D andI , brackets ) .

( K -- T ) Near adjacent sections of the metacarpal-phalangeal joints of P14 mice .
Two weeks after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , articular cartilage of controls stains with pericellular Safranin O ( orange staining , K ) , and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expresses </term> Col2 ( L ) , Agg ( M ) , and SOX9 ( N ) .
In contrast , mutant articular cells are smaller and more densely packed , lack pericellular Safranin O staining ( P ) , have reduced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Col2 ( Q ) and Agg ( R ) , but retain normal levels of SOX9 protein ( S , brackets ; dashed line marks faint edges of articular surfaces ) .

( A and B ) LACZ staining ( blue ) shows Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> is largely restricted to articular ( arrowheads ) and synovial cells ( asterisks ) in both controls and mutants .
( C and D ) In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> shows Col10 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> expands in mutants toward regions of synovial membrane <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> and articular surface erosion ( brackets and arrows ) .
This may be a cell nonautonomous effect of joint damage , since the LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> cells at the articular surface do not show <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> of Col10 ( arrowheads ) and the region of expanded Col10 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is largely made up of cells that have not undergone Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .

Loss of Bmpr1a <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> Leads to Articular Cartilage Fibrillation and Degeneration in Digits and Knees of <termsem="GO:0007568"> Aging </term> Mice .
( A -- D ) Near adjacent sections of metatarsal-phalangeal joints from 9 month old mice .
Articular cartilage of controls is complete and stains strongly with Safranin O ( A , orange stain ) .
In contrast , articular cells of mutants are severely fibrillated or absent with much reduced staining of Safranin O ( C , arrowheads ) .
LACZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> confirms Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> has occurred in articular cells ( B and D ) .
( E -- P ) Sagittal sections through knee joints of 7-wk - ( E -- J ) or 9-mo-old animals ( K -- P ) ; fe , femur ; ti , tibia ; gp , <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> plate .
Seven weeks after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , the height of the tibial epiphysis is reduced in mutants ( E and H , bars ) , and their articular layer stains poorly with Safranin O , is fibrillated , and is strikingly thinner ( F and I , black arrowhead , and brackets ) .
Near adjacent sections with LACZ staining confirm Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> has occurred in articular cells ( G and J ) .
Note that in mutants , LACZ is absent in cells adjacent to those that do stain with Safranin O , suggesting Bmpr1a may act cell autonomously ( I and J , white arrowheads ) .
At 9 mo old , the mutant tibial epiphysis is extremely thin ( K and N , bars ) , and the articular layer is completely absent , leaving bone to rub directly on bone ( L and O , bracket ) .
LACZ staining shows Cre-mediated <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> occurred in articular cells of controls ( M ) and in some remaining skeletal tissue of mutants ( P ) .
Also note aberrantly <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> meniscal cartilage in mutants ( E , H , K , and N , arrows ) , and increased sclerosis in mutant epiphyses ( E , H , K , and N , asterisks ) .
