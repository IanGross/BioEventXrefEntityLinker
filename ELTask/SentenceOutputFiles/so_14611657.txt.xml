Odorant receptor <termsem="SO:0000345"> <termsem="SO:0000673"> expressed sequence </term> tags </term> demonstrate olfactory expression of over 400 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , extensive alternate splicing and unequal expression levels .
Previous computational analyses have identified approximately 1,500 mouse olfactory receptors , but experimental evidence confirming olfactory function is available for very few receptors .
A mouse olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library was screened to obtain olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000345"> <termsem="SO:0000673"> expressed sequence </term> tags </term> , providing evidence of olfactory function for many additional olfactory receptors , as well as identifying <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure and putative <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> .
The olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family is one of the largest in the mammalian <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
Previous computational analyses have identified approximately 1,500 mouse olfactory receptors , but experimental evidence confirming olfactory function is available for very few olfactory receptors .
We therefore screened a mouse olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library to obtain olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000345"> <termsem="SO:0000673"> expressed sequence </term> tags </term> , providing evidence of olfactory function for many additional olfactory receptors , as well as identifying <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure and putative <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> .
We identified more than 1,200 odorant receptor <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> representing more than 400 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Using real-time PCR to confirm expression level differences suggested by our screen , we find that <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels in the olfactory epithelium can differ between olfactory receptors by up to 300-fold .
Differences for one <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> pair are apparently due to both unequal numbers of expressing cells and unequal <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels per expressing cell .
At least two-thirds of olfactory receptors exhibit multiple transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> , with <termsem="SO:0001060"> alternative isoforms </term> of both 5 ' and <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated regions </term> .
Some <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> ( 5 % ) utilize <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice sites </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> , contrary to the stereotyped olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure .
Most atypical <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> encode nonfunctional olfactory receptors , but can occasionally increase receptor diversity .
Our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection confirms olfactory function of over one-third of the intact mouse olfactory receptors .
Most of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were previously annotated as olfactory receptors based solely on <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity .
Our finding that different olfactory receptors have different expression levels is intriguing given the one-neuron , one - <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression regime of olfactory receptors .
We provide <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' untranslated region sequences </term> and candidate <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> for more than 300 olfactory receptors , valuable resources for computational regulatory motif searches and for designing olfactory receptor microarrays and other experimental <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> .
The interaction of olfactory ( or odorant ) receptors with their odorant ligands is the first step in a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell .
The olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family is one of the largest in the mammalian <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , comprising about 1,500 members in the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> [ 1,2 ] .
Olfactory receptors were originally identified in an elegant experiment based on the hypothesis that they would be seven-transmembrane - <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> proteins encoded by a large , diverse <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family whose expression is restricted to the olfactory epithelium [ 3 ] .
Subsequent studies have shown that some of these receptors do indeed respond to odorants and can confer that responsivity when expressed in heterologous cell types ( for example [ 4 ] ) .
Recent computational investigations have provided the almost complete human [ 5,6 ] and mouse [ 1,2 ] olfactory receptor - <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> catalogs .
However , the assignment of most of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> as olfactory receptors is based solely on similarity to one of a relatively small number of <termsem="SO:0000312"> experimentally confirmed </term> mouse olfactory receptors or , worse , on similarity to a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> that in turn was defined as an olfactory receptor solely by similarity .
While similarity-based <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> annotation is a good initial method to identify <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and predict their function , in some cases it can be misleading , as <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of similar <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> can carry out different functions and be expressed in different tissues ( for example , the sugar transporter <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family [ 7 ] ) .
A small subset of olfactory receptors appears to be expressed in non-olfactory tissues , principally the testis [ 8 ] , but also taste tissues [ 9 ] , prostate [ 10 ] , erythroid cells [ 11 ] , notochord [ 12 ] and perhaps other tissues .
Expression in the testis has led some investigators to suggest that a subset of olfactory receptors may function as spermatid chemoreceptors [ 8 ] .
Recent studies of one human testis-expressed olfactory receptor indicate that it does indeed function in sperm chemotaxis [ 13 ] .
Due to the paucity of experimental evidence of the olfactory function of most <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the family and suggestions of extra-olfactory roles , we embarked on an olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000345"> <termsem="SO:0000673"> expressed sequence </term> tag </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> ) project to confirm olfactory epithelial expression of hundreds of mouse odorant receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Within the olfactory epithelium , individual olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> show an intriguing expression pattern .
Each olfactory receptor is expressed in a subset of cells in one of four zones of the epithelium [ 14,15 ] .
Furthermore , each olfactory neuron expresses only one <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> [ 16 ] of a single olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 17,18 ] , and the remaining approximately 1,499 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are transcriptionally inactive .
While the mechanism ensuring singular expression is unknown , many hypotheses have been proposed [ 14,16,19 ] .
In one model , somatic <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> recombination would bring one olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> into a transcriptionally active <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> configuration , as observed for the yeast mating type <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> [ 20 ] and the mammalian immunoglobulin <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 21 ] .
Alternatively , a second model invokes a combinatorial code of <termsem="SO:0000235"> transcription factor binding sites </term> unique to each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
This is unlikely , however , as even olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenes </term> with identical upstream <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> are expressed in different neurons [ 18 ] .
In a third model , there would be a limiting quantity of transcription factors - the cell might contain a single transcriptional ` machine ' that is capable of accommodating the <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> of only one olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , similar to the expression site body used by African trypanosomes to ensure singular expression of only one set of <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> surface glycoprotein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 22 ] .
Finally , in a fourth model , transcriptional activity at one stochastically chosen olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> might send negative feedback to repress activity of all other olfactory receptors and/or positive feedback to enhance its own expression .
In the latter three models , some or all olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> might share transcription factor binding motifs , and in the first model , olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> might share a common <termsem="SO:0000298"> recombination signal </term> .
In order to perform computational and experimental searches for such signals , it is important to have a better idea of the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcriptional start site </term> of a large number of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Our olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> collection provides 5 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) sequences for many <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and , therefore , a large dataset of candidate <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> .
Olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have an intronless <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> , simplifying both computational and experimental olfactory receptor identification .
For a small number of olfactory receptors , <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure has been determined .
Additional <termsem="SO:0000445"> 5 ' untranslated exons </term> lie upstream of the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> and can be alternatively spliced [ 19,23-26 ] .
The <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> is typically intronless .
Exceptions to this stereotyped structure have been described for some human olfactory receptors , but are thought to be rare [ 25-27 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> identification and RACE data have been used to determine <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure for about 30 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , see , for example , [ 19,23 ] .
However , computational prediction of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> location </term> of 5 ' upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> and the extent of the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> from <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequence </term> has been extremely difficult .
A combination of <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice site </term> predictions and similarity to other olfactory receptors has allowed some investigators to predict 5 ' <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> locations </term> for around 15 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 25,28 ] .
Experimental validation shows that some , but not all , predictions are accurate [ 24,25 ] .
The total number of olfactory receptors for which <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure is known is vastly increased by our study .
In this report , we describe the isolation and analysis of over 1,200 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> representing 419 odorant receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
We screened a mouse olfactory epithelium library with degenerate olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> and obtained 5 ' end <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000345"> ESTs </term> ) from purified <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> .
These <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> confirm olfactory expression of over 400 olfactory receptors , provide their <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure , demonstrate that not all olfactory receptors are expressed at the same level and show that most olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have multiple transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> .
At least 419 mouse olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are expressed in the olfactory epithelium .
We have isolated 1,264 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clones </term> , which together confirm the olfactory epithelial expression of 419 annotated olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
We used low-stringency hybridization with degenerate olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> to screen around 4,100,000 plaque-forming units ( pfu ) of an adult mouse olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library and around 640,000 pfu of an embryonic olfactory epithelium library .
We obtained <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from 1,715 hybridization-positive <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> following secondary screens to isolate single <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> .
Of these <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> , 1,264 yielded olfactory receptor-containing <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
The 26 % false-positive rate is a consequence of using low-stringency hybridization to obtain maximal sensitivity .
Continuing the screen would have resulted in <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> from additional olfactory receptors , but we reached a point of limiting returns : our final batch of 45 olfactory receptor-positive <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> represented 33 different olfactory receptors , of which only four had not been encountered previously in our screen .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> analysis shows that the libraries are of high quality .
Firstly , directional cloning was successful : only eight out of 1,430 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> with any protein <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> matched that protein on the <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> .
Secondly , <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> contamination is rare : when the 83 olfactory receptor-containing <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> that had a <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR </term> of 400 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> or longer were aligned to <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequence </term> , 80 spliced across at least one <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> , leaving a maximum of three <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ( 3.6 % ) that potentially represent <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> contamination of the libraries .
Thirdly , most <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> are of a reasonable length : although we did not determine whether <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> are full-length , 881 of 1,264 ( 70 % ) olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> contain the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 's <termsem="SO:0000318"> start codon </term> and at least some <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequence </term> .
In order to match <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> to their <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> counterparts , first we updated our catalog of mouse olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 1 ] based on Celera 's most recent <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> ( Release 13 ) [ 29 ] .
Previous reports of the mouse olfactory receptor repertoire [ 1,2 ] were based on the Release 12 <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> .
Release 13 consists of fewer , longer scaffold <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> containing fewer , smaller <termsem="SO:0000730"> gaps </term> than Release 12 .
Using the BLAST-based methods detailed previously [ 1 ] , we identified 1,490 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in the new <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> , including 1,107 intact olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( compared to 866 intact olfactory receptors in the old <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> ) reflecting the reduced <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> error rate and increased coverage of the new <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> ( Table 1 ) .
We created a local database of <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequences </term> including all olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> and 0.5 Mb <termsem="SO:0000239"> flanking sequences </term> ( if available ) and compared each <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequence </term> to this ` olfactory subgenome ' database using sim4 [ 30 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> were assigned to individual <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> based on their best <termsem="SO:0000343"> match </term> to an olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> or its upstream <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( see Materials and methods ) .
Of the 1,264 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , 1,176 matched a total of 419 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ; the remaining <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> either matched an olfactory receptor below our 96 % <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> identity threshold or had ambiguous <termsem="SO:0000343"> matches </term> encompassing more than one olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( see below ) .
A class I olfactory receptor degenerate <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> broadens phylogenetic distribution of <termsem="SO:0000789"> confirmed </term> olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Previous analyses of the mammalian olfactory receptor family define two major phylogenetic clades , referred to as class I and II olfactory receptors , and suggest that class I olfactory receptors are more similar to fish olfactory receptors than are class IIs [ 5 ] .
Figure 1 illustrates the phylogenetic diversity of our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection , showing that we have confirmed expression of at least one olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in each major clade of the class II olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , or 391 out of 983 ( 40 % ) of all intact class II olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> where full-length <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequence </term> data are available ( blue branches ) .
The screen thus appears relatively unbiased in its coverage of class II olfactory receptors .
However , our random screen provided <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> for only two out of 124 intact , full-length class I olfactory receptors .
In an attempt to broaden the phylogenetic coverage of our hybridization screen , we used additional degenerate <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> on the adult library and screened an embryonic library ( Table 2 ) .
These experiments did not increase the diversity of <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> identified ( not shown ) .
This severe class I underrepresentation could be due to experimental bias - a consequence of using degenerate <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> to create our hybridization <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> .
Alternatively , class I <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> might be expressed at extremely low levels in the olfactory epithelium .
In order to determine whether class I olfactory receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium , we designed a <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> - <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> degenerate primer to recognize a motif in transmembrane <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> 7 ( PP { <termsem="SO:0001436"> V </term> / <termsem="SO:0001442"> M </term> / <termsem="SO:0001435"> A </term> / <termsem="SO:0001445"> T </term> } { <termsem="SO:0001441"> F </term> / <termsem="SO:0001437"> L </term> / <termsem="SO:0001438"> I </term> / <termsem="SO:0001442"> M </term> } NP ) enriched among class I olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
Most of the motif is shared among all olfactory receptors , but the first <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline residue </term> ( at the <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> 's 3 ' end ) is found in 121 out of 124 ( 98 % ) intact class I <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> compared to only 37 out of 983 ( 4 % ) intact class II <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
When combined with another olfactory receptor degenerate <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> , P26 [ 17 ] , this <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> preferentially amplifies class I olfactory receptors from mouse <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> : of 33 sequenced , cloned <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> , 17 represented seven different class I olfactory receptors , six represented three different class II olfactory receptors , and ten represented five different non-olfactory receptor contaminants .
Degenerate PCR , cloning , and sequencing from reverse-transcribed olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> showed that at least seven class I olfactory receptors are expressed , as well as one additional class II <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( colored red in Figure 1 ) .
However , no <termsem="SO:0000006"> products </term> could be obtained from the adult or the fetal olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> libraries using the class I <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> , suggesting that the libraries contain very low levels of class I olfactory receptors .
We also confirmed expression of nine additional olfactory receptors ( three class I and six class II , colored red in Figure 1 ) from subclades that were poorly represented in our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> screen using <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - specific <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pairs to amplify <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library or reverse-transcribed <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> templates .
For two of the class I <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> we had shown to be expressed , we determined relative <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels using quantitative RT-PCR ( see below ) .
Expression levels were similar to those observed for <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were represented in our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection , suggesting that class I olfactory receptors are not under-represented in the olfactory epithelium , and that the dearth of class I <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> in our screen is likely to be due to bias in the libraries and/or hybridization <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> .
Some olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are expressed at higher levels than others .
Our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> screen suggests that some olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are expressed at higher levels than others .
If all olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were expressed at equal levels , and our screen and library were unbiased in their coverage of the class II olfactory receptors , the number of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> detected per class II olfactory receptor should follow a Poisson distribution , calculated based on the assumption that all 983 intact class II olfactory receptors have an equal chance of being represented in the screen , but that class I olfactory receptors and <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> can not be found ( Figure 2 ) .
We calculate a low probability ( approximately one in 28 ) that we would observe any <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> with at least eight <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> in the set of 1,176 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> we assigned to single olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
However , for 17 olfactory receptors , we found ten or more <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , suggesting that they might be expressed at higher levels than other olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Figure 2 ) .
The two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which we found most <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ( AY318726/MOR28 and AY318727/MOR10 ) are <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomically </term> adjacent and in the well-studied olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> next to the T-cell receptor / <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> [ 18,31 ] .
Quantitative RT-PCR of six olfactory receptors confirms that expression levels do indeed vary considerably between <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
We used quantitative ( real-time ) PCR to measure olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels of six olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and the ribosomal S16 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in three mice of the same inbred strain ( Figure 3 ) .
These <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> include two olfactory receptors with more than 20 <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , two with one or two <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> and two class I olfactory receptors with no <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> .
In these assays , we measure <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> level per <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> copy of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> by comparing how well a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - specific <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair amplifies reverse-transcribed <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> , relative to a standard curve of amplification of mouse <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> .
We find that expression levels can vary by almost 300-fold between <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( for example , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> A and D , Figure 3 ) .
However , <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> numbers are not a good indicator of expression level , a discrepancy that is likely to be due to bias in the screen ( we used degenerate <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> to make the <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> , which will favor some <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> over others ) and in the libraries ( <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> - dT priming will favor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with shorter <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTRs </term> ) .
For example , we observe large expression differences in all three mice between two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which similar numbers of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> were found ( <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> A and B , Figure 3 ) , and conversely , similar expression levels between two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with a ten-fold difference in number of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> found ( <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> B and C , Figure 3 ) .
Expression levels are mostly consistent between different mice : we find similar expression-level differences between olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in all three mice examined ( that is , the rank order of the six <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> is similar among the three mice ) , although there is variation in expression level of some <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> between mice ( for example , <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> E , Figure 3 ) .
In situ hybridization ( Figure 4 ) shows that increased numbers of expressing cells account for some , but not all , of the difference in <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels between two of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> tested by real-time PCR ( <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> A and D in Figure 3 ) .
We hybridized alternate coronal serial sections spanning an entire olfactory epithelium of a young mouse ( P6 ) with <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> for <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> A and <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> D. Southern blot and BLAST analyses show that both <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> are likely to hybridize to their intended target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and no others ( not shown ) .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> A is expressed in zone 4 of the epithelium according to the nomenclature of Sullivan et al. [ 32 ] ( Figure 4a ) .
The expression pattern of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> D does not correspond to any of the four ` classical ' olfactory epithelial zones [ 14,15,32 ] : positive cells are found in <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of endoturbinates II and III and ectoturbinate 3 , resembling the expression pattern seen previously for the OR37 subfamily and ORZ6 olfactory receptors [ 33,34 ] ( Figure 4b ) .
Counting the total number of positive cells in alternate sections across the entire epithelium , we find that <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> A is expressed in 2,905 cells , about 12 times more cells than <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> D , which is expressed in a total of 249 cells .
This 12-fold difference in numbers of expressing cells does not account for the almost 300-fold difference in <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> levels observed by real-time PCR , implying that the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> level per expressing cell for <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> A is about 25 times higher than <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> level in each expressing cell for <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> D .
We note that hybridization intensities per positive neuron appear stronger for <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> A than <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> D after comparable exposure times , in accordance with the idea that <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels are higher per cell .
Thus , we suggest that expression in more cells and in higher levels per cell together account for the almost 300-fold higher olfactory epithelial <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> levels of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> A relative to <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> D ( Figure 3 ) .
Most olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have several transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> .
Our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection reveals that at least two thirds of the olfactory receptors sampled show alternative splicing of their <termsem="SO:0000445"> 5 ' untranslated exons </term> .
Using a custom script to process sim4 alignments of cDNA and <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequences </term> , we find two to eight <termsem="SO:1001187"> different splice forms </term> for 85 ( 45 % ) of the 191 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which we have had some opportunity to observe alternate splicing ( that is , a minimum of two <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , at least one of which is spliced ) , and 55 ( 67 % ) of the 82 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which we have four or more <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ( and thus a higher chance of observing any alternate splicing ) ( Figure 5 ) .
These alternative splice events are almost all restricted to the <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR </term> and include <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> skipping and alternate <termsem="SO:0000163"> splice-donor </term> and - acceptor use .
At least half of the olfactory receptors represented in our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection utilize more than one <termsem="SO:0000553"> polyadenylation site </term> , resulting in alternative <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> isoforms .
We have crudely estimated <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> size for 1,169 <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clones </term> by combining approximate <termsem="SO:0000667"> insert </term> size information with 5 ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> data .
More than one <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> is predicted for 43 of the 77 ( 56 % ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which there are at least four <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> with <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> size information .
We confirmed the alternative polyadenylation isoforms of four out of five selected <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by sequencing the 3 ' end of 14 <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clones </term> .
These 14 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> also revealed one <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> where the <termsem="SO:0000610"> poly ( A ) </term> tail was added 27 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> before the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> , and another where an <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> was spliced out of the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> , contrary to the conventional stereotype of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure .
A subset of olfactory receptors shows unusual splicing .
We identified 62 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ( 5 % of all olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ) from 38 intact olfactory receptors and one olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> where a <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice site </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000010"> protein - <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding </term> region </term> is used .
For two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( top two <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , Figure 6 ) , the <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> protein appears to be an intact olfactory receptor with three or ten <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , including the initiating <termsem="SO:0001442"> methionine </term> , contributed by an upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> .
A similar <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure was described previously for a human olfactory receptor [ 25 ] .
One of these two mouse <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> has no <termsem="SO:0000318"> start codon </term> in its otherwise intact main <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exon </term> .
The unusual splicing thus rescues what would otherwise be a dysfunctional <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
In most cases ( 60 out of 62 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ) , the unusual <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> appears to be an aberrant <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice form </term> - the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> would probably not encode a functional protein because the splice introduces a <termsem="SO:0000865"> frameshift </term> or <termsem="SO:0000045"> removes </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> functional <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> ( Figure 6 ) .
For two <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ( bottom two <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , Figure 6 ) , <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> order in the <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clone </term> is inconsistent with the corresponding <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequence </term> .
It is difficult to imagine what kind of cloning artefact resulted in these severely scrambled <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> : we suggest that they derive from real but rare <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> .
However , their low frequency in our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection suggests that splicing contrary to <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> organization does not contribute significantly to the olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> repertoire .
For 21 of the 26 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which unusually spliced <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> were found , we also observe an alternative ( ` normal ' ) isoform that does not use <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice sites </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> .
( For the remaining 13 of the 3 ' <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> showing odd splicing , we have identified only one <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> so have not determined whether normal <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> are present . )
We were intrigued both by previous reports of splicing of human olfactory receptors near the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> , where several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> splice over long distances to a common upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> [ 26,27 ] and by the idea that olfactory receptor transcriptional control could be achieved by <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> recombination mechanisms , perhaps with the result that <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> would contain some <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> from another <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
We therefore verified that the entire <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of each olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> matches the corresponding <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 's <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> ` territory ' ( defined for this purpose as from 1 kb after the preceding <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> to 1 kb after the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 's <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> ) .
We found no <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> where <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> encompassed other olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , as reported for olfactory receptors in the human MHC <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> [ 26,27 ] .
Six <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> do extend further than a single <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 's ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> territory </term> ' and appear not to be artifacts of the sequencing or analysis process .
In each of these cases , the <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> use <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice sites </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> and thus extend further than the arbitrary 1 kb downstream of the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> .
Five of these six <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> also use <termsem="SO:0000163"> splice-donor sites </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> and encode disrupted olfactory receptors ( Figure 6 ) .
In the sixth <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> , a 2.6-kb <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> is spliced out of the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> , leaving the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> intact .
If olfactory receptor transcriptional control is achieved by <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> recombination , the beginning of each <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> might derive from a donated <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter region </term> , with the rest of the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> coming from the <termsem="SO:0000782"> native </term> <termsem="SO:0000236"> ORF </term> - containing <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
In order to examine the recombination hypothesis , we analyzed 115 <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clones </term> for which sim4 failed to align 20 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> or more to the corresponding <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> locus </term> .
In most cases , the missing <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> was explained by <termsem="SO:0000730"> gaps </term> in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequence </term> or by <termsem="SO:0000343"> matches </term> that fell below our percent identity-based cutoff for reporting <termsem="SO:0000343"> matches </term> .
For three <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ( from three different olfactory receptors ) , we found that the <termsem="SO:0000730"> missing </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> piece of sequence </term> matched elsewhere in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
Comparison with the public mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> confirmed the distant <termsem="SO:0000343"> matches </term> .
With such a small number of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> exhibiting a possible sign of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> recombination ( a sign that could also be interpreted as <termsem="SO:0000810"> chimeric cDNA clones </term> ) , we conclude that such rearrangement is unlikely to occur .
However , the possibility remains that <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> recombination is responsible for olfactory receptor transcriptional regulation , with the <termsem="SO:0000163"> donated region </term> contributing only <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter sequences </term> but no part of the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> .
Both unclustered olfactory receptors and olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> can be expressed .
We were interested in whether olfactory receptors need to be part of a <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> in order to be transcribed , or if the <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> organization of olfactory receptors is simply a consequence of the fact that local duplication is the major mechanism for expanding the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family [ 1 ] .
` Singleton ' olfactory receptors ( defined as full-length olfactory receptors without another olfactory receptor within 0.5 Mb ) are more often <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> than are olfactory receptors in <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> ( 8 out of 16 versus 271 out of 1,358 ; 2 = 8.8 , P < 0.005 ) .
Of the eight intact singleton olfactory receptors , two have <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> in our collection , a similar proportion as found for olfactory receptors in <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> , showing that <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustering </term> is not an absolute requirement for olfactory receptor expression .
However , it is possible these two expressed singleton <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are part of ` extended ' olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> - their nearest olfactory receptor neighbors are 1.7 Mb and 2.6 Mb away , respectively .
We also find that some olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> are expressed , albeit with a lower probability than intact olfactory receptors .
Considering the 1,392 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene sequences </term> for which reliable full-length data are available , 15 out of 285 ( 5 % ) apparent <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> are represented in our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection , compared to 393 out of 1,107 ( 36 % ) intact olfactory receptors .
However , three of these 15 ` expressed <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> ' are intact <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the public mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome sequence </term> .
The defects in Celera 's <termsem="SO:0001060"> version </term> of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> may be due to sequencing errors or true polymorphism .
Publicly available mouse <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> confirms that 11 of the 12 remaining expressed <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> are indeed <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> .
No public <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> matches the 12th ` expressed <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> ' with 99 % identity or more .
We have identified and sequenced 1,264 odorant receptor <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> from 419 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , confirming their expression in the olfactory epithelium .
We have thus validated the similarity-based prediction of over one-third of the intact olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> annotated in the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> [ 1,2 ] , thereby vastly increasing the proportion of the family for which experimental evidence of olfactory function is available .
We have not found <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> for all olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> or an even phylogenetic distribution of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> , probably because the libraries and/or our screen are biased toward certain olfactory receptor subfamilies .
Using RT-PCR with both degenerate and specific <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> , we have confirmed olfactory expression of a number of additional olfactory receptors , bringing the total number of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> verified in this study to 436 , and ensuring that almost all phylogenetic clades have at least one representative with evidence of olfactory function .
Results of our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library screen suggested that some olfactory receptors are expressed at significantly higher levels than others .
We used quantitative PCR to show that expression levels are indeed highly variable , with one olfactory receptor expressed at almost 300 times the level of another .
Higher expression levels could be due to increased <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> number per cell and/or a greater number of olfactory neurons ` choosing ' those <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
For one pair of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> we tested , expression level differences appear to be due to both factors .
It would be interesting to collect data for additional <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> to determine how the numbers of expressing cells and <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels per cell vary across the olfactory receptor family .
Data from a number of previous studies also show that different olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , or even copies of the same olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> in different <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> locations </term> are expressed in different numbers of cells [ 14,18,35 ] , but do not address the issue of <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> level per cell .
The fact that some <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are chosen more frequently , and when chosen may be expressed at higher levels per cell , is intriguing given each olfactory neuron 's single - <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> expression regime .
The observation of unequal expression leads to a number of questions .
It is known that each olfactory receptor is expressed in one of four zones of the olfactory epithelium [ 14,15 ] ; do some zones choose from a smaller olfactory receptor sub-repertoire and thus express each olfactory receptor in a larger number of cells ?
We note that several apparently highly expressed olfactory receptors ( <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> A , this study , and MOR10 and MOR28 [ 36 ] ) are expressed in zone 4 of the olfactory epithelium .
Does activity-dependent neuronal competition [ 37 ] contribute to increased representation of the olfactory receptors that respond to common environmental odorants ?
Do the favored olfactory receptors have stronger <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter sequences </term> ?
Are some olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNAs </term> more stable than others , leading to higher <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels per expressing cell ?
Are the favored olfactory receptors in more open chromatin conformation or more accessible <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> locations </term> ?
Transcription of apparent ` singleton ' olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( 0.5 Mb or more from the nearest other olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ) suggests that there is no absolute requirement for <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustering </term> for an olfactory receptor to be transcribed , consistent with observations that small olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenes </term> can be expressed correctly when <termsem="SO:0000046"> integrated </term> outside <termsem="SO:0000782"> native </term> olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> [ 35 ] .
However , the high <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> count among singleton olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( 50 % , versus 20 % for <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ) suggests that not all <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> locations </term> are favorable for olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> survival , perhaps due to transcriptional constraints .
It is also possible that evolutionary factors may be responsible for reduced <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> content of <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> olfactory receptors - <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> conversion between neighboring olfactory receptors could rescue inactivating <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , but not singletons .
Before these questions about olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> choice can be answered , it will be important to measure expression levels of a larger number of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , perhaps using an olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> microarray .
Our study provides at least <termsem="SO:0000731"> partial </term> data about the upstream <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> structures of over 300 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
These data provide tentative <termsem="SO:0000001"> locations </term> of a large set of <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> , allowing computational searches for shared sequence motifs that might be involved in the intriguing transcriptional regulation of olfactory receptors .
However , given that not all <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> are full-length <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> , some of these candidates will not be true <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequences </term> we obtained will also aid in the design of experimental <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> , for example , for in situ hybridizations or to immobilize on an olfactory receptor microarray .
One of the challenges of such an array will be to design unique <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> with which to represent each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Often , the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> of olfactory receptors is highly similar between recently duplicated <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Many pairs of similar olfactory receptors show more <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> divergence in the <termsem="SO:0000203"> UTRs </term> than the <termsem="SO:0000010"> protein - <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding </term> region </term> ( J.Y. , unpublished observations ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000203"> UTRs </term> would therefore make a better choice of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> from which to design unique <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> to distinguish closely related olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Locations of these <termsem="SO:0000991"> regions in <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequence </term> are difficult to predict - our study provides <termsem="SO:0000204"> 5 ' UTR sequences </term> of 343 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and the approximate <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> length for 399 olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000051"> Probe </term> design must also account for the multiple transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> observed for many olfactory receptors - depending on the question being asked , <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> could be designed in shared <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> to determine the total level of all <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> , or in unique <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> to measure the level of each <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> separately .
We find that the majority of the olfactory receptors , like most non-olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 38,39 ] , are transcribed as multiple <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> , involving alternative splicing of <termsem="SO:0000445"> 5 ' untranslated exons </term> and alternate <termsem="SO:0000553"> polyadenylation-site </term> usage .
The act of splicing itself may be important for efficient <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> export from the nucleus [ 40 ] or to couple olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding regions </term> with <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomically </term> distant <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoters </term> .
The exact nature of the spliced <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> might be unimportant , such that several <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> might be produced simply because multiple functional <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice sites </term> are available .
Alternatively , the multiplicity of transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> might have functional significance , as <termsem="SO:0000203"> UTRs </term> may contain signals controlling <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> stability , localization or degradation [ 41,42 ] .
Our study shows that about 5 % of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> do not fit the current notion of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure .
Occasionally , an <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> is spliced out of the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> .
A number of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> use <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice sites </term> within the olfactory receptor 's <termsem="SO:0000236"> ORF </term> , meaning that their protein product is different from that <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> on the basis of <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequence </term> alone .
In two such cases , the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> would encode a functional olfactory receptor , with the initiating <termsem="SO:0001442"> methionine </term> and first few <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> encoded by an upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> , as has been observed previously for a subtelomeric human olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 25 ] .
Such within - <termsem="SO:0000236"> ORF </term> splicing might increase protein-coding diversity , although , given the small number of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved , splicing is unlikely to significantly affect the functional receptor repertoire .
Most of the atypical <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice forms </term> we observe appear to encode non-functional <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> , containing <termsem="SO:0000865"> frameshifts </term> or lacking a <termsem="SO:0000318"> start codon </term> or other functional <termsem="SO:0001236"> residues </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> throughout the olfactory receptor family .
These nonfunctional <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> are probably aberrant by-products of the splicing system [ 43 ] that have not yet been degraded by <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> surveillance systems [ 40,41 ] .
The neurons expressing these aberrant <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> might also make normal <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> for the same <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and thus produce a functional olfactory receptor .
Alternatively , the unusual transcriptional regulation of olfactory receptors might ensure that only one <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice isoform </term> is expressed per cell ( unlikely , but possible if an <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> - based feedback mechanism operates ) , thus condemning cells expressing these aberrant <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> to be dysfunctional .
We also observe <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> from a small number of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> , as previously described for three human olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> [ 26,44 ] .
Although many fewer <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> than intact <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were represented in our <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection , some neurons in the olfactory epithelium evidently express disrupted olfactory receptors and thus might be unable to respond to odorants or to correctly innervate the olfactory bulb .
Wang , Axel and coworkers have shown that an artificial <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> containing two nonsense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> can support development of an olfactory neuron , but that <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> - expressing neurons fail to converge on a glomerulus in the olfactory bulb [ 45 ] .
By analogy with an olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> [ 45 ] , it is likely that most <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> - expressing neurons die or switch to express a different olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , leaving a small number of <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> - expressing neurons in adult mice , but at greatly reduced levels compared to neurons expressing intact olfactory receptors .
Our study has provided an olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> resource representing over one-third of the olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
We have thus established over 400 annotated olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> as having olfactory function .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> we generated demonstrate that the majority of the olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family has multiple transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> .
Most olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> encode functional receptor proteins , with rare exceptions .
We show that individual olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> can have vastly different expression levels , an intriguing finding in light of the unusual one-neuron one - <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> transcriptional regime of the olfactory epithelium .
Our results and the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> we provide will facilitate future global studies of the mechanisms and dynamics of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression .
Identification of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> .
An adult mouse <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> library made from the olfactory epithelium of a single animal was provided by Leslie Vosshall ( Rockefeller University , New York , NY , USA ) , and an embryonic library ( made from the olfactory epithelia of several E16.5-E18.5 embryos ) was provided by Tyler Cutforth ( Columbia University , New York , NY , USA ) .
Both libraries were <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> - dT primed and directionally cloned into the lambdaZAP-XR <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
The adult library has a complexity of 6.5  106 primary <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> , and the embryonic library has a complexity of 1.65  106 .
Libraries were amplified to give titers of 5  109 pfu/ml ( adult ) or 2  1010 pfu/ml ( embryonic ) .
Hybridization <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> were made by degenerate PCR of mouse <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> , in a fashion similar to those described previously [ 1 ] , with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pairs and annealing temperatures given in Table 2 .
Low-stringency hybridization conditions were as described [ 1 ] .
Clonally-pure plaques were obtained through secondary screens using the same <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> as the corresponding primary screen .
PCR with <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> ( M13F/R ) was performed to prepare sequencing templates .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> size estimates were obtained by agarose gel electrophoresis , and <termsem="SO:0000667"> inserts </term> were sequenced from the 5 ' end using the M13R <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and big-dye terminator chemistry according to ABI 's protocols ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) .
In order to obtain 3 ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> , selected phage <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were <termsem="SO:0000041"> converted </term> to <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> stocks following a scaled-down version of Stratagene 's in vivo <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> protocol .
<termsem="SO:0000155"> Plasmid </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> gave better 3 ' - end <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> than <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> , which often suffered from polymerase stuttering through the <termsem="SO:0000610"> poly ( A ) tract </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> and associated information are available through dbEST ( Genbank accessions CB172832-CB174569 ) and our olfactory receptor database [ 46 ] .
The updated olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> catalog is available through Genbank ( accessions AY317244-AY318733 ) .
Throughout the manuscript , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are referred to by their Genbank accession numbers .
<termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> were <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> - called and quality-trimmed using phred ( trim_cutoff = 0.05 ) [ 47 ] , and <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector sequences </term> were <termsem="SO:0000045"> removed </term> using cross _ <termsem="SO:0000343"> match </term> [ 48 ] .
Any <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of less than 50 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> after trimming were discarded .
<termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> lengths were estimated by combining approximate <termsem="SO:0000667"> insert </term> sizes determined by PCR with 5 ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> data where possible ( if the 5 ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> did not extend into the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> we could not estimate <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> size ) .
We counted <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> from a given <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> as showing alternative <termsem="SO:0000553"> polyadenylation site </term> usage if <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> length estimates varied by at least 400 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> - smaller variation could be real , but may not be distinguishable from error in our size estimates .
To assign <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> to their corresponding olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , we first defined a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> ` territory ' for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , with the following attributes : <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> , start <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> ( 100 kb upstream of the <termsem="SO:0000318"> start codon </term> or 1 kb after the previous <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> upstream on the same <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> , whichever is closer ) and end <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> ( 1 kb downstream of the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> ) .
Trimmed <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> were compared with <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequences </term> using sim4 [ 30 ] ( settings P = 1 to <termsem="SO:0000045"> remove </term> <termsem="SO:0000610"> polyA </term> tails and N = 1 to perform an intensive search for small <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> ) .
The sim4 algorithm uses <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice-site </term> <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequences </term> to refine alignments .
Only <termsem="SO:0000343"> matches </term> of 96 % or greater <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> identity were considered .
RepeatMasked <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> [ 49 ] were also compared to <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequences </term> ; cDNA : <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequence </term> pairings not found in both masked and unmasked alignments were rejected .
Coordinates from the unmasked alignment were used for further analysis .
Any <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> entirely within a <termsem="SO:0000001"> territory </term> was assigned to that <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
If a <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> matched more than one <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> territory </term> , the best <termsem="SO:0000343"> match </term> was chosen ( that is , the one with highest ` score ' , where score is the total of all <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> ' lengths multiplied by their respective percent identities ) .
We found 27 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> that spanned a larger <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> range </term> than one <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> territory </term> and flagged them for more careful analysis .
Of these , six <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> showed unusual splicing within the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTR </term> , but the remaining ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> territory </term> violators ' were found to be artifacts of the analysis process which fell into three types .
These included : <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> where the <termsem="SO:0000667"> insert </term> appeared to be cloned in the <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> orientation ( six <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ) ; <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from recently duplicated <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> pairs , where sim4 assigned <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> and upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> to different members of the pair , although <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> could equally well have been aligned closer to one another ( six <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ) ; and artifacts due to use of sim4 's N = 1 parameter ( nine <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> ) .
This parameter instructs the program to make extra effort to match small upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> , allowing a greater total length of <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST sequence </term> to be matched .
However , occasionally the N = 1 parameter caused the program to assign very small <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> ( 1-4 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) to distant upstream <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> , when they probably match nearer to the corresponding <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequence </term> .
The expected distribution shown in Figure 2 was calculated using the equation P ( x ) = e-x/x !
, where P ( x ) is the Poisson probability of observing x <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> per <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , and  is the mean number of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> observed per <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> (  = 1,176 / 983 : 1,176 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> matching olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in our dataset and 983 intact class II olfactory receptors ) .
In our analysis of expressed <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> , we ignored two olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> found very near the ends of <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequences </term> and thus likely to be error-prone .
A protein <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignment of intact mouse olfactory receptors was generated using CLUSTALW [ 50 ] , edited by hand , and used to produce the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 using PAUP 's neighbor-joining algorithm ( v4 .0 b6 Version 4 , Sinauer Associates , Sunderland , MA ) .
The tree was colored using a custom script .
Information content ( the measure of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> shown in Figure 6 ) was calculated for each <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> in the alignment using alpro [ 51 ] .
To determine the number of transcriptional <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , we examined the sim4 output for every <termsem="SO:0000343"> matching </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> in decreasing order of number of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> .
The first <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was counted as one <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice form </term> , and for each subsequent <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> , we determined whether <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> structure was mutually exclusive to <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> already counted .
We were conservative in our definition of mutually exclusive , and thus our count represents the minimum number of <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> represented in the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> collection .
The olfactory epithelia were dissected from three adult female C57BL/6 mice , including tissues attached to the skull and septum .
<termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy midi kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) , including a DNase treatment step .
First - <termsem="SO:0000001"> strand </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was produced from 2.5 g of <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> in a volume of 50 l using <termsem="SO:0000449"> random </term> hexamers and Invitrogen 's Superscript II reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , according to the manufacturer 's recommendations .
One-twenty-fifth of the resulting <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was used as template in subsequent PCR reactions .
PCR amplification biased towards class I olfactory receptors was performed using degenerate <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> P26 [ 17 ] and classI_R1 ( 5 ' - GGRTTIADIRYIGGNGG-3 ' ) with an annealing temperature of 44 C .
The <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> was cloned ( TA cloning kit , Invitrogen ) , and individual <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were sequenced .
Specific PCR <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> used to confirm expression of individual olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are given in Additional data file 1 .
Each <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> was sequenced to confirm that the <termsem="SO:0000996"> <termsem="SO:0000732"> expected </term> gene </term> and no others had been amplified .
Control reactions on a template made by omitting reverse transcriptase gave no <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> , indicating that the <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> preparation was uncontaminated by <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> .
Relative <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels were estimated using real-time PCR according to Applied Biosystems ' protocols , with magnesium concentration , <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair and fluorescent <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> given in Additional data file 2 .
The increase in fluorescence during thermocycling was measured on an ABI PRISM 7900HT .
Standard curves were constructed for each <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair using triplicate samples of mouse <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> of nine known concentrations ( range 0.01-100 ng , or about 3-30,000 copies of the haploid <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> ) .
Relative expression level of each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was determined by comparing the mean Ct ( cycle where fluorescence reaches an arbitrary threshold value ) obtained with six replicate samples of reverse-transcribed <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> to the standard curve for the corresponding <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> .
Relative <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> levels of a housekeeping <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , ribosomal S16 , were measured as previously described [ 52 ] .
Control reactions on template prepared by omitting reverse transcriptase amplified at a relative level of 0.03  0.01 ng or less in each case .
Expression measurements of the seven <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were normalized for each mouse so that S16 levels were equal to 1 ( arbitrary units ) .
Coronal sections were cut from the olfactory epithelia of an adult mouse ( Figure 4 ) and a young ( P6 ) C57BL/6 mouse .
<termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously [ 15,53 ] with digoxigenin-labeled <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> riboprobes specific for the <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' UTRs </term> of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> AY318555 ( 0.5 kb ) and AY317365 ( 0.5 kb ) .
Riboprobe <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> were generated by PCR using <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pairs 5 ' - TCTTCCAAACCTGGACCCCCC-3 ' and 5 ' - ATCTCTCCAGCACCTTACTTG-3 ' for AY318555 and <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pairs 5 ' - TAAGATGTAAGTGATAATTTAGATTACAGG-3 ' and 5 ' - TTTCTGCCTCAGCTATGACAG-3 ' for AY317365 .
Hybridization was carried out in 50 % formamide at 65 C , and slides were washed at high stringency ( 65 C , 0.2  SSC ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000051"> probes </term> each hybridize to only one band on a Southern blot , indicating that each <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> only detects one olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
BLAST analyses show that the AY318555 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> is unique in Celera 's mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> ( Release 13 ) , and that the AY317365 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> is similar to only one other <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> .
This potential cross-hybridizing <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> is over 10 Mb from the nearest olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> and is thus highly unlikely to be included in any olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> .

Differential expression levels among six olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> determined by quantitative PCR .
( a ) Expression levels of olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> can vary by almost 300-fold ( for example , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> A and D ) .
Relative expression levels of six selected olfactory receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( A , AY318555 ; B , AY318107 ; C , AY318644 ; D , AY317365 ; E , AY317773 ; and F , AY317797 ) were determined in olfactory epithelium <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> samples from three mice .
Expression levels for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> were first determined relative to a standard curve made using mouse <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> templates , and then values for each mouse were normalized so that a housekeeping <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , ribosomal S16 , had a value of 1 ( arbitrary units ) ( not shown ) .
Error bars show one standard deviation ( six replicate reactions ) .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genes </term> E and F ( AY317773 and AY317797 ) are class I olfactory receptors .
