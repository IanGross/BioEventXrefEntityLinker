A model of tripeptidyl-peptidase I ( CLN2 ) , a ubiquitous and highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> member of the sedolisin family of <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> - carboxyl peptidases .
Tripeptidyl-peptidase I , also known as CLN2 , is a member of the family of sedolisins ( <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> - carboxyl peptidases ) .
In humans , defects in expression of this <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease , classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis .
Similar <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> have been found in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequences </term> of several species , but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted .
We have analyzed the presence of <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> of human CLN2 in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequences </term> of a number of eukaryotic species .
<termsem="SO:0001185"> Enzymes </term> with <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> sharing over 80 % identity have been found in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomes </term> of macaque , mouse , rat , dog , and cow .
Closely related , although clearly distinct , <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> are present in fish ( fugu and zebra ) , as well as in frogs ( Xenopus tropicalis ) .
A three-dimensional model of human CLN2 was built based mainly on the <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> with Pseudomonas sp .
101 sedolisin .
CLN2 is very highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> and widely distributed among higher organisms and may play an important role in their life cycles .
The model presented here indicates a very open and accessible <termsem="SO:0100019"> active site </term> that is almost completely <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> among all <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> CLN2 <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> .
This result is somehow surprising for a tripeptidase where the presence of a more constrained binding pocket was anticipated .
This structural model should be useful in the search for the physiological substrates of these <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> and in the design of more specific inhibitors of CLN2 .
Although the existence of tripeptidyl-peptidase I ( TPP-I ) was first noted over 40 years ago [ 1 ] , the structural and mechanistic basis of its activity has been largely misunderstood until quite recently .
The situation changed after it was shown that TPP-I is identical to an independently characterized <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> named CLN2 .
It was also demonstrated that <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> leading to abolishment of the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymatic </term> activity of CLN2 were the direct cause of a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease , classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [ 2 ] .
This important observation was followed by the identification of CLN2 as a <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> peptidase [ 3,4 ] , without , however , specifying its structural fold and the details of the <termsem="SO:0100019"> catalytic site </term> .
More accurate placement of CLN2 within the context of a family of related <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> became possible only after high-resolution crystal structures of two bacterial <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> with a limited <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity to CLN2 , sedolisin and kumamolisin , became available [ 5-7 ] .
These structures defined a novel family of <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> , now called sedolisins or <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> - carboxyl peptidases , that is characterized by the utilization of a fully <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> catalytic triad ( <termsem="SO:0001444"> Ser </term> , <termsem="SO:0001454"> Glu </term> , <termsem="SO:0001453"> Asp </term> ) and by the presence of an <termsem="SO:0001453"> Asp </term> in the oxyanion hole [ 8 ] .
Sedolisin and its several <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> ( e.g. , kumamolisin , aorsin [ 9 ] , and physarolisin [ 10 ] ) have now been found in archaea , bacteria , fungi and amoebae , whereas the higher organisms seem to contain only <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> of CLN2 [ 8 ] .
The physiological role of sedolisins in the lower organisms has not yet been elucidated .
Despite the potential medical importance of CLN2 and related <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> , no systematic studies of their <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> distribution have been published to date .
There are also no published reports of the crystallization of this <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> .
In the absence of an experimental structure obtained by crystallography or NMR it is sometimes necessary to resort to molecular modeling in order to provide a structural basis for the explanation of the biological properties of an <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> , and , in particular , to initiate design of its inhibitors .
Examples of such very successful and useful modeling efforts are provided by HIV protease [ 11 ] , or very recently by the peptidase from a coronavirus involved in the severe acute respiratory syndrome [ 12 ] , among others .
We have now applied the tools of molecular <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> modeling to predicting a structure of CLN2 that could be used as a basis for a search for the biological substrates of this family of <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> and for the design of specific inhibitors .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> comparisons of the CLN2-like <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> .
Mammalian <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> to human CLN2 [ 2,4 ] form a subfamily of sedolisins with highly <termsem="SO:0000330"> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> sequences </term> ( Figure 1 ) .
These <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> are expressed with a <termsem="SO:0001062"> prosegment </term> consisting of 195 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> that is cleaved off during maturation , yielding the active catalytic <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
Complete <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> are available for CLN2 from six species in which it has been found so far ( human , macaque , dog , mouse , rat , and cow ) .
The full-length <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> consist of 563 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> arranged in a single <termsem="SO:0000104"> polypeptide chain </term> containing both the <termsem="SO:0001062"> prosegment </term> and the catalytic <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , with the exception of mouse CLN2 that has a single <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> in the <termsem="SO:0001062"> prosegment </term> .
The overall <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> identity for these <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> is 81 % , whereas the similarity is 92 % .
A pairwise comparison of the human and mouse <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> yields 88 % identity and 94 % similarity , considerably higher than the median 78.5 % identity reported for all identified mouse-human <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> [ 13 ] .
Thus , mammalian CLN2 appears to be a highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> comparisons of mammalian CLN2-like <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> .
These <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> correspond to the complete <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> , including the <termsem="SO:0001062"> prosegment </term> .
<termsem="SO:0001237"> Residues </term> forming the <termsem="SO:0100019"> active site </term> are shown in yellow on red background , other <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> identified as important for the stability of the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> are marked with yellow background , <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> identical in at least 5 of the structures are green , and <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> similar in their character are shown in magenta .
The maturation cleavage point generating the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N terminus </term> of the active <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> is marked with black triangles .
In addition to the mammals , CLN2-like <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> are also found in fugu ( puffer fish -- unannotated record SINFRUP00000077297 in the NCBI fugu <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> database , ) and zebrafish ( <termsem="SO:0000149"> contig </term> wz4596 .2 in the zebrafish <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> database , ) .
Only a <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of the latter <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> agreed with the former .
However , a few comparatively minor <termsem="SO:0001059"> modifications </term> can bring the zebrafish <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> into good agreement with that of the fugu CLN2 .
These <termsem="SO:0001059"> modifications </term> include a <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> of a single <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> from a run of three , as well as three <termsem="SO:0000667"> insertions </term> of <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeated </term> <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> pairs </term> ( Figure 2 ) .
It must be stressed that these <termsem="SO:0001059"> modifications </term> are speculative and may lead to prediction of several incorrect <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> ; however , they bring the two <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> into good global agreement ( 69 % identities and 83 % similarities ) .
Corrected <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene sequence </term> of the zebrafish CLN2.This putative <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> shows the manual corrections that bring it into alignment with the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of the fugu <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000046"> Inserted </term> <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotides </term> are marked in green and a <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> one in red .
The available <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequence </term> of the fugu CLN2 analog , named by us sedolisin-TPP [ 8 ] , is also in good agreement with the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of the mammalian <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologs </term> ( Figure 3 ) .
The only major difference in the translated <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequence </term> compared to the mammalian and zebrafish <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> is in the <termsem="SO:0100014"> amino terminus </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001062"> propeptide region </term> that is shorter by 30 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> ( not shown ) .
It is very likely that this represents a fault in the <termsem="SO:0000353"> assembled sequence </term> rather than a real <termsem="SO:0001059"> variation </term> , since the current <termsem="SO:0000717"> coding frame </term> is not initiated with a <termsem="SO:0001442"> methionine </term> , and a few extra <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> are present in the full <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic sequence </term> available from the fugu sequencing consortium .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequences </term> of the catalytic <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> of CLN2 .

CLN2 is present not only in fish , but also in amphibians , in particular in Xenopus tropicalis ( a species of frog ) .
A <termsem="SO:0000731"> partial </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of its sedolisin-TPP ( AL594774 ) found in the <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> database spans the middle part of the catalytic <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , without reaching the part of the <termsem="SO:0100019"> active site </term> closer to the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N terminus </term> that contains the aspartic and <termsem="SO:0001454"> glutamic acids </term> that belong to the catalytic triad .
However , the sequenced <termsem="SO:0000001"> part </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> shows 75 % identity with the fugu sedolisin-TPP , and 69 % identity with human CLN2 ( Figure 3 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> similarity to bacterial or fungal sedolisins is much lower , indicating that the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> found in frogs might also share the functional properties of the CLN2 subfamily .
The discovery of highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> CLN2-like <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> not only in mammals but also in two fish species and one of frogs may indicate that these peptidases are universally present in the vertebrates , and that their important role identified in humans [ 2 ] and mice [ 14 ] might be a more general feature .
Modeling of the structure of human CLN2 .
The medical importance of CLN2 and the lack of a crystal structure inspired attempts at protein modeling .
The first such model assumed that this <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> is membrane-bound , with the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> 271 -- 294 ( numbering corresponding to the mature <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> , Figure 1 ) forming the putative transmembrane anchor [ 15 ] .
However , in view of the subsequently obtained structures of the fully water-soluble sedolisins , this model was clearly incorrect .
Exploiting the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity between CLN2 , sedolisin , and kumamolisin ( Figure 4 ) , we have now used the <termsem="SO:0000312"> experimentally obtained </term> structures of the latter two <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> to form a new , <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> - derived model of human CLN2 .
The primary basis of the <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> model was the structure of a complex of sedolisin with a covalently-bound inhibitor , pseudo-iodotyrostatin .
Although it has not been directly shown that this compound can inhibit human CLN2 , other similar <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptides </term> with an aldehyde functionality on their '' <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-termini </term> '' are weak , but detectable , inhibitors of this <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> ( Oda , unpublished ) .
It is thus likely that pseudo-iodotyrostatin or a similar inhibitor might work for CLN2 as well , although the actual contacts between the inhibitor and the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> that are seen in the model have to be treated with caution .
Another reason for the modeling of a pseudo-iodotyrostatin complex is that CLN2 is a tripeptidase , and that this inhibitor it represents the only experimental structure of a tripeptide analog bound to sedolisin .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> alignment of bacterial and mammalian <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> .

The colors scheme is the same as in Figure 2 .
The r.m.s. deviation between the corresponding C coordinates of the model of CLN2 ( Figure 5 ) and the experimental structure of sedolisin is about 1.75  , not much larger than the experimental difference between sedolisin and kumamolisin .
Interestingly , the Cys327 and Cys342 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> in the model were found to be ideally positioned to form a disulfide bond even though this was not part of the design strategy .
That this bond likely occurs in the real protein is suggested by the fact that these two <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteines </term> are strictly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> in all known animal species of CLN2 ( Figures 1 and 3 ) , although they are absent in all <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of bacterial sedolisins .
Thus , if this disulfide were experimentally found to exist in CLN2 it would provide support for the correctness of the model .

Comparisons of the substrate binding pockets of CLN2 and sedolisin .
Since the principal known activity of CLN2 is that of a tripeptidase , it is expected that three substrate-binding pockets , S1 through S3 ( using the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [ 16 ] ) , should be discernible .
<termsem="SO:0001237"> Residues </term> P1-P3 of the inhibitor that should occupy these pockets are shown in Figure 6 .
All the available structures of the complexes of either sedolisin or kumamolisin with inhibitors contain either a <termsem="SO:0001446"> tyrosine </term> or a <termsem="SO:0001441"> phenylalanine </term> occupying the S1 pocket .
Parts of this pocket are fully <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> among different sedolisins , whereas other parts of it differ .
The right-hand side of the pocket ( in the view used in Figure 6 ) is made of the main <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain </term> including <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> 164 -- 165 ( unless otherwise indicated , the numbering refers to the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of the mature human CLN2 ) .
This part of the main <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain </term> is held in place through a hydrogen-bonded interaction with the side chain of Thr279 , part of the signature <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> SGTSAS surrounding the catalytic Ser280 and its equivalents in the other <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> .
Asp165 itself is also <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> since that <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> provides the lining of the oxyanion hole , so it can be safely assumed that this part of the S1 pocket is virtually identical .
No side chains point into the pocket from there , though , so its importance is limited to providing a steric barrier and excluding solvent .
Another wall of the pocket is made up of the main <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain of <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> </term> 130 -- 132 that flank the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> Gly131 .
Again , this part of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain </term> does not provide any specific interactions with the P1 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> of the substrate .
A model of the <termsem="SO:0100019"> active site </term> of human CLN2 .
The <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> is shown in complex with pseudo-iodotyrostatin , a good inhibitor of the sedolisin family of peptidases .
Only selected <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> are explicitly shown on the background consisting of the molecular surface .
The stick model of the inhibitor is colored gold and the P1-P3 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> are labeled in black .
Similar views have been previously published for the <termsem="SO:0000312"> experimentally-determined </term> structures of sedolisin and kumamolisin [ 8 ] .
The figure was prepared using the program DINO .
Considerable differences are seen , however , at the bottom of the pocket , where the side chains of Asp179 in kumamolisin and the equivalent Ser190 in sedolisin make hydrogen bonds to the P1 <termsem="SO:0001446"> tyrosine </term> of the inhibitor ( if present ) .
The equivalent <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> in CLN2 is Thr182 , but it is very unlikely that it can assume an orientation that would allow it to make a hydrogen bond to a P1 <termsem="SO:0001446"> tyrosine </term> .
Other polar <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> in the vicinity are Glu175 in sedolisin and the corresponding Asp169 in kumamolisin .
However , the <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> found here in CLN2 is Cys170 , much less polar than its <termsem="SO:0000853"> counterparts </term> .
There is also no equivalent to the polar interaction between Glu175 and Glu171 in sedolisin , since the equivalent of the latter <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> in CLN2 is Ser166 , much smaller and pointing away .
The side of the S1 pocket that is created by the very flexible side chain of Arg179 in sedolisin contains only a much smaller Ser174 in CLN2 , and thus is much more open in the latter protein .
This part of the pocket , with the main <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain </term> of the protein quite distant from the substrate , is indeed not well <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> in these proteins , with kumamolisin missing it entirely due to a <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> in the corresponding <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> position .
In summary , the S1 pocket in CLN2 has less polar character than the equivalent pocket in the related proteins , and is lacking direct polar anchors for any side chains that might be present in the substrate .
The S2 pocket in CLN2 is also quite open and accessible to solvent .
It is most likely larger than the equivalent pockets in either sedolisin or kumamolisin , since these are limited by Trp81 in the former and Trp129 in the latter ( these <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> originate from different parts of the backbone in the two <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> and are not topologically related ) .
Tyr130 , an equivalent of the latter <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> in CLN2 , is unlikely to come into direct contact with the P2 <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> of the substrate due to its greater distance ( almost 4  for the closest atoms ) .
An important remaining puzzle is that the <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> structure of CLN2 does not show any clear limitations of the S3 pocket that could explain the tripeptidase activity of this <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> .
The location of the P3 side chain of the substrate is ambiguous , since it could point in either one of two directions by exchange with the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> amine .
The only negatively charged <termsem="SO:0001237"> residue </term> of CLN2 that is found in this vicinity is Asp132 .
Although in the current model the distance between its carboxylate and the nitrogen of the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminus </term> of the modeled substrate is about 6  , these two groups could be brought into hydrogen-bonding range by some allowed changes in the torsion angles of the protein .
Such a conformational change would involve breaking of the hydrogen bond between Asp132 and Ser139 .
However , this latter interaction is not likely to be structurally crucial since the <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> is not absolutely <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> in all CLN2-like <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> .
Location of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> implicated in disease .
Location of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> found through a <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> survey of families of classic late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis patients has been described previously [ 17 ] .
Most such <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> result in expression of either truncated <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> or in incorrect <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> - <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> splices .
However , some of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> lead to single <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitutions </term> in the mature <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> .
Such <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> include I92N , E148K , C170R and C170Y , V190D , G194E , Q227H , R252H , A259E , and S280L ( Figure 5 ) .
Only the role of the latter <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> is completely clear , since it <termsem="SO:1000002"> replaces </term> the catalytic <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> of CLN2 with a side chain that can not support its <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymatic </term> activity .
No other <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> appear to be located in the immediate vicinity of the substrate .
<termsem="SO:0001237"> Residues </term> Val190 , Gly194 , and Arg252 are very highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> not only in CLN2 but also in other sedolisins and must play an important structural role .
The reasons why the remaining <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> would lead to the loss of <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymatic </term> activity are much less clear , but the wide distribution of these <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in the structure supports the conclusion that any <termsem="SO:0001059"> modifications </term> to CLN2 that would abolish or impair its function could lead to the development of the disease .
Substrates and inhibitors of CLN2 .
Little is known at this time about biologically-relevant substrates of CLN2 .
Various defects that include truncations and <termsem="SO:1000008"> single-site mutations </term> in CLN2 have been found in the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of patients that display symptoms of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis [ 17 ] .
One of the symptoms of the disease is the accumulation of an autofluorescent material , ceroid-lipofuscin , in lysosomal storage bodies in various cell types , primarily in the nervous system .
Since a major component of such bodies appears to be intact subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase , this protein has been implicated as a potential biological target of the protease .
It has been shown recently that CLN2 can indeed degrade this subunit on its <termsem="SO:0100014"> N terminus </term> [ 18 ] , but the unambiguous proof that this is indeed the most important target is still lacking .
CLN2 is capable of processing a number of different angiotensin-derived <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptides </term> [ 19 ] , with the efficiency of cleavage dependent on the length of such <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptides </term> .
The most efficiently processed <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> consisted of 14 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , with the tripeptide <termsem="SO:0001453"> Asp </term> - <termsem="SO:0001451"> Arg </term> - <termsem="SO:0001436"> Val </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> removed </term> from its <termsem="SO:0100014"> N terminus </term> .
The model of CLN2 presented here can easily accommodate this <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> on the P side of the substrate - <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding site </term> , although the exact mode of binding of the long P ' portion of the substrate remains obscure .
The observation that an analogous <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> acetylated on its <termsem="SO:0100014"> N terminus </term> can not be processed supports the postulate that the interactions of the <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal </term> amino group with the side chain of Asp132 may be the most important feature defining the tripeptidase specificity of CLN2 .
A number of different tripeptides can be serially processed from glucagon , with their <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> varying widely [ 20 ] .
Again , however , all of these tripeptides can be easily accommodated in the substrate - <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding site </term> of the CLN2 model .
Other potentially biologically relevant substrates include cholecystokinin and possibly other neuropeptides [ 21 ] .
An intriguing property of CLN2 is its reported ability to cleave collagen-related <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptides </term> [ 22 ] .
The tripeptides resulting from such processing include <termsem="SO:0001443"> Gly </term> - <termsem="SO:0001439"> Pro </term> - <termsem="SO:0001442"> Met </term> , <termsem="SO:0001443"> Gly </term> - <termsem="SO:0001439"> Pro </term> - <termsem="SO:0001451"> Arg </term> , and <termsem="SO:0001443"> Gly </term> - <termsem="SO:0001439"> Pro </term> - <termsem="SO:0001435"> Ala </term> .
It has been recently reported that kumamolisin , and particularly a closely related protein from Alicyclobacillus sendaiensis ( kumamolisin-As ) can efficiently cleave not only collagen-related <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptides </term> , but also <termsem="SO:0000782"> native </term> type I collagen [ 23 ] .
With the substrate - <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding site </term> of CLN2 resembling that of kumamolisin more than sedolisin ( the latter <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> has low , if any , collagenase activity ) , the potential collagen-processing role of CLN2 might warrant further investigation .
Since the catalytic machinery of CLN2 matches closely that of sedolisin , kumamolisin , and other members of the family of <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> - carboxyl peptidases , the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymatic </term> mechanism of all these <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> is most likely the same .
Design of inhibitors specific for CLN2 should incorporate the <termsem="SO:0000110"> features </term> that have been proven to be important for the related <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> , such as the placement of an aldehyde functionality capable of making covalent interactions with the catalytic <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> , or the utilization of chloromethyl ketone for the same purpose .
Since the few inhibitors that have been successfully used in the studies of sedolisins are either longer than tripeptides or contain blocking groups on their <termsem="SO:0100014"> N termini </term> , new tripeptide-based inhibitors with free <termsem="SO:0100014"> N termini </term> are now being synthesized ( Oda , unpublished ) .
It will be necessary to test the binding properties of different substrates in order to determine the most promising <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide sequences </term> .
Analysis of the model of CLN2 suggests that the size of the S1 subsite is much larger than in either sedolisin or kumamolisin , and thus the use of a large P1 group might be indicated .
Of course , the availability of an experimental crystal structure will make the design of inhibitors easier and we are continuing our efforts to crystallize CLN2 from different sources .
Three-dimensional , atomic-scale models of CLN2 were developed by exploiting the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity to the sedolisin and kumamolisin proteins ( r.m.s. deviation of 1.0  for 273 pairs of C atoms in the core of the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> ) .
Presently , these two <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> are the only members of the newly-defined sedolisin / <termsem="SO:0001444"> serine </term> - carboxyl peptidase family [ 8 ] for which the crystal structures have been published [ 5-7 ] .
The actual Protein Data Bank [ 24 ] : ) entries used in the modeling were 1GA4 .
pdb and 1GT9 .
pdb for sedolisin and kumamolisin , respectively .
The first step was to form a global , multiple <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignment between all <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> members of the sedolisin family .
Studies have shown that incorporating the specific patterns of <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid residue </term> - type variation and <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> among a family of <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> proteins provides superior results over simple , pair-wise <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignment [ 25 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> files representing the different subfamilies were extracted from the non-redundant GenBank database [ 26 ] using sedolisin , kumamolisin , and the human CLN2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> as queries to the web-based version of the BLAST program [ 27 ] : .
Initial multiple <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> alignments were formed with the ClustalX computer program [ 28 ] .
As is expected for a family of proteins , highly - <termsem="SO:0000330"> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> segments </term> were found aligned to the crystal structure-identified core <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of the sedolisin and kumamolisin <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
Subsequently , the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> were divided into two groups : those closer to sedolisin than kumamolisin and vise-a-versa .
The alignment of these two groups was then manually set by the observed structural alignment of the sedolisin and kumamolisin proteins .
Finally , some additional adjustment was required to correct the few places where highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> of the core <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> were slightly out of alignment among different subfamilies of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
The model of human CLN2 was built using the structure of sedolisin complexed with the inhibitor pseudo-tyrostatin [ 5,6 ] as a template .
The reason for this choice is that while different protein models were generally comparable , the chosen inhibitor was most compatible with the tripeptidase character of CLN2 .
With the correspondence of <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> specified in the alignments , atomic coordinates were transferred to the target <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> by a variety of methods , including the <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> modeling modules of the Look/GeneMine [ 29 ] and DeepView [ 30 ] computer program packages .
For the core and active site of the protein , coordinates for identical <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> were simply transferred unchanged ; whereas , special care was required to position the side chains of <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> differing from the template .
This was first accomplished automatically by the two computer packages , then manually adjusted in the Quanta molecular modeling package ( Accelrys , Inc. ) to better mimic the templates and optimize the interactions with surrounding <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> .
A similar two-step approach was used to manifest the <termsem="SO:0000667"> insertions </term> and <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletions </term> in the variable , loop <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of the protein , where it was necessary to create new backbone as well as side chain coordinates for the models .
It should be noted that , for obvious reasons , the conformation of poorly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> loop regions is generally the least accurate aspect of a <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> model .
Fortunately , these problematic loops will not significantly affect the <termsem="SO:0100019"> active site </term> of the model , since only two of them impinge on the <termsem="SO:0000699"> boundary </term> of this highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> , functional region .
Refinement and analysis of the model .
The model was finished by performing energy minimization in vacuo with the computer program CHARMM [ 31 ] .
This refined the structure by bringing the covalent geometry and non-bonded interactions into agreement with experimentally observed and calculated values .
Such optimizations included adjusting bond lengths , 3-point angles and 4-point dihedral angles , as well as eliminating atomic overlap and forming salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds .
Since presently the potential energy functions used to describe the atomic-scale models are not sufficiently comprehensive and accurate , the final energy of the model was not used as an indicator of the realistic quality of the structure .
The final quality of the structure was analyzed with the computer program PROCHECK [ 32 ] .
The structure was deposited at the PDB under accession code 1R60 .
