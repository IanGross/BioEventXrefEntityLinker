Fgf9 and Wnt4 Act as Antagonistic Signals to <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulate </term> Mammalian <termsem="GO:0007530"> Sex Determination </term> .
The genes encoding members of the wingless-related MMTV integration site ( WNT ) and fibroblast <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> ( FGF ) families coordinate <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> , <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in many fields of cells during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
In the mouse , Fgf9 and Wnt4 are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in gonads of both sexes prior to <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> .
Loss of Fgf9 leads to XY sex reversal , whereas loss of Wnt4 results in partial testis <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in XX gonads .
However , the relationship between these signals and the <termsem="GO:0030238"> male sex-determining </term> gene , Sry , was unknown .
We show through gain - and loss-of-function experiments that fibroblast <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> 9 ( FGF9 ) and WNT4 act as opposing signals to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> .
In the mouse XY gonad , Sry normally initiates a feed-forward loop between Sox9 and Fgf9 , which <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulates </term> Fgf9 and <termsem="GO:0048519"> represses </term> Wnt4 to establish the testis pathway .
Surprisingly , loss of Wnt4 in XX gonads is sufficient to <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulate </term> Fgf9 and Sox9 in the absence of Sry .
These data suggest that the fate of the gonad is <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> by antagonism between Fgf9 and Wnt4 .
The role of the <termsem="GO:0030238"> male sex-determining </term> switch -- Sry in the case of mammals -- is to tip the balance between these underlying <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> signals .
In principle , <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> in other vertebrates may operate through any switch that introduces an imbalance between these two <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> .
The development of sexually dimorphic <termsem="GO:0000003"> reproductive </term> organs is a common feature among animal species .
The testis and ovary represent two divergent <termsem="GO:0032502"> pathways of development </term> from the bipotential embryonic gonad .
The switch that initiates divergent development of the gonad is highly diverse among species ; however , the underlying mechanisms that lead to the establishment of ovary or testis pathways are likely to be conserved .
In all species , the embryonic gonad is made up of a mixed population of germ cells and somatic cells .
This tissue is remarkable in that all of its cells are believed to be bipotential , and can <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> into ovarian or testicular lineages [ 1,2 ] .
Consistent with the idea that cells in this primordium are poised between two <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental pathways </term> , some of the genes that are involved in <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishing </term> sexual dimorphism , including Dax1 ( dosage-sensitive sex reversal-congenital adrenal hypoplasia critical region on the X chromosome protein 1 ) , Sox9 ( Sry-like HMG box 9 ) , Fgf9 ( fibroblast <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> 9 ) , and Wnt4 ( wingless-related MMTV integration site 4 ) , are initially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in similar patterns in XX and XY gonads [ 3 -- 8 ] .
The conventional view of mammalian <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> is that the basic <termsem="GO:0048513"> pathway of organ development </term> is ovarian , and that the testis - <termsem="GO:0007530"> determining </term> gene operates by diverting this program toward testis <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> by simultaneously influencing the fate of the key supporting cell lineage and initiating a male-specific <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> program .
All of the experimental evidence suggests that these two processes are closely interwoven .
For example , both proliferation [ 9 ] and <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration of cells </term> to trigger testis cord <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> [ 10,11 ] appear to be closely integrated with Sertoli <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> .
Sry , a Y chromosome-linked gene , is the <termsem="GO:0007538"> primary sex-determining </term> gene in mammals [ 12 -- 14 ] .
In the absence of Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> -- in XX embryos , or in XY embryos carrying a deletion of Sry -- cells in the gonad follow an ovarian <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation pathway </term> .
Genetic evidence from chimeric mice [ 15 ] , and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> studies using reporter transgenes [ 2,16 ] , indicate that Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is required only in precursors of the somatic supporting cell lineage .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Sry in these bipotential cells leads to their differentiation as testis-specific Sertoli cells rather than as follicle cells , the parallel cell type of the ovary [ 2 ] .
It is believed that the Sertoli cell is the first cell type to <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> in the gonad [ 17 ] .
There is substantial evidence that a critical threshold number of Sertoli cells is required to establish testis <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 9,15,18 -- 20 ] .
In cases where this threshold is not reached , ovary <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ensues .
Once Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> begins , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns of other genes in the gonad begin to diverge .
The first gene downstream of Sry known to show male-specific <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> in Sertoli cell precursors is a related gene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in many tissues in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> embryo , Sox9 .
Disruption of Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the XY gonad causes male-to-female sex reversal [ 21,22 ] , whereas increasing the dose of Sox9 in the XX gonad leads to testis <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 23 -- 25 ] .
These studies indicate that Sox9 plays a central role in <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> .
Unlike Sry , which is specific to mammals , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sox9 is known to be conserved in the gonad of many species .
In mammals , Sox9 is <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> immediately after Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> initiates .
Experiments tracing Sry - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> cells using a stable reporter demonstrated that once testis <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is established , all Sertoli cells that <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Sox9 are descendants of cells that have <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> Sry [ 16 ] , suggesting that activation of Sox9 is a cell-autonomous effect of Sry .
However , mutations in several <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> including Fgf9 and Igf1r/Irr / <termsem="GO:0005009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Ir </term> </term> ( insulin-like <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> 1 receptor / <termsem="GO:0005009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> insulin receptor </term> </term> - related <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> / <termsem="GO:0005009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> insulin receptor </term> </term> ) resulted in loss of Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and partial or complete sex reversal [ 26,27 ] , suggesting that extracellular <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> play a significant role during <termsem="GO:0007538"> primary sex determination </term> .
Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Fgf9 display male-to-female sex reversal caused by disruption of all testis-specific <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular events </term> , including <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> , mesonephric <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> , testis cord <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , and the differentiation of Sertoli cells [ 26,27 ] .
Fgf9 , like many of the founding signals in the gonads , is initially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in gonads of both sexes , but becomes male-specific after Sry is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> .
In a reciprocal manner , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt4 , which is also initially common to gonads of both sexes , becomes female-specific [ 8 ] .
XX gonads with a null mutation in Wnt4 display some obvious aspects of testicular <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 28 ] .
Based on the theory that Sertoli cells initiate all downstream testicular <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , this might imply that Sertoli <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> had been initiated in Wnt4  /  XX gonads .
However , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sertoli cell markers was not previously detected in these mutants during fetal stages [ 8,29 ] , leading to the conclusion that Wnt4 was not involved in <termsem="GO:0007538"> primary sex determination </term> in the gonad .
To integrate these findings , we investigated the genetic relationship of Sry , Sox9 , Fgf9 , and Wnt4 in the <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> network that <termsem="GO:0065007"> governs </term> the gonadal field .
We show that the loss of Fgf9 in homozygous mutant XY gonads does not affect the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of SRY or the initial <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of SOX9 ; however , SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is not maintained in the Fgf9  /  mutant gonads , and testis <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is aborted .
We also demonstrate that FGF9 <termsem="GO:0048519"> represses </term> the ovary - <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> gene , Wnt4 .
We hypothesize that FGF9 functions in a feed-forward loop to <termsem="GO:0008283"> expand </term> Sertoli precursor cells , which <termsem="GO:0046903"> secrete </term> FGF9 , to a critical threshold number sufficient to <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> Wnt4 .
This directly or indirectly stabilizes SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and secures the male fate of the gonad .
WNT4 seems to oppose the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> by <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressing </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of SOX9 and FGF9 .
Surprisingly , both <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> genes are transiently activated in Wnt4  /  XX gonads in the absence of the Y-linked gene Sry .
Based on this genetic and in vitro data , we suggest that the plasticity of the bipotential gonad is <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlled </term> by mutually antagonistic signals between FGF9 and WNT4 in the gonadal field .
These signals coordinate sexually dimorphic patterns of <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> , <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> cellular differentiation </term> .
Early Bipotential <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of FGF9 Resolves to an XY-Specific Pattern by 12.5 dpc .
Using an antibody specific to FGF9 , we examined <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> during normal <termsem="GO:0008406"> gonad development </term> .
FGF9 protein was <termsem="GO:0051179"> distributed </term> throughout the 11.5 dpc gonad in both sexes ( Figure 1A and 1B ) .
However , by 12.5 dpc , FGF9 was detected only in XY gonads in two domains : in cells near the surface of gonads and in cells located within testis cords .
This sex-specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern was maintained in gonads at 13.5 dpc ( Figure 1C -- 1F ) .
FGF9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> within testis cords was localized to Sertoli cells and excluded from germ cells based on the germ cell membrane marker platelet/endothelial <termsem="GO:0007155"> cell adhesion </term> molecule ( PECAM ) ( Figure 1D and 1F ) .
To confirm this result , we examined agametic gonads from KitW/Wv compound heterozygous embryos , which <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> testis cords containing Sertoli cells only .
FGF9 was detectable at normal levels in testis cords in XY KitW/Wv gonads , where <termsem="GO:0004035"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> alkaline phosphatase </term> </term> staining verified the absence of germ cells ( Figure 1G -- 1J ) , indicating that FGF9 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by Sertoli cells , and that its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is not dependent on the presence of germ cells .
In summary , FGF9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was present in both XX and XY gonads at bipotential stages , and became restricted to XY gonads as testis <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> proceeded .
Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> Is Normal in Homozygous Null Fgf9 XY Gonads .
The early <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Fgf9 in bipotential gonads raised the question of whether Fgf9 is an upstream regulator of Sry .
To investigate this possibility , we <termsem="GO:0007618"> mated </term> Fgf9 + /  mice with a transgenic reporter line that carries an enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) transgene <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by the Sry promoter Sry-EGFP .
At early stages , this transgene represents the pattern of endogenous Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 2 ] .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the EGFP reporter was detected in Fgf9  /  XY gonads comparable to Fgf9 + /  littermate controls ( Figure 2A and 2B ) , suggesting that <termsem="GO:0045449"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulation </term> of Sry is independent of Fgf9 .
Sex reversal is caused not only by the loss of normal levels of Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 30,31 ] , but also by mutations disrupting SRY import into the nucleus [ 32 ] .
The transgene , Sry-EGFP , does not reflect the <termsem="GO:0051641"> intracellular distribution </term> of the SRY protein .
To investigate this aspect of SRY <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> , we <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> Fgf9 + /  mice with another Sry reporter mouse line carrying a Myc-tagged Sry transgene , SryMyc , which recapitulates the endogenous intracellular SRY <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern [ 16 ] .
Using an antibody against c-MYC , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of SRYMYC in SryMyc ; Fgf9  /  gonads was indistinguishable from littermate controls ( Figure 2C and 2D ) .
These data using two different Sry transgenic reporter lines provide evidence that Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is not dependent on Fgf9 .
Therefore , Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> must act in parallel and/or downstream of Sry to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> testis <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
FGF9 Can <termsem="GO:0048518"> Up-Regulate </term> SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> .
In our previous study we did not observe SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at 12.5 dpc in Fgf9  /  XY gonads that fail to <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> into normal testes [ 26 ] .
However , the loss of SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at 12.5 dpc could be a consequence of the loss of Sertoli <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> rather than a reflection of the genetic interaction between FGF9 and SOX9 .
Normally , Sox9 is weakly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in wild-type genital ridges of both XX and XY embryos at 10.5 dpc and , after the onset of Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , is <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> in XY gonads [ 5,33,16 ] .
As results indicated that Fgf9 functioned downstream of , or in parallel with Sry , we investigated whether Fgf9 was involved in the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Primary cell culture and gonad culture systems were used to assess Sox9 activation by exogenous FGF9 .
For in vitro cell culture , cells were isolated from 11.5 dpc gonads free of mesonephroi , and cultured on extracellular matrix-coated coverslips with or without addition of purified FGF9 in culture media .
After culture for 24 h , SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was monitored by an antibody specific to SOX9 in XX cells and control XY cells .
Exogenous FGF9 increased cell number in XX and XY cell cultures compared with cells in a duplicate culture without FGF9 treatment ( unpublished data ) , and caused the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of SOX9 in XX cells ( Figure 2E -- 2H ) .
<termsem="GO:0048518"> Up-regulation </term> of SOX9 had not previously been seen in whole XX gonads cultured with exogenous FGF9 [ 9 ] .
To explain the difference between experimental results from dissociated XX gonadal cells and XX gonads , we reasoned that the local concentrations of FGF9 might not be high enough to override blocking signals in the intact XX gonad , or that active FGF9 was not efficiently <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> or presented in the extracellular matrix of the XX gonad .
To test the local effect of FGF9 , we modified the XX gonad culture by stably immobilizing FGF9 , or BSA as a control , on beads ( Figure 2I -- 2K ) .
Under these conditions , SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> locally in cells near the surface of the XX gonad in contact with the FGF9 bead ( Figure 2K ) .
Taken together , these in vitro data demonstrate that ectopic FGF9 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> can induce SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in XX gonadal cells , suggesting a positive interaction between Fgf9 and Sox9 .
Fgf9 Is Required for Maintaining SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> in XY Gonads .
To investigate whether Fgf9 is essential for the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of Sox9 in vivo , we assessed SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in loss-of-function Fgf9 + /  and Fgf9  /  XY gonads at 11.5 -- 12.5 dpc ( Figure 3A -- 3F ) .
In wild-type and heterozygous mutant XY gonads at 11.5 dpc , SOX9 was detected in a small number of cells in the gonad ( Figure 3A ) .
Over the next 6 h of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , nuclear SOX9 accumulated rapidly in cells toward the cortex and the anterior and posterior poles of the gonad , replicating patterns previously reported for both Sry and Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 2,16,34 -- 36 ] .
This unique pattern was also observed in Fgf9  /  XY gonads ( Figure 3D and 3E ) .
Somatic cells within Fgf9  /  gonads were positive for SOX9 at 11.5 dpc , the earliest stages examined , demonstrating that initial <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of SOX9 were not disrupted in Fgf9  /  mutant XY gonads prior to 12.0 dpc .
Notably , in Fgf9  /  XY gonads , SOX9 was no longer detectable by 12.5 dpc , and Sertoli precursor cells never began to <termsem="GO:0048532"> organize </term> into normal testis cord structures ( Figure 3F ) .
These data indicate that although Fgf9 is not required for the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of Sox9 in vivo , it is indispensable to maintain Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Sertoli precursor cells .
Sox9 Is Required for Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0048518"> Up-Regulation </term> in XY Gonads .
We hypothesized that if the linear relationship among the three genes were Sry  Fgf9  Sox9 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Fgf9 would be normal in XY gonads in the absence of Sox9 .
Alternatively , if the relationship were Sry  Sox9  Fgf9 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Fgf9 should be reduced or absent in XY gonads in the absence of Sox9 .
We examined Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Sox9 homozygous mutant ( Sox9/ ) XY gonads <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> by crossing mice homozygous for a conditional null ( flox ) allele of Sox9 ( Sox9flox/flox ) with mice carrying germline-specific Cre transgenes , Prm1-Cre in male and Zp3-Cre in female [ 22,37 ] .
The Sox9 null mutant embryos <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> after 11.5 dpc because of cardiovascular defects [ 37 ] .
Chaboissier et al. [ 22 ] successfully cultured 11.5 dpc Sox9 null mutant gonads in vitro and detected male and female markers after 2 -- 3 d of culture , suggesting that Sox9 mutant gonads are viable and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmentally </term> competent at 11.5 dpc -- the time point at which we collected samples to perform mRNA in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> ( Figure 3G -- 3J ) .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Fgf9 was significantly decreased or absent in XY Sox9/ gonads at 11.5 dpc ( Figure 3J ) , while Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was similar to wild-type ( Figure 3G and 3H ) , as previously reported [ 20 ] , suggesting that Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in wild-type XY gonads is dependent on the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sox9 .
These findings also indicate that <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sry is not sufficient to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> Fgf9 in the absence of Sox9 .
Therefore , we conclude that Sox9 is essential for Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , and Fgf9 , in return , maintains Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , generating a positive feed-forward loop between these two genes in XY gonads .
Like Fgf9 Mutant Gonads , Sox9/ XY Gonads Show Defects in <termsem="GO:0008283"> Cell Proliferation </term> .
We previously reported that XY-specific <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> is defective in Fgf9  /  XY gonads [ 7 ] .
Because Sox9 acts as a positive regulator of Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , we questioned whether <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> in XY gonads was also compromised by the loss of Sox9 .
We examined <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> in Sox9/ gonads at 11.5 dpc using a <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> cell marker , <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylated </term> histone H3 .
<termsem="GO:0008283"> Proliferating </term> cells were more abundant and concentrated in a domain near the surface of wild-type XY gonads , and this XY-specific <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> was evident in XY Sox9flox/ littermate controls ( Figure 3K ) .
However , in Sox9/ XY gonads <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> was reduced and similar to XX gonads ( Figure 3L -- 3O ) .
This result supports the idea that there is a mutual interdependence between Sox9 and Fgf9 generating a positive feed-forward loop , and that both genes are required for the expansion of somatic cells , including Sertoli cell precursors , in XY gonads .
The <termsem="GO:0046661"> Male Pathway </term> Is Aborted in Fgf9  /  Sertoli Precursors .
Based on the fact that Sox9 is initially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in Fgf9  /  gonads , we investigated whether other genes in the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> are activated .
We examined two markers for Sertoli <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> , anti-Mullerian <termsem="GO:0005179"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hormone </term> </term> ( Amh ) [ 38 ] and Desert hedgehog ( Dhh ) [ 39 ] in Fgf9  /  XY gonads using whole-mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
Dhh , which is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in XY wild-type and heterozygous gonads beginning at 11.5 dpc , was absent from Fgf9  /  XY gonads , although mesonephric <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was still detected ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Amh , which is a direct <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> target of SOX9 activated after 11.5 dpc [ 38,40 ] , was detected at reduced levels in Fgf9  /  XY gonads at 12.5 dpc ( Figure 4C -- 4F ) .
The residual level of Amh suggested that the transient <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of SOX9 in Fgf9  /  gonads at 11.5 dpc was sufficient to activate Amh , a direct downstream target .
However , the absence of Dhh indicated that not all Sertoli pathways are initiated .
The initial <termsem="GO:0001708"> specification </term> of Sertoli cell precursors was not affected by the loss of Fgf9 , as evidenced by normal Sry and Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Fgf9  /  gonads at 11.5 dpc ( Figures 2 and 3D ) .
However , SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in XY Fgf9  /  gonads rapidly disappeared ( Figure 3E and 3F ) , and other Sertoli markers were absent or severely reduced ( Figure 4A -- 4F ) .
To investigate the possibility that this loss was due to <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> , we immunostained XY Fgf9  /  gonads at 12.0 dpc -- a time point at which SOX9 - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> cells were declining in numbers ( Figure 3E ) -- for active <termsem="GO:0030693"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> caspase </term> </term> -3 , an <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cell marker .
<termsem="GO:0006915"> Apoptotic </term> cells were not observed in Fgf9  /  gonads or in littermate controls at 12.0 dpc , although Fgf9  /  samples showed somewhat increased <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> in mesonephric tubules and ducts , another site of Fgf9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 4G and 4H ) .
These data suggested that the loss of SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Fgf9  /  XY gonads was not caused by <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> but by the disruption of FGF9/SOX9 feed-forward <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> .
To determine whether the aborting of the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> in Fgf9  /  Sertoli precursors was associated with the transition of supporting cells from male to female <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , we investigated <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt4 , an ovary - <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> gene .
At 12.5 dpc Wnt4 was <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> in XY Fgf9  /  but not in XY Fgf9 + /  gonad controls ( Figure 4I -- 4K ) .
This result suggests that Fgf9 is necessary for the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of Wnt4 in <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> XY gonads at/after bipotential stages .
Fgf9 and Wnt4 Antagonize Each Other .
Our finding that high levels of Wnt4 persist in Fgf9  /  XY gonads implies a genetic antagonism specifically between Fgf9 and Wnt4 , as both SRY and SOX9 are initially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in Fgf9  /  XY gonads at 11.5 dpc , yet this is not sufficient to <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulate </term> Wnt4 .
To test whether exogenous FGF9 could <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt4 , we cultured the XX gonad/mesonephros complex with or without FGF9 protein , and examined Wnt4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> by whole-mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
Treatment of XX gonads with exogenous FGF9 <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> the normal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt4 ( Figure 5A -- 5C ) , supporting the hypothesis that Fgf9 , rather than Sry or Sox9 , functions to <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulate </term> Wnt4 in wild-type XY gonads .
We reasoned that if FGF9 and WNT4 do act as opposing signals , then reduction in the dose of Wnt4 might render the XX gonad more susceptible to the male - <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> effects of exogenous FGF9 .
To test this possibility , XX Wnt4 + /  and Wnt4 + / + gonads were cultured in medium with or without FGF9 , and were examined for SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 5D -- 5G ) .
We found that FGF9 induced SOX9 <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> in XX Wnt4 + /  gonads , but not in Wnt4 + / + XX gonads ( Figure 5F and 5G ) .
These results demonstrate antagonism between WNT4 and FGF9 under in vitro gain-of-function conditions .
To test antagonism between these factors under loss-of-function conditions in vivo , we investigated whether Fgf9 is derepressed in the absence of Wnt4 ( Figure 6A -- 6C ) .
Using an antibody against FGF9 , we found that FGF9 was <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in Wnt4  /  XX gonads but not in Wnt4 + /  XX controls ( Figure 6B and 6C ) .
This result suggested that FGF9 is normally <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> by WNT4 in XX gonads .
Given our finding that FGF9 , a positive regulator of Sox9 , is derepressed in XX Wnt4  /  gonads , we asked whether <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of SOX9 might also occur in XX Wnt4  /  gonads ( Figure 6D -- 6L ) .
An antibody against SOX9 revealed that <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was initially <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> in Wnt4  /  XX gonads at 11.5 dpc ( Figure 6F and 6I ) , although it was rapidly <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> by 12.0 dpc and absent at 12.5 dpc ( Figure 6I and 6L ) .
This finding was confirmed by mRNA in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> , which also detected Sox9 transcripts in 11.5 dpc Wnt4  /  XX gonads ( Figure S1 ) .
Wnt4  /  XX gonads do not increase in size comparable to normal XY gonads ( Figure 6C , 6F , 6I , and 6L ) , and Sertoli <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> and testis cord <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> do not occur .
Nevertheless , it is noteworthy that <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of SOX9 occurs in this case in the absence of Sry , by eliminating the antagonistic effect of Wnt4 and <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulating </term> FGF9 , supporting our hypothesis that <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> occurs by tipping the balance between these two opposing signals .
Many studies support the view that cells in the undifferentiated gonad are bipotential ; the supporting cell precursor lineage can <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> into follicle cells or Sertoli cells .
In Fgf9  /  XY gonads , cells initially embark on the Sertoli pathway , but in the absence of Fgf9 can neither maintain Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> nor establish downstream male pathways .
The loss of Sertoli cells in XY Fgf9  /  gonads is not due to <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> , but instead to a transition of supporting cell fate as SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is lost .
We suggest that in the absence of the antagonizing activity of FGF9 , WNT4 signals predominate and <termsem="GO:0065007"> govern </term> somatic cell fate in the gonadal field .
The Drosophila genital disk is also a field of cells that normally follows one of two sexually dimorphic fates .
For many years it was believed that the fate of each cell in the genital disk was under the cell-autonomous <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of double sex ( dsx ) , the key regulator of the <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination pathway </term> .
However , mosaic studies have shown that the genetic sex of the cells in the anterior/posterior organizers of the disk , not the sex of the majority of cells in the disk , <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> the sexually dimorphic fate of the disk .
This occurs through the sex-specific regulation of WNT , FGF , and <termsem="GO:0007179"> transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> beta signaling </term> , which in turn <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> , <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> , and <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> of the disk [ 41,42 ] .
Sex-specific <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of <termsem="GO:0008406"> gonad organogenesis </term> in vertebrates may occur in a similar manner , where some cells are cell-autonomously <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> to the <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex-determining </term> switch ; however , the establishment of the male or <termsem="GO:0046660"> female program </term> occurs through the non-cell-autonomous activity of classic <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> that act in an antagonistic manner and coordinate <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> , <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> and <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> in the gonad .
The interplay between cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous pathways in the mammalian gonad is not well understood .
In XX  XY chimera experiments , XX cells can be recruited to the Sertoli lineage , indicating that non-cell-autonomous <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling mechanisms </term> operate under these conditions [ 15 ] .
Other more recent studies have suggested that paracrine signals could be involved in the <termsem="GO:0060009"> establishment of Sertoli cells </term> [ 43 -- 46 ] .
The current study reveals that ectopic FGF9 can induce SOX9 under conditions in which XX cells are dissociated ( Figure 2F ) , when an FGF9-coated bead is directly applied to the XX gonad ( Figure 2K ) , or when the dose of Wnt4 is reduced ( Figure 5G ) .
Whether FGF9 normally acts non-cell-autonomously in vivo to recruit XY cells to the Sertoli lineage by <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulating </term> SOX9 is not clear .
We show that Sry can initially <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulate </term> SOX9 in the absence of Fgf9 , suggesting that FGF9 is not necessary for this step .
However , FGF9 may act to trigger <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> , increasing the number of Sertoli precursors above a threshold needed to stabilize the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> , consistent with threshold requirements deduced from earlier studies using XX  XY chimeric gonads [ 15 ] .
Since Sertoli cells <termsem="GO:0009058"> produce </term> FGF9 , loss of <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> of Sertoli precursors may result in a reduction of the overall level of FGF9 , and/or other male paracrine signals , below a critical threshold level required to antagonize the influence of WNT4 .
This model is appealing , because it links <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> , believed to be required for establishment of the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> [ 9 ] , with Sertoli <termsem="GO:0001709"> fate determination </term> .
A recent study by Yoshioka et al. [ 47 ] showed that misexpression of Fgf9 in chick nephrogenous mesenchyme led to the expansion of gonadal marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , implicating Fgf9 in gonadal <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> across species .
It has been suggested that SOX9 <termsem="GO:0048519"> represses </term> WNT4 based on misexpression studies [ 48 ] .
Here we show that the addition of FGF9 protein to XX gonad explant cultures <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressed </term> the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt4 .
<termsem="GO:0048519"> Down-regulation </term> of Wnt4 is unlikely to occur through SOX9 , as SOX9 is not <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> in this situation [ 7 ] .
Furthermore , although both SRY and SOX9 are initially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in Fgf9  /  XY gonads , Wnt4 is not <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> in the absence of Fgf9 ( Figure 4K ) .
These findings support the idea that FGF9 acts as the antagonist of Wnt4 .
Antagonism of WNT signals may be a multistep process involving both the <termsem="GO:0016481"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> down-regulation </term> of Wnt4 observed in this study and the destabilization of downstream Wnt intracellular pathways that antagonize SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , as shown in chondrocyte <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 49 ] , or that compete for intracellular <termsem="GO:0004871"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> signal transducers </term> </term> as has been reported in other systems [ 50,51 ] .
Future work will address these possibilities .
In support of the idea that Wnt4 antagonizes the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> , we found that the loss of Wnt4 caused the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of both SOX9 and FGF9 in XX gonads where Sry is absent .
It appears that the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> can be initiated by disrupting the balance between Wnt4 and Fgf9 , a finding that has strong implications for other vertebrate <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex-determination </term> systems in which Sry is not the <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determining </term> factor .
However , <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of Sox9 is not sufficient to establish testis <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in this mutant , as occurs in Odsex and other gain-of-function mutants where Sox9 is misexpressed in the XX gonad [ 24,25 ] .
In those two misexpression cases , Sox9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> may have been artificially sustained by exogenous <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> sequences that bypass the fine dosage balance in this <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> network .
In Wnt4 mutants , SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is not maintained .
In light of the observation that the Wnt4  /  XX gonad does not increase significantly in size ( Figure 6 ) , it is possible that the FGF9/SOX9 - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> population did not reach a critical threshold .
Alternatively ( or in addition ) , another male-specific factor normally dependent on Sry may be required to sustain SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , possibly <termsem="GO:0017134"> FGF-binding </term> proteins in the extracellular matrix or <termsem="GO:0005007"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> FGF receptors </term> </term> .
It is equally plausible that there are other female-specific factors that antagonize the establishment of SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
It has been observed that several other WNTs are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the XX gonad [ 52 ] , and these or other factors may partially compensate for the loss of Wnt4 .
These findings suggest that WNT4 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> normally acts as a repressor of the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> by interfering with the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of SOX9 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
One report of a duplication of the region of human Chromosome 1 , which includes WNT4 , led to an intersex phenotype [ 53 ] .
However , the report constitutes only circumstantial evidence .
Such a role is not supported by efforts to misexpress Wnt4 in XY gonads , which have led to very mild phenotypes with no evidence for defects in Sertoli <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> [ 54 ] .
It is possible that WNT4 protein did not function as an active signal in these transgenic mice , either because it was not <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the right cells , at the right time , or at the right level .
Consistent with our data and the partially sex-reversed phenotype of Wnt4  /  XX mutants , other WNTs or additional female factors may be required .
The switch that <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> <termsem="GO:0007530"> sex determination </term> is biologically diverse .
Sry is not present in nonmammalian systems ; however , antagonistic <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> between FGFs and WNTs may be the conserved mechanism that balances the gonad between testicular and ovarian fates in vertebrates .
In theory , any genetic or environmental switch may tip the balance toward the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> .
Based on our findings we propose that cells in the mammalian gonad are balanced between two competing cell fates by counterbalanced <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> , Fgf9 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> near the coelomic surface , and Wnt4 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> near the mesonephric border ( Figure 7 ) .
In mammalian XY gonads , the onset of Sry <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> initiates the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> by <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulating </term> Sox9 .
SOX9 <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulates </term> Fgf9 , which initiates a Sox9/Fgf9 feed-forward loop that accelerates commitment to the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> .
In XX gonads or XY mutant gonads lacking Sry , Sox9 , or Fgf9 , the SOX9/FGF9 feed-forward loop is not established , and WNT4 gains <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the gonadal field .
This results in the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of Sox9 and Fgf9 , tilting the balance toward commitment to the <termsem="GO:0046660"> female pathway </term> .
Further experiments will be required to define the molecular mechanism of FGF9 and WNT4 action .
However , our in vivo and in vitro data strongly support the antagonistic relationship of these two <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the testis - <termsem="GO:0007530"> determining </term> factor SOX9 .

Opposing Signals <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0007530"> Sex Determination </term> in the Bipotential Gonad .
In both XX and XY gonads at 11.25 dpc ( 15 tail-somite stage ) , Fgf9 transcripts ( white arrows ) are detected near the gonad surface ( A and B ) , whereas Wnt4 transcripts are detected near the gonad mesonephric boundary ( C and D ) .
We propose a model in which the fate of the gonad is balanced between these competing signals .
A genetic or environmental switch initiates the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> by creating an imbalance between these signals .
In mammals , this imbalance occurs through the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of Sox9 .
Sox9 <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulates </term> Fgf9 , and Fgf9 maintains Sox9 , forming a positive feed-forward loop in XY gonads .
In this situation , the balance between FGF9 and WNT4 signals is shifted in favor of FGF9 , and the dominance of the <termsem="GO:0046661"> male pathway </term> is established .
In the absence of a feed-forward loop between SOX9 and FGF9 ( e.g. , in XX gonads ) , WNT4 blocks Fgf9 , initiating the <termsem="GO:0046660"> female pathway </term> .
