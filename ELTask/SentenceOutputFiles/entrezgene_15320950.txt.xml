Loss of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein expression abolishes endocochlear potential and causes deafness in Pendred syndrome mouse model .
Pendred syndrome , a common autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter , is caused by mutations of <termsem="EG:5172"> SLC26A4 </term> , which codes for <termsem="EG:5172"> pendrin </term> .
We investigated the relationship between <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> and deafness using mice that have ( <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + ) or lack a complete <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> gene ( <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - ) .
Expression of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> and other proteins was determined by confocal immunocytochemistry .
Expression of mRNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR .
The endocochlear potential and the endolymphatic K + concentration were measured with double-barreled microelectrodes .
Currents generated by the stria marginal cells were recorded with a vibrating probe .
Tissue masses were evaluated by morphometric distance measurements and pigmentation was quantified by densitometry .
<termsem="EG:23985"> Pendrin </term> was found in the cochlea in apical membranes of spiral prominence cells and spindle-shaped cells of stria vascularis , in outer sulcus and root cells .
Endolymph volume in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice was increased and tissue masses in areas normally occupied by type I and II fibrocytes were reduced .
<termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice lacked the endocochlear potential , which is generated across the basal cell barrier by the K + channel <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> localized in intermediate cells .
Stria vascularis was hyperpigmented , suggesting unalleviated free radical damage .
The basal cell barrier appeared intact ; intermediate cells and <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> mRNA were present but <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein was absent .
Endolymphatic K + concentrations were normal and membrane proteins necessary for K + secretion were present , including the K + channel <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> and <termsem="EG:16509"> KCNE1 </term> , Na + / 2Cl - / K + cotransporter <termsem="EG:20496"> SLC12A2 </term> and the gap junction <termsem="EG:14619"> GJB2 </term> .
These observations demonstrate that <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> dysfunction leads to a loss of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein expression and a loss of the endocochlear potential , which may be the direct cause of deafness in Pendred syndrome .
Pendred syndrome is a relatively common autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by deafness and goiter [ 1 ] .
The syndrome is caused by mutations of the <termsem="EG:5172"> PDS </term> gene <termsem="EG:5172"> SLC26A4 </term> , which codes for the protein <termsem="EG:5172"> pendrin </term> [ 2 ] .
Deafness is congenital and generally profound although sometimes late in onset and provoked by light head injury .
Vestibular dysfunction is uncommon .
Goiter is variable and generally develops around puberty [ 3 ] .
The cause of goiter appears to be an impairment of iodide fixation in the follicular lumen due to a reduced rate of iodide transport across the apical membrane of thyroid gland epithelial cells [ 4 ] .
A positive perchlorate discharge test and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct appear to be the most reliable clinical signs of Pendred syndrome [ 5 ] .
Pendrin is an anion exchanger that can transport Cl - , I - , HCO3 - and formate [ 6,7 ] .
Expression has been found in the inner ear and thyroid gland consistent with the clinical signs of deafness and goiter [ 2,3,8 ] .
In addition , pendrin expression has been found in the kidney [ 9 ] , mammary gland [ 10 ] , uterus [ 11 ] , testes [ 12 ] and placenta [ 13 ] .
No expression was found in fetal or adult brain , consistent with a peripheral cause of deafness [ 2,11 ] .
Expression of pendrin mRNA in the inner ear has been found in several places including the cochlea , the vestibular labyrinth and the endolymphatic sac [ 8 ] .
The precise location of pendrin protein expression , however , has not yet been determined .
The variability of deafness in Pendred syndrome and the observation that deafness is sometimes late in onset suggest that <termsem="EG:5172"> pendrin </term> dysfunction may not be the direct cause of deafness .
It is conceivable that <termsem="EG:5172"> pendrin </term> dysfunction favors changes in the expression levels of proteins that are critical for the maintenance of the hearing function .
Detailed studies aimed at identifying the direct cause of deafness in Pendred syndrome have recently become possible due to the generation of a pendrin-specific polyclonal antibody [ 9 ] and the development of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice , which bear a targeted disruption of the <termsem="EG:23985"> mouse Slc26a4 </term> gene [ 14 ] .
The aim in the present study was to determine the location of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> and the cause of deafness in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice .
The endocochlear potential and the endolymphatic and perilymphatic K + concentrations were measured in young adult mice ( 1 -- 4 month of age ) that either have ( <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + ) or lack ( <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - ) a functional gene for <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> [ 14 ] .
The mouse strain 129Sv/Ev ( Taconic , Germantown , NY ) was chosen as the source of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + controls , since <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice were propagated in the this strain and generated using a stem cell line derived from 129Sv/Ev .
<termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - were agouti .
They did not differ in coat color .
Differences in pigmentation were verified using coisogenic age-matched <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - that were bred in parallel .
Expression of key proteins involved in the generation of the endocochlear potential and the transport of K + was studied using confocal immunocytochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR .
K + secretion and the generation of the endocochlear potential were measured using electrophysiological techniques .
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kansas State University .
Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital ( 100 mg/kg i.p. ) and transcardially perfused with a Cl -- free phosphate-buffered Na-gluconate solution containing 4 % paraformaldehyde .
Temporal bones were removed and cochleae fixed by perilymphatic perfusion , decalcified in EDTA , processed through a sucrose gradient and infiltrated with polyethylene glycol .
Mid-modiolar cryosections ( 12 m , CM3050S , Leica , Nussloch , Germany ) were blocked in PBS with 0.2 % Triton-X ( PBS-TX ) and 10 % <termsem="EG:280717"> bovine serum albumin </term> .
Slides were incubated overnight at 4 C with primary antibodies in PBS-TX with 1 -- 3 % <termsem="EG:280717"> BSA </term> [ rabbit anti-pendrin , 1:500 ( h766 -- 780 ) ; rat anti-ZO-1 , 1:100 ( Chemicon , Temecula , CA ) ; goat anti-KCNQ1 , 1:200 ( C20 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , rabbit anti-KCNE1 , 1:200 ( Alomone , Jerusalem , Israel ) ; rabbit anti-KCNJ10 , 1:300 ( Alomone ) ; rabbit anti-SLC12A2 , 1:100 ( Chemicon ) ; and rabbit anti-connexin 26 , 1:100 ( Zymed , San Francisco , CA ) ] .
Slides were washed in PBS-TX and incubated for 1 h at 25 C with appropriate secondary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS-TX with 1 -- 3 % BSA [ donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 , chicken anti-rat Alexa 594 , and chicken anti-goat Alexa 594 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) ] .
Actin filaments were visualized by staining with Alexa 488 conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) .
After incubation , slides were washed with PBS-TX , mounted with FluorSave ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) , and viewed by confocal microscopy ( LSM 5 Pascal or LSM 510 Meta , Carl Zeiss , Jena or Gttingen , Germany ) .
Laser scanning brightfield images were collected to document structural preservation , for morphometric analysis and for analysis of pigmentation .
Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital ( 100 mg/kg i.p. ) .
Kidneys and brain were removed and pulverized in liquid N2 .
Temporal bones were removed and two preparations of inner ear tissues were obtained by microdissection : ( 1 ) stria vascularis without spiral ligament , and ( 2 ) spiral ganglia including the surrounding bone and the organ of Corti .
The dissection medium was changed twice during the microdissection and isolated tissues were washed three times to minimize cross-contamination .
The <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - genotype was verified by the observation of large otoconia in the utricular macula [ 14 ] .
Total RNA was isolated and residual DNA contamination was removed by enzymatic digestion ( RNeasy micro , Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) .
Quality and quantity of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> obtained from kidneys and brain were determined ( Nano Assay , 2100 Bioanalyzer , Agilent , Palo Alto , CA ) .
Further , the quality of RNA preparations obtained from stria vascularis and spiral ganglia was assessed ( Pico Assay , 2100 Bioanalyzer ) .
Real time RT-PCR was performed on RNA obtained from individual animals ( OneStep RT-PCR , Qiagen ; Smart Cycler , Cepheid , Sunnyvale , CA ) in the presence of 0.2  SYBR green I ( Molecular Probes ) .
Transcripts of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> and mRNA for the K + channels <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> , <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> and <termsem="EG:60613"> KCNQ4 </term> were amplified using gene-specific primers ( Table 1 ) .
RT was performed for 30 min at 50 C and 15 min at 95 C .
PCR consisted of 50 cycles of 1 min at 60 C , 1 min at 72 C , 7s heating to hot-measurement temperature , 13s hot-measurement at 3 -- 5 C below product melting temperature ( Table 1 ) and 1 min at 94 C .
Hot-measurements were performed to eliminate the detection of primer-dimers that had melting temperatures between 72 and 75 C [ 15 ] .
PCR was followed by a melt ( 60 to 95 C ) .
The generation of a single product of appropriate size was routinely checked by the presence of a single melt peak and by agarose gel-electrophoresis .
Product identity was confirmed by sequencing .
Template molecules ( T ) were quantified according to T = P / ( F ^ Ct ) where P is the number of product molecules , F is the fidelity of the reaction and Ct is the cycle at which the number of product molecules reaches a chosen threshold [ 15 ] .
Fidelity ( F ) was obtained from the slope ( S ) of the log-linear phase of the growth curve via a best-fit fifth-order polynomial : F = 7.39 + 3.80  S + 1.05  S2 + 0.15  S3 + 11.38  10-3 * S4 + 3.39  10-4  S5 .
The number of product molecules at threshold ( PCt ) was determined by amplification of known amounts of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> according to PCt = T  F ^ Ct. .
Quantifications of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> were used to compare tissue amounts .
Genomic contamination of inner ear samples was assessed to be < 0.02 % by omission of the RT step .
Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital ( 100 mg/kg i.p. ) .
Stria vascularis without spiral ligament was obtained by microdissection .
Currents generated by the stria marginal epithelium were recorded [ 16 ] .
A Pt-Ir wire microelectrode with a Pt-black tip was positioned 20 -- 30 m from the apical surface of the epithelium and vibrated at 200 -- 400 Hz by piezo-electric bimorph elements ( Applicable Electronics , Forest Dale , MA ; ASET version 1.05 , Science Wares , East Falmouth , MA ) .
A Pt-black electrode ( 26-gauge ) served as reference in the bath chamber .
The signals from the phase-sensitive detectors were digitized ( 16 bit ) at a rate of 0.5 Hz .
The output was expressed as current density at the electrode .
Animals were anesthetized with inactin ( thiobutabarbital sodium salt , 140 mg/kg ip ) .
The endocochlear potential and the endolymphatic [ K + ] were measured with double-barreled microelectrodes [ 17 ] .
Measurements were made in the basal turn by a round-window approach through the basilar membrane and in the apical turn after thinning the bone over the stria vascularis and picking a small hole ( ~ 30 m ) .
K + - selective electrodes were calibrated in solutions of constant cation ( K + and Na + ) concentration of 150 mM .
The minor selectivity of the K + electrodes for Na + produced a nonlinearity in the calibration curve , which was closely fitted by the Nicolski equation using nonlinear curve-fitting software ( OriginLab , Northampton , MA ) : V = Vi + S  log ( [ K + ] + A  [ Na + ] ) , where Vi is an offset term , S is slope , A is selectivity , and [ Na + ] is Na + concentration .
Calibrations were made immediately after withdrawal of the electrodes from the cochlea .
Plasma K + concentrations were obtained using a blood analyzer ( Stat Profile M , Nova Biomedical , Waltham , MA ) .
Data are presented as mean  sem ; n denotes the number of experiments .
Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05 .
In situ hybridization in the cochlea has suggested that pendrin mRNA is expressed in cells that reside immediately beneath the spiral prominence on the lateral wall of the external sulcus [ 8 ] .
To determine the location of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> protein expression , we performed confocal immunocytochemistry on cryosections prepared from temporal bones of normal ( <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + ) mice using an established antibody [ 3 ] .
Staining was absent when the primary antibody was pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide ( data not shown ) .
Strong expression of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> was observed not only in outer sulcus epithelial cells , as predicted from in situ hybridization data , but also in root cells , in apical membranes of spiral prominence surface epithelial cells and in apical membranes of spindle-shaped cells that are part of stria vascularis ( Fig. 1a ,1 b ,1 c ) .
The presence of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> in spindle-shaped cells suggests that these cells secrete HCO3 - into endolymph .
Pendrin-mediated HCO3 - transport has previously been shown in the kidney [ 9 ] .
HCO3 - in the cochlea may be generated from CO2 by carbonic anhydrase located in strial intermediate cells [ 18,19 ] .
CO2 may be supplied by the metabolically highly active stria marginal cells .
It is conceivable that <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> dysfunction interrupts HCO3 - secretion and leads to an accumulation of HCO3 - in stria vascularis .
Preliminary data ( Wangemann et al. , unpublished ) support a role for pendrin in HCO3 - secretion into endolymph .

The extent of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> expression in spiral prominence cells and stria vascularis was determined by labeling <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> , a K + channel that is expressed in strial marginal cells , and <termsem="EG:21872"> ZO-1 </term> , a tight junction protein that labels basal cells and thereby delineates the boundaries of stria vascularis .
Dual labeling experiments demonstrated that <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> is expressed in spindle-shaped cells , which are surface epithelial cells in stria vascularis adjacent to strial marginal cells near the borders of both the spiral prominence and Reissner 's membrane ( Fig. 1c ) .
In situ hybridization in the vestibular labyrinth suggested that pendrin mRNA is expressed in non-sensory cells [ 8 ] .
Using confocal immunocytochemistry on cryosections , we observed strong expression of the <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> protein in the apical membrane of vestibular transitional cells in the utricle and ampullae ( Fig. 1g ,1 h ,1 i ) .
Dual labeling with <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> demonstrated that <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> expression was clearly limited to vestibular transitional cells and did not extend to other non-sensory cells such as vestibular dark cells , which were clearly identified by the expression of <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> and <termsem="EG:16509"> KCNE1 </term> in their apical membranes .
The onset of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> expression during development of the mouse inner ear has been determined to be embryonic day ( ED ) 13 [ 14 ] .
Morphologically detectable differences in the inner ears of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice become evident as early as ED 15 , when <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice start to develop an enlarged endolymphatic space that persists into adulthood [ 14 ] .
Interestingly , sensory hair cells in the cochlea appear normal until postnatal day ( PD ) 7 but show clear evidence of degeneration by PD 15 [ 14 ] .
These observations suggest that the cochlear environment supports the survival of sensory hair cells in spite of the enlargement of the endolymphatic duct .
A normal endolymphatic K + concentration , which is critical for hair cell survival [ 20 ] , is established at PD 3 [ 21 ] and may persist in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - at least until PD 7 .
The time period between PD 7 and 15 is the time when the endocochlear potential develops at the onset of hearing [ 22 ] .
We hypothesized that a lack of a normal endocochlear potential or an alteration of the endolymphatic K + concentration could account for deafness in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice .
Measurements revealed that the endocochlear potential was absent but that the endolymphatic K + concentration was normal in adult <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - ( Fig. 2a ) .
No significant differences between <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice were found in perilymphatic ( Fig. 2a ) or plasma K + concentrations ( <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + , 4.9  0.3 mM , n = 6 ; <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - , 5.1  0.3 mM , n = 6 ) .
These observations suggest that a primary event leading to deafness in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice , and potentially in patients suffering from Pendred syndrome , is the loss of the endocochlear potential .
Degeneration of hair cells is probably a response to the loss of the endocochlear potential .

The endocochlear potential is generated by stria vascularis in the lateral wall of the cochlea [ 17,23 ] .
The potential is generated across the basal cell barrier of stria vascularis by the K + channel KCNJ10 located in intermediate cells [ 24 ] , which are connected to basal cells by a high density of gap junctions [ 25 ] .
Marginal cells of stria vascularis , which form the barrier toward endolymph , transport K + from the intrastrial space into endolymph and keep the K + concentration low adjacent to the KCNJ10 K + channel [ 26 ] .
To determine the cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice , we first determined whether intermediate cells are present in stria vascularis , since a loss of intermediate cells is known to lead to a loss of the endocochlear potential [ 27,28 ] .
Intermediate cells of stria vascularis were visualized by their pigmentation .
Pigmentation was present in stria vascularis of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice ( Fig. 2b ) , which suggests that intermediate cells are present .
Interestingly , pigmentation of stria vascularis was much stronger in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - than in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + mice .
To determine in greater detail the cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice , we isolated total RNA from stria vascularis and spiral ganglia of young ( 1 -- 4 month ) <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and both young and old ( ~ 12 month ) <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice , assessed amounts of isolated tissues by quantification of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> , and quantified the expression of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> mRNA .
Quantities of stria vascularis isolated from these different mice were similar , since no significant differences were found in the numbers of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> molecules ( log ( rRNA ) = 9.46  0.08 , n = 17 , pooled data ) .
In contrast , quantities of spiral ganglia isolated from young and old <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice ( log ( rRNA ) = 9.04  0.18 , n = 4 and 9.29  0.15 , n = 6 ) were significantly smaller than in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + mice ( log ( rRNA ) = 9.48  0.19 , n = 7 ) , consistent with morphometric data ( see below ) .
Expression of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> mRNA was normal in stria vascularis and spiral ganglia of young <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice but significantly reduced in old <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice ( Fig. 3 ) .
Quantifications of <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> and <termsem="EG:60613"> KCNQ4 </term> mRNA were used to assess possible cross-contamination between the stria vascularis and spiral ganglia preparations based on the assumptions that ( 1 ) <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> is expressed in cells of the stria vascularis but not the spiral ganglia preparation and ( 2 ) <termsem="EG:60613"> KCNQ4 </term> is expressed in cells of the spiral ganglia but not the stria vascularis preparation .
The number of <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> mRNA molecules in stria vascularis was 24-fold greater than in spiral ganglia , and the number of <termsem="EG:60613"> KCNQ4 </term> mRNA molecules in spiral ganglia was 5-fold greater than in stria vascularis .
These observations validate our measurements of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> and <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> by demonstrating that the microdissected preparations of stria vascularis and spiral ganglia were 98 % and 78 % pure , respectively .

The presence of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> mRNA in stria vascularis of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice supports the finding that intermediate cells are present .
Expression of the <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein was assessed in young <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice by confocal immunocytochemistry .
Interestingly , expression of the <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein was absent in stria vascularis but normal in spiral ganglia ( Fig. 4 ) .
The absence of the <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 K + channel </term> in stria vascularis is sufficient to explain the loss of the endocochlear potential [ 17 ] .

Histological evaluation of cryosections revealed an enlargement of scala media with a large bulging of Reissner 's membrane and an apparent degeneration of the organ of Corti , as described earlier [ 14 ] .
Tissue height of stria vascularis was normal ( Fig. 5 ) , consistent with the similar numbers of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> molecules in isolated preparations ( see above ) .
The absence of a change in tissue height is consistent with the presence of intermediate cells [ 28 ] .
Further , we observed an apparent loss of tissue masses in areas that are normally occupied primarily by type I and II fibrocytes .
Spiral prominence in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice was less prominent , spiral ligament thinner and spiral limbus flatter ( Fig. 5 ) .
The observation that tissue masses were lost in the spiral limbus region is consistent with the finding of a reduced number of <termsem="EG:19791"> 18S rRNA </term> molecules in the spiral ganglia preparation ( see above ) .
In addition , we observed an apparent degeneration of stria vascularis , including an increase in pigmentation and an irregular pattern of the tight junctions of marginal cells ( Fig. 2c , 6,7 ) .
Tight junctions were visualized by F-actin expression .
Marginal cells appeared to form a continuous layer .
Morphometric analysis of cochlear tissue masses in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice .
a : locations of measurements .
Thickness of stria vascularis ( SV ) was obtained as average of three distance measurements perpendicular to the surface of marginal cells .
Thickness of spiral prominence ( SP ) was measured perpendicular to a tangential line ( dashed ) that connects the surface of the outer sulcus ( OS ) with the basal layer of stria vascularis .
Thickness of spiral ligament ( SL ) was measured perpendicular to the tangential line as distance between the surface of spiral prominence and the interface between spiral ligament and bone ( B ) .
Thickness of spiral limbus ( LIM ) was obtained perpendicular to the surface of the bone as a tangential line that touches the inner sulcus ( IS ) and reaches from the surface of the spiral limbus to the interface between spiral limbus connective tissue and bone .
b : Summary .
Data from 7 -- 8 animals contributed to each column .
Analysis of marginal and basal cell barriers by in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice .
Tight junctions were visualized by F actin .
Whole-mounts of stria vascularis were viewed either from the basal cell side ( a-f ) or from the marginal cell side ( g-l ) .
Bright field images verify that the same area was viewed from either side ( b and h ) .
Colored bright field images were mixed with images of F actin staining to indicate the position of pigment granules ( d , j , f and l ) .
Focus was varied to either visualize the marginal cell barrier ( SMC , c-d and i-j ) or the basal cell barrier ( BC , e-f and k-l ) .
Both the marginal cell ( e-f ) and the basal cell barrier ( i-f ) appeared to be intact .
It was critical for this finding that pigmentation did not block the path of the laser .
Blockage of the laser by pigmentation produces the untrue impression of a discontinuous marginal cell barrier ( c-d ) or basal cell barrier ( k-l ) .
Comparison of images is aided by marking a significant area with a star .

<termsem="EG:23985"> Pendrin </term> - expressing surface epithelial cells in the spiral prominence region are located in an area where basal cells , which are interconnected by tight junctions , form additional tight junctions with surface epithelial cells [ 29 ] .
A discontinuity of this complex junction in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice would explain the absence of the endocochlear potential .
To evaluate the presence of this connection , we determined by confocal immunocytochemistry the expression of <termsem="EG:21872"> ZO-1 </term> and of F-actin , which associate with tight junction complexes .
<termsem="EG:21872"> ZO-1 </term> and F-actin expression revealed a continuous layer of basal cells , including a junction of basal cells with surface epithelial cells in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice , as observed in normal mice ( Fig. 1c ,1 d ,1 e ,1 f ,6,7 ) .
These observations make it unlikely that the primary cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential is a compromise in the basal cell barrier .
The observation that endolymphatic and perilymphatic K + concentrations were normal in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice suggests that stria vascularis was able to secrete K + in spite of the apparent signs of degeneration .
The rate of K + secretion necessary to maintain endolymphatic K + concentration , however , may be less than necessary in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + mice given the reduced numbers of sensory hair cells , which provide a major pathway for K + exit from endolymph [ 30,31 ] .
In order to substantiate the view that stria vascularis in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - secretes K + , we measured the magnitude of the bumetanide-sensitive current exiting stria vascularis across the apical membrane of strial marginal cells and determined the expression of the proteins <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> , <termsem="EG:16509"> KCNE1 </term> and <termsem="EG:20496"> SLC12A2 </term> , which are essential for K + secretion [ 20,32,33 ] , and of <termsem="EG:14619"> GJB2 </term> ( <termsem="EG:14619"> Cx26 </term> ) , which is thought to contribute to K + cycling [ 23 ] .
K + secretion is known to be sensitive to 10-5 M bumetanide , a loop-diuretic that inhibits the Na + / 2Cl - / K + cotransporter SLC12A2 [ 26 ] .
Bumetanide-sensitive currents were found in both <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice although the magnitude of the current was significantly smaller in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice ( 22  6 A/cm2 , n = 4 versus 14  2 A/cm2 , n = 4 ) .
<termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> and <termsem="EG:16509"> KCNE1 </term> , subunits of the secretory K + channel , were co-localized in the apical membrane of strial marginal cells ; the Na + / 2Cl - / K + cotransporter <termsem="EG:20496"> SLC12A2 </term> , which is located in the basolateral membrane of strial marginal cells , was found in stria vascularis ; and the gap junction protein <termsem="EG:14619"> GJB2 </term> was found in spiral ligament of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> + / + and <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice ( Fig. 8 ) .
Co-localization of <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> and <termsem="EG:16509"> KCNE1 </term> proteins was also observed in vestibular dark cells ( Fig. 1i ) .
Expression of <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> protein in stria vascularis of <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice is consistent with the finding of <termsem="EG:16535"> KCNQ1 </term> mRNA expression ( Fig. 3 ) .
These observations make it unlikely that the primary cause of the loss of the endocochlear potential is a compromise of K + secretion by strial marginal cells or a compromise of gap junction mediated K + cycling .

We described locations of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> expression in the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth and detected normal endolymphatic K + concentrations in spite of an enlargement of this fluid compartment .
We found that <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice lack the endocochlear potential because they do not express <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein .
Intermediate cells protect stria vascularis by converting CO2 to HCO3 - and by detoxifying free radicals ( Fig. 9 ) .
CO2 and free radicals are generated by the large numbers of mitochondria in the metabolically highly active strial marginal cells .
Intermediate cells employ carbonic anhydrase to convert CO2 to HCO3 - [ 18,19 ] and catalase to detoxify free radicals .
To protect themselves from free radical damage , intermediate cells generate glutathione and melanin pigment [ 34-37 ] .
It is conceivable that loss of <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> , which may secrete HCO3 - into endolymph , results in an accumulation of HCO3 - and an alkalinization of the intrastrial spaces .
This extracellular alkalinization may enhance free radical stress , since it may inhibit the uptake of cysteine and thereby limit production of the protective glutathione [ 38 ] .
Support for the hypothesis of enhanced free radical stress comes from the observed hyperpigmentation in mice lacking <termsem="EG:23985"> pendrin </term> .
Strial hyperpigmentation has also been observed in other conditions that are associated with free radical stress , such as acoustic trauma [ 37 ] .
Alterations in the cytosolic pH in conjunction with free radical stress may lead to the loss of <termsem="EG:16513"> KCNJ10 </term> protein expression in strial intermediate cells .
Function and expression of other K + channels has been shown to be controlled by the cytosolic pH and free radicals , which encode the metabolic state of the cell [ 39 ] .
Suppression of the <termsem="EG:3766"> KCNJ10 K + channel </term> in strial intermediate cells , which is essential for the generation of the endocochlear potential , is probably the direct cause of deafness in <termsem="EG:23985"> Slc26a4 </term> - / - mice and patients suffering from Pendred syndrome .
