Inactivation of the Huntington 's disease gene ( Hdh ) impairs anterior streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and early patterning of the mouse embryo .
Huntingtin , the HD gene encoded protein mutated by polyglutamine expansion in Huntington 's disease , is required in extraembryonic tissues for proper <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> , implicating its activities in nutrition or patterning of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> embryo .
To test these possibilities , we have used whole mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> to examine <termsem="GO:0009880"> embryonic patterning </term> and morphogenesis in homozygous Hdhex4/5 huntingtin deficient embryos .
In the absence of huntingtin , expression of nutritive genes appears normal but E7 .0 -- 7.5 embryos exhibit a unique combination of <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> defects .
Notable are a shortened primitive streak , absence of a proper node and diminished <termsem="GO:0032502"> production </term> of anterior streak derivatives .
Reduced Wnt3a , Tbx6 and Dll1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> signify decreased paraxial mesoderm and reduced Otx2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and lack of headfolds denote a failure of head <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
In addition , genes initially broadly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> are not properly restricted to the posterior , as evidenced by the ectopic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Nodal , Fgf8 and Gsc in the epiblast and T ( Brachyury ) and Evx1 in proximal mesoderm derivatives .
Despite impaired posterior restriction and anterior streak deficits , overall anterior/posterior polarity is <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> .
A single primitive streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> and marker <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> shows that the anterior epiblast and anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) are <termsem="GO:0007389"> specified </term> .
Huntingtin is essential in the early patterning of the embryo for <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the anterior region of the primitive streak , and for <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of a subset of dynamic <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> and <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> genes .
These findings provide fundamental starting points for identifying the novel cellular and molecular activities of huntingtin in the extraembryonic tissues that <termsem="GO:0065007"> govern </term> normal anterior streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
This knowledge may prove to be important for understanding the mechanism by which the dominant polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin determines the loss of neurons in Huntington 's disease .
Huntington 's disease ( HD ) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by CAG repeats in the HD locus that extend a polyglutamine tract in a ubiquitous HEAT domain protein called huntingtin [ 1 ] .
The molecular mechanism by which the new property that is conferred on huntingtin by the polyglutamine expansion leads to the hallmark loss of striatal neurons in HD is not known .
However , polyglutamine expansions in unrelated proteins that target distinct neuronal cell populations cause distinct ` polyglutamine ' neurodegenerative disorders .
This observation strongly suggests that the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine expansion in the context of huntingtin must be determined by some aspect of huntingtin 's structure , subcellular <termsem="GO:0051179"> location </term> or activities [ 2 ] .
Huntingtin is postulated to function as a flexible ~ 350 kDa HEAT domain <termsem="GO:0032947"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> scaffold </term> </term> that may facilitate the assembly and possibly the <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular location </term> of large protein complexes [ 3-7 ] .
Huntingtin 's large number of diverse cytoplasmic and nuclear <termsem="GO:0005515"> protein binding </term> partners strongly suggest that huntingtin may participate in a variety of <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular processes </term> that range from <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> of <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> complexes to gene <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> ( reviewed in [ 5,8,9 ] .
However , despite the potential importance of huntingtin 's normal function to our understanding of how the dominant polyglutamine mutation causes HD pathology , huntingtin 's precise molecular and <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular activities </term> have not been defined .
Therefore , we , and others , set out to discover huntingtin 's essential activities by studying the effects of huntingtin deficiency in the mouse .
Inactivation of the mouse HD gene ( Hdh ) has shown that huntingtin is not required for cell viability , as evidenced by the survival of mouse embryonic stem cells and neurons that lack huntingtin [ 10-12 ] .
However , huntingtin is needed at the level of the organism for proper mammalian <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> [ 10,13,14 ] .
Complete lack of huntingtin results in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> arrest during <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> , while severe reduction of huntingtin levels results in abnormal <termsem="GO:0022008"> neurogenesis </term> and perinatal lethality [ 15 ] .
Analysis of huntingtin deficient Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos reveals that homozygous inactivation of the mouse HD gene does not overtly affect <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> until E7 .0 .
By E7 .5 , mutant embryos exhibit a shortened primitive streak , reduced size and , by morphology , lack a node and head folds .
Mutants are rapidly resorbed by E8 .0 [ 10 ] .
Importantly , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of huntingtin only in extraembryonic tissues in chimeras rescues this <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> phenotype , suggesting that huntingtin is required only in cells of the extraembryonic lineage and acts in a cell non-autonomous manner at this stage [ 16 ] .
Extraembryonic tissues are essential for supplying nutrients and signals that <termsem="GO:0065007"> direct </term> anterior/posterior axis formation and patterning in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> embryo ( reviewed in [ 17 ] ) , implicating huntingtin in either or both of these processes .
Of these possibilities , the nutritive role has been more extensively investigated .
However , huntingtin deficient embryos do not display obvious visceral endoderm defects , with the notable exception of compromised <termsem="GO:0006826"> iron transport </term> in later stage mutants , although iron uptake is undisturbed [ 16 ] and <termsem="GO:0006897"> endocytosis </term> is not impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos or embryonic stem cells [ 16,18 ] .
By the same token , huntingtin <termsem="GO:0006810"> shuttles </term> through the nucleus , where it is required for proper nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of its <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> partners , suggesting that huntingtin may play a role in <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> cascades in extraembryonic tissues that <termsem="GO:0007389"> pattern </term> the embryo [ 18 ] .
Therefore , we have examined this hypothesis , by monitoring the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> that determine normal <termsem="GO:0009880"> embryonic patterning </term> and morphogenesis in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 huntingtin deficient embryos .
Our results support and refine the hypothesis , indicating that huntingtin is required for proper mesoderm <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> and for normal regional restriction of the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of a subset of <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> and <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> .
Huntingtin-deficient embryos exhibit abnormal streak progression and <termsem="GO:0048339"> paraxial mesoderm production </term> .
Since extraembryonic tissues supply nutrients to the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> embryo , we tested the possibility that huntingtin deficiency may perturb this function by performing <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR analysis to examine the expression of a panel of ` nutritive ' genes in E7 .5 wild-type and Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 huntingtin deficient embryos .
Consistent with a previous report [ 16 ] , no obvious differences were found in the expression of `` nutritive '' genes ( Hnf4 , Afp , Tfn , ApoAI , Apo-AIV , and ApoB ) or genes involved in yolk sac <termsem="GO:0030097"> hematopoiesis </term> or <termsem="GO:0001570"> vasculogenesis </term> ( Ttr , Rbp , Flt1 , Flk1 , Tal1 , Rbtn2 , GATA1 ) ( data not shown ) , suggesting that huntingtin is not essential for the proper <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> required for the nutritive function of the extraembryonic tissues .
To investigate huntingtin 's <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> activities , we then analyzed the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> which <termsem="GO:0007389"> pattern </term> the early embryo or mark <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenic </term> landmarks in wild-type and Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos by whole mount and section in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
The dissections confirmed previous morphologic data at E7 .0 -- 7.5 that all Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 homozygotes exhibit abnormal morphology , including shortened primitive streak and a lack of morphological head folds or node [ 10,13 ] .
The results of in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> analysis also confirmed that all three germ layers and extraembryonic tissue are <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in huntingtin deficient embryos .
Otx2 , normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the anterior neuroectoderm and anterior visceral endoderm [ 19 ] , is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in mutant embryos at E7 .5 ( Fig. 1A , B ) although the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domain appears reduced .
Similarly , Hesx1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is grossly normal in mutant embryos , with <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the AVE and neuroectoderm ( Fig. 1C -- F , [ 20 ] ) , although the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domain also appears reduced .
These results indicate appropriate specification and movement of anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) cells from the distal tip and suggest that neuroectoderm is <termsem="GO:0031128"> induced </term> in the mutant embryos .
AVE displacement and anterior neurectoderm <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> occur normally in the absence of huntingtin .
Whole mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> analysis of Otx2 ( A , B ) and Hesx ( C-F ) in E7 .5 normal ( A , C , E ) and mutant ( B , D , F ) embryos reveals that neuroectoderm and anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> normally in huntingtin deficient embryos , although the neuroectoderm <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domain is reduced .
Asymmetrical <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Hesx in mutant embryos ( F ) suggests that left-right <termsem="GO:0045449"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> control </term> is maintained .
Hnf3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the definitive endoderm extends around the distal tip and is reduced in the AVE ( * ) in both normal ( G , I ) and mutant embryos ( H , J ) .
Taken together , these results suggest normal ectoderm and endoderm <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> and <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos .
Embryos are shown in lateral views , with anterior to the left in all pictures with the exception of E and F. Embryos are viewed from the anterior aspect in E and F. To examine definitive <termsem="GO:0007492"> endoderm formation </term> , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Hnf3 ( FoxA2 ) in mutant and wild-type embryos was analyzed .
In wild-type embryos , Hnf3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is confined to the node and anterior definitive endoderm ( Fig. 1G , I [ 21 ] ) .
Mutant embryos exhibit Hnf3-reactive definitive endoderm over the disorganized anterior streak region and proceeding rostrally around the distal tip ( Fig. 1H , J ) .
In both normal and mutant embryos , the AVE exhibits little Hnf3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Therefore , huntingtin deficiency does not greatly affect Hnf3 <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> or the reorganization of the visceral endoderm .
The lack of a morphological node and presence of a shortened streak , together with reduced neuroectoderm and lack of headfolds , suggest that anterior streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> may be impaired in huntingtin deficient embryos .
To investigate this possibility , we examined <termsem="GO:0007498"> mesoderm formation </term> in mutant embryos .
Mesoderm is <termsem="GO:0007389"> specified </term> in the mutant embryos , as marked by the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of T ( Brachyury ) and Evx1 ( Fig. 2A -- F ) .
However , close inspection of the data reveals abnormal <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> within this tissue and its derivatives.T , normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the primitive streak , node and axial head process/notochord mesoderm [ 22 ] , is detected in the shortened streak and axial mesoderm in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , extending rostrally from a region of weakly positive cells ( Fig. 2A , B ) .
T <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appears weaker , however , in the anterior streak , corresponding to cells that will give rise to axial mesoderm ( Fig. 2D ) .
T is also ectopically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in mutant extraembryonic mesoderm at the anterior embryonic junction and along the chorion ( Fig. 2B , D ) .
Similarly , Evx1 , normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in primitive streak mesoderm at E7 .5 with highest levels in proximal cells [ 23 ] , is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the proximal shortened streak but is also aberrantly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the extraembryonic mesoderm , allantois and chorion ( Fig. 2E , F ) .
Extraembryonic mesoderm , derived from the proximal streak , does not normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> T or Evx1 in wild-type embryos [ 22 ] .
Therefore , the inappropriate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of T and Evx1 , the shortened primitive streak , and the absence of a morphological node , all suggest that the anterior primitive streak is deficient in the mutant embryos .
Huntingtin is required for formation of anterior primitive streak and paraxial mesoderm .
Whole mount and section insitu <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridizations </term> </term> of E7 .5 embryos shows T ( Brachyury ) ( A-D ) is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the primitive streak , node , axial mesoderm and Evx1 ( E-F ) is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the primitive streak , most strongly in the proximal streak wild-type embryos .
However , in mutant embryos , both T ( B , D ) and Evx1 ( F ) are ectopically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the extraembryonic region .
Wnt3A <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is reduced in mutant embryos ( H ) , although the <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> to the proximal streak is the same as in wild-type embryos ( G ) .
Analysis of paraxial mesoderm markers Tbx6 ( I , J ) and Dll1 ( K , L ) , reveals that these markers are reduced in mutant embryos ( J , L ) , suggesting impaired <termsem="GO:0048339"> paraxial mesoderm production </term> in the absence of huntingtin .
Embryos in A-H are shown in a lateral view with anterior oriented to the left .
Embryos in I-L are shown in a posterior view ( I , K ) or near posterior ( J , L ) view with proximal oriented toward the top .
In ( C , D ) , al = allantois , a = amnion , ch = chorion , ee = embryonic node ( N ) , em = extraembryonic mesoderm , n = node , ps = primitive streak .
Rather than a node , mutant embryos exhibit a region of disorganized cells ( * ) at the distal extent of the short primitive streak .
The anterior streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> generates </term> paraxial mesoderm .
Therefore we examined <termsem="GO:0048339"> paraxial mesoderm formation </term> in wild-type and mutant embryos , revealing deficits in mesoderm <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> .
Starting at E. 7.5 , Wnt3A is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the primitive streak in cells <termsem="GO:0001708"> <termsem="GO:0001709"> <termsem="GO:0045165"> fated </term> </term> </term> to become paraxial mesoderm .
In huntingtin deficient mutants , Wnt3a is induced in the proximal streak ( Fig. 2G , H ) , confirming stage appropriate posterior <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , in contrast to the absence of anterior head folds .
However , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Wnt3a is noticeably reduced in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , suggesting a defect in <termsem="GO:0048339"> paraxial mesoderm development </term> ( Fig. 2H ) .
Reduced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx6 in the mesoderm lateral to the primitive streak in mutant embryos confirms this interpretation ( Fig. 2I , J ) .
Furthermore , in mutant embryos at E7 .5 , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Dll1 in the distal streak region and in only a narrow swath of cells located laterally confirms the paucity of paraxial mesoderm ( Fig. 2K , L , [ 24 ] ) .
These results strongly suggest that anterior primitive streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> is impaired , resulting in reduced axial and <termsem="GO:0048339"> paraxial mesoderm formation </term> and impaired <termsem="GO:0007399"> neural development </term> .
Impaired regional restriction of <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the absence of huntingtin .
To elucidate the apparent <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> deficits , we next analyzed <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules that are required for early <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> .
Nodal , a member of the Tgf family of <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> molecules is required for the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and maintenance of the primitive streak and <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of the AVE [ 25-27 ] .
Nodal is normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the epiblast and overlying visceral endoderm at early post <termsem="GO:0007566"> implantation </term> stages [ 28 ] , but later becomes restricted to the posterior of the embryo to the site of primitive streak with asymmetrical visceral endoderm <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> marking the left-right axis .
By E7 .5 , Nodal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is restricted to the node .
Nodal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was assessed in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos heterozygous for the Ndl lac Z allele [ 28,29 ] .
Notably , heterozygous loss of nodal does not alter the Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 phenotype , as determined by morphology of Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 : Ndllacz/Ndl + embryos compared with Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos ( data not shown ) .
In contrast to wild-type embryos , which exhibit tight restriction of Nodal.LacZ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> to the node , Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 : Ndllacz/Ndl + embryos <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Nodal.LacZ throughout the endoderm overlying the epiblast , with higher levels in the posterior in an asymmetric pattern ( Fig. 3A -- D ) .
The lack of tight restriction of nodal signal is consistent with a failure to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> an <termsem="GO:0048532"> organized </term> node structure .
Impaired regional restriction of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in huntingtin deficient embryos .
X-gal staining of Nodal-LacZ embryos shows staining in endoderm near the node of normal embryos ( A , C ) but broad staining in mutant embryos ( B , D ) , although <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is higher in the posterior .
The tight node <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Nodal in normal embryos ( C ) is lost in mutant embryos ( D ) , consistent with the loss of a morphological node in the absence of huntingtin .
Whole mount and in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> of E7 .5 day embryos reveals that Fgf8 is detected in the proximal streak and is <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in cells <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrating </term> out of the streak in normal embryos ( E , G ) .
In contrast , Fgf8 remains highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in mutant embryos ( F , H ) .
Transient <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Gsc in the definitive endoderm overlying the prospective head region in normal embryos ( I , K ) is distinguished in other cell layers in normal embryos but remains unrestricted in mutant embryos ( J , L ) .
Earlier posterior <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Gsc is also maintained in mutant embryos ( J ) while it is <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> in normal embryos ( I ) .
Embryos ( A , B , E , F , G , H , I , K , L ) are shown in a lateral view with anterior oriented to the left .
Embryos ( C , D ) are in a posterior view .
Fgf8 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is also essential for normal <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> in the mouse embryo .
Fgf8 is required for <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> away from the primitive streak [ 30 ] .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expressed </term> just prior to streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> in the posterior epiblast and visceral endoderm , Fgf8 is restricted to the streak mesoderm at E7 .5 in a decreasing proximal-distal gradient and is <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in cells shortly after they exit the streak ( Fig. 3E , G ) .
In Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , Fgf8 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is strongly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the posterior region in the primitive streak and ectopically in the endoderm overlying the entire epiblast ( Fig. 3F , H ) .
However , streak derivatives appear to <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> normally as evidenced by the proper anterior <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of markers such as Otx2 , Hnf3 and Hesx1 anteriorly ( Fig. 1 ) .
Therefore , mutant embryos exhibit normal <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration </term> of streak derivatives but display impaired Fgf8 <termsem="GO:0048519"> repression </term> in mutant endoderm .
Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos also fail to restrict the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of goosecoid ( Gsc ) .
Normally , Gsc is initially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the visceral endoderm and proximal , posterior streak where the primitive streak will <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> prior to <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> .
As the primitive streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> forms </term> and extends , Gsc is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the distal streak , the node , and the axial mesoderm extending anteriorly from the node ( Fig. 3I , K , [ 31,32 ] ) .
However , in the mutant Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , high levels of Gsc <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> remain unrestricted in the endoderm overlying the entire embryo and ectopically in cells adjacent to the ectoplacental cone ( Fig. 3J , L ) .
These results suggest that , in contrast to proper Hnf3 <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> , Gsc remains inappropriately activated in mutant visceral and definitive endoderm , implicating huntingtin in the proper restriction of this homeodomain <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> .
Huntingtin is not required for <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of extraembryonic <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules .
Previous studies of chimeric embryos suggest that huntingtin is required only in the extraembryonic tissue for proper <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 16 ] .
Signals from the extraembryonic tissue are critical for the <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of embryonic signals and for <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> the epiblast .
Consequently , we examined extraembryonic <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in huntingtin deficient embryos .
Hnf4 is a <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the primitive endoderm as soon as this tissue becomes distinct and is a key regulator of visceral endoderm <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> factors such as alphafetoprotein , apolipoproteins , and transferrin .
Inactivation of Hnf4 results in impaired <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> [ 33,34 ] .
At E7 .5 , Hnf4 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the columnar visceral endoderm cells at the extraembryonic-ectoderm junction ( Fig. 4A , [ 33 ] ) .
In Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , consistent with normal primitive and visceral endoderm <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , Hnf4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appears normal , although the signal is stronger in mutant embryos compared to wild-type embryos ( Fig. 4B ) .
Similarly , Pem , a <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in proximal visceral endoderm and ectoplacental cone in wild-type embryos at E7 .5 , also is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in these tissues in the mutant embryos ( Fig. 4C , D [ 35 ] ) .
However , Pem <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> visceral endoderm hangs over the anterior of the mutant embryos , revealing abnormal <termsem="GO:0051179"> location </term> despite grossly normal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Normal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of extraembryonic markers in huntingtin deficient embryos .
Whole mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> analysis at E7 .5 of markers of the extraembryonic tissues reveals grossly normal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the absence of huntingtin .
Hnf4 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the visceral endoderm at the junction of embryonic-ectoderm junction ( A ) , is normal in mutant embryos , although the signal is slightly higher ( B ) .
Similarly , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Pem transcripts is maintained in mutant embryos ( D ) similar to normal embryos ( C ) , although Pem is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the abnormal lopsided overhang of visceral endoderm over the anterior of the mutant embryos .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of extraembryonic <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules is unaffected by the loss of huntingtin , as evidenced by the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Bmp4 ( E , F ) in the extraembryonic ectoderm , and Lefty1 and Dkk1 ( I-L ) in the AVE in mutant embryos .
Bmp4 is not <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> , however , to a ring of extraembryonic ectoderm in mutant embryos ( F ) as in normal embryos ( E ) .
Primitive germ cells ( PCGs ) are <termsem="GO:0031128"> induced </term> normally in both wild-type ( G ) and mutant embryos ( H ) , suggesting the Bmp4 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> from the extraembryonic ectoderm to the epiblast is normal .
Lefty1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appears disorganized in mutant embryos ( I ) compared to wild-type embryos ( J ) .
In contrast , the anterior <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Dkk1 in the AVE in mutant embryos ( L ) matches the wild-type <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern ( K ) .
Despite normal AVE <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , head folds fail to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in mutant embryos , even when cultured in nutrient rich media for 24 hours .
Wild-type E7 .5 embryos , when cultured in 75 % rat serum , <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> somites ( M ) , heart ( white arrow , N ) and head folds ( blue arrow head , N ) in culture .
In contrast , huntingtin deficient embryos continue to live in culture but do not <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> headfolds , heart or somites ( O ) .
Embryos are shown in a lateral view ( A-F , I-J ) with anterior oriented to the left .
Embryos in ( G , H , K , L ) are shown in an anterior view with proximal oriented up .
Signals from the extraembryonic tissues , including the anterior visceral endoderm and extraembryonic ectoderm are required for proper <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> of the epiblast [ 17 ] .
Bmp4 is a <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecule that is first <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> uniformly throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm and subsequently is <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to a ring of extraembryonic ectoderm adjacent to the epiblast ( Fig. 4E , [ 36 ] ) .
A key factor in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the node and primitive streak , Bmp4 is required for <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> the embryo along the proximodistal axis [ 37-40 ] .
In the absence of huntingtin , Bmp4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is properly maintained in the Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 extraembryonic ectoderm but is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the extraembryonic ectoderm ( Fig. 4F ) in a pattern that is similar to early Bmp4 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> rather than being restricted to a ring of extraembryonic ectoderm as seen in the wild-type embryos To assess Bmp4 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> from the extraembryonic ectoderm , we evaluated primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , which require Bmp4 for their <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> [ 37 ] .
PGCs can first be detected at E7 .0 and subsequently underlie the posterior portion of the primitive streak .
Whole mount staining of E7 .5 mutant and wild-type embryos for <termsem="GO:0004035"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> alkaline phosphatase </term> </term> activity reveals that PCGs <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , suggesting that Bmp4 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is functional in the absence of huntingtin ( Fig. 4G , H ) .
The anterior visceral endoderm ( AVE ) is also an extraembryonic source of signals that are critical for early <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> .
Wnt and nodal antagonists , Dkk1 ( mdkk-1 ) and Lefty1 respectively , are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the AVE and are important in limiting the posteriorization of the anterior embryo by restricting Nodal and <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> [ 41-43 ] .
In Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , both Dkk1 ( Fig. 4I , J ) and Lefty1 ( Fig. 4K , L ) are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> normally in the AVE as compared with wild-type embryos .
However , Dkk-1 levels appear to be slightly increased in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos , although the pattern of Dkk-1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> remains unchanged and this increase may just reflect the same amount of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in a smaller area .
Therefore , the ectopic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Nodal ( Fig. 3A -- D ) and the decreased Wnt3a <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Fig. 2H ) in mutant embryos do not appear to be result of changes in the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern of Lefty1 or Dkk1 .
Despite normal AVE <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and neuroectoderm <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> , head folds do not <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos .
Therefore , to determine whether mutant embryos are inherently capable of <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> head folds , embryos harvested at stage E7 .5 were allowed to progress in rich culture medium in vitro for 24 hours .
Wild-type embryos continued to <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> head folds , somites and hearts ( Fig. 4M , N ) .
In contrast , mutant stage 7.5 embryos did not <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> headfolds , hearts or somites , although these embryos continued to live ( Fig. 4O ) .
These results strongly suggest that in the absence of huntingtin , embryos are unable to undergo <termsem="GO:0048513"> organogenesis </term> , even if they continue to live past E7 .5 in a nutrient rich environment .
We have investigated the embryonic processes that require huntingtin in order to more precisely delineate huntingtin 's essential molecular and <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular activities </term> and to provide clues to the mechanism by which the dominant polyglutamine expansion mutation in huntingtin leads to HD pathogenesis .
In pursuing the finding that huntingtin is needed only in extraembryonic tissues for normal <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> , our data fail to provide evidence of abnormal nutritive <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos .
Instead , our results reveal that huntingtin is required for normal anterior streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and the consequent <termsem="GO:0048339"> production of paraxial mesoderm </term> , with a previously unrecognized role for huntingtin in the proper extinction of transiently and/or dynamically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> genes .
Indeed , the hallmark of the huntingtin deficient molecular phenotype is the impaired <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of a subset of dynamically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> genes , after the proper onset of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
This phenomenon does not reflect a lack of <termsem="GO:0009948"> anterior/posterior axis formation </term> , as evidenced by the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the AVE anteriorly and the primitive streak posteriorly .
Nor can it be simply explained by delayed <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , as stage-specific markers , such as Wnt3a and primordial germ cells , which are detectable at E7 .0 in wild-type embryos , are induced appropriately .
Furthermore , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of T and Evx1 in the extraembryonic mesoderm of mutant embryos is not a feature of wild-type embryos , even at earlier stages .
This strongly suggests that in huntingtin deficient embryos , the <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration </term> of the distal streak derivatives to the extraembryonic mesoderm occurs normally but that the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of these genes is impaired .
This impairment may also explain the failure of huntingtin deficient embryos to properly restrict the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Fgf8 , Nodal and Gsc .
Thus , huntingtin may play a direct role in the <termsem="GO:0045449"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulation </term> , or mRNA stability of these genes or it may act indirectly by intersecting with other pathways that <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> the expression of these genes .
The requirement for huntingtin in the extraembryonic tissues had prompted us to test whether impaired extraembryonic signals might be responsible for the dysregulation of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> within the epiblast that is observed in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos .
Extraembryonic <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos is associated with mildly elevated levels <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Hnf4 in the primitive endoderm and Pem in the lopsided anterior chorion but the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of other known signals , such as Bmp4 from the extraembryonic ectoderm , and Dkk1 and Lefty1 from the AVE , appear to be normal , although the slight increase in Dkk-1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos suggests that further investigation into <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> is warranted .
Moreover , extraembryonic Bmp4 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is not impaired in the absence of huntingtin , as the <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> of PCGs in mutant embryos is normal , implying proper <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> and <termsem="GO:0046903"> secretion </term> of the appropriate extraembryonic signals .
However , Nodal , Fgf8 and Gsc are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> ectopically in the visceral endoderm of Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos .
Both Nodal and Fgf8 , important <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factors </term> </term> required for normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of the epiblast , are tightly <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> during <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> .
Therefore , misexpression of either or both of these factors , or of goosecoid , in the visceral endoderm could contribute to the Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 mutant phenotype .
In addition , it is possible that other extraembryonic signal ( s ) that we have not analyzed may also be affected by the lack of huntingtin activity in extraembryonic cells in mutant embryos .
Huntingtin deficient embryos also fail to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> headfolds , and to undergo <termsem="GO:0048513"> organogenesis </term> , even after culturing in nutrient rich media .
The absence of headfold <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> in these embryos does not appear to be a result of a failure to <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> neurectoderm or a failure to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> the AVE , since mutant embryos <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> markers such as Otx2 , Ddk1 , Lefty1 and Hesx1 .
In addition , since node <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> is not required for neural <termsem="GO:0031128"> induction </term> [ 44-46 ] , the failure to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> a node in huntingtin deficient embryos is also unlikely to explain the lack of headfolds .
The apparent reduction of paraxial mesoderm in Hdhex4/5/Hdhex4 / 5 embryos could explain the lack of headfolds since paraxial mesoderm is important for the full <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of neuroectoderm , and consequently , headfolds .
Alternatively , the inability to manifest headfolds could suggest that huntingtin is required at a very early stage for normal <termsem="GO:0007417"> CNS development </term> .
This conclusion is consistent with the finding that severely reduced levels of huntingtin , from a hypomorphic Hdh allele , lead to abnormal brains later in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> [ 15 ] .
The cardinal features of complete Hdh inactivation that we observe are similar to the phenotypes that stem from the complete inactivation of the Polycomb group gene ( Pc-g ) Eed ( embryonic <termsem="GO:0007398"> ectoderm development </term> ) .
Indeed , complete deficiency for either huntingtin or the eed protein leads to abnormal streak <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , lack of headfold <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , ectopic T , Evx1 and Nodal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and disruption of anterior primitive streak <termsem="GO:0007498"> mesoderm production </term> [ 47 ] .
Interestingly , Eed protein is also required for proper trophoblast <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and normal maintenance of <termsem="GO:0006349"> imprinted </term> <termsem="GO:0009048"> X-inactivation </term> and <termsem="GO:0006349"> genomic imprinting </term> [ 47-49 ] , suggesting that these activities warrant investigation in huntingtin deficient embryos .
Thus , our observations provide unexpected starting-points in the search for huntingtin 's precise molecular activities , which began with the discovery that this HEAT domain protein hosts the dominant polyglutamine property that is the fundamental basis of HD pathogenesis .
In HD patients and in accurate genetic replicas , HD CAG knock-in mice , the dominant mutation specifically affects the major population of neurons in the striatum , without impairing huntingtin 's essential activities in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> [ 50-53 ] .
Indeed , homozygous HD patients <termsem="GO:0009058"> make </term> no wild-type huntingtin , and , in the mouse , a single mutant Hdh allele 's worth of mutant huntingtin can fully rescue huntingtin deficiency embryonic phenotypes [ 15,51 ] .
The quest to understand the HD mechanism , therefore , is aimed at delineating the huntingtin activity that may explain the striatal cell specificity of the polyglutamine mutant version of huntingtin .
One hypothesis is that huntingtin is normally involved in gene <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> , as proposed for NRSF/REST mediated BDNF <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 54 ] .
Now , our finding that huntingtin can be absolutely necessary for the appropriate <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of genes with dynamic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns in vivo , provides a compelling reason to elucidate the cellular machinery that is necessary for huntingtin mediated gene <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> .
Our findings indicate that huntingtin is required for proper <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> of the epiblast during early <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> , for proper anterior streak and node <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , primitive streak progression , paraxial mesoderm and head fold formation , as well as for the proper restriction of transiently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> and <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> genes .
Knowledge of the molecular basis of these changes in huntingtin deficient embryos should facilitate the identification of the <termsem="GO:0009987"> cellular pathways </term> that are dependent on huntingtin activities .
These will be important for implicating candidates to be assessed in the extraembryonic signals that determine anterior streak progression in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> embryo and in delineating the dominant activity of the polyglutamine tract in huntingtin that determines the striatal specificity of HD .
