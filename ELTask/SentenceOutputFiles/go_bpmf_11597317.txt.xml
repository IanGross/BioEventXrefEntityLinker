BRCA2 and homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
Two recent papers provide new evidence relevant to the role of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 in <termsem="GO:0006281"> DNA repair </term> .
Moynahan et al provide genetic data indicating a requirement for BRCA2 in homology-dependent ( recombinational ) repair of DNA double-strand breaks .
The second paper , by Davies et al , begins to address the mechanism through which BRCA2 makes its contribution to <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> .
BRCA2 appears to function in <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> via interactions with the major eukaryotic <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> RAD51 [ 1,2,3 ] .
We briefly review the context in which the two studies were carried out , we comment on the results presented , and we discuss models designed to account for the role of BRCA2 in RAD51 -- mediated <termsem="GO:0006281"> repair </term> .
Keywords : breast cancer , homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
BRCA2 was the second breast cancer susceptibility gene to be discovered , and was isolated through positional cloning using data from families with inherited breast cancer [ 4 ] .
Cells with mutant BRCA2 protein are , like many cancer cells , genetically unstable and accumulate gross chromosomal rearrangements [ 5,6 ] .
The sequence of this large protein ( 3418 amino acids ) offers very little clue to its function , although there are eight repeated segments ( termed BRC repeats ) in the middle of the protein that are highly conserved among mammalian orthologs [ 7,8 ] .
Breast cancer susceptibility genes and <termsem="GO:0006281"> DNA repair </term> .
Following the landmark discovery by Scully et al that the homologous <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> RAD51 colocalizes at subnuclear sites with BRCA1 [ 9 ] , a number of additional results have provided evidence that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair of DNA damage </term> .
BRCA1 and BRCA2 <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> discrete nuclear foci during the <termsem="GO:0051320"> S phase </term> and after exposure to DNA damaging agents [ 9,10,11 ] .
These foci are probably sites of repair of spontaneous and induced DNA damage [ 12,13,14 ] .
Cell lines defective in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 are sensitive to damaging agents that form double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) , as are other cell lines defective in <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> ( reviewed in [ 15 ] ) .
BRCA2 interacts with the RAD51 <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> via direct protein-protein contacts [ 16,17,18,19 ] .
Biochemical analysis also showed interaction between BRCA1 and RAD51 , although these detected interactions may have been indirect [ 9 ] .
The BRC repeats of BRCA2 are responsible for direct RAD51 interaction .
Cells lacking BRCA1/2 fail to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> damage-induced subnuclear RAD51 foci with normal efficiency , suggesting that these proteins are required for the formation of <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> complexes at the sites of DNA damage [ 20,21 ] .
Finally , genetic measurements of <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> frequency have shown that Brca1 - / - embryonic stem ( ES ) cells are deficient in recombinational <termsem="GO:0006302"> DSB repair </term> [ 22,23 ] .
The similarity between phenotypes associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency , together with data showing a similar effect of DNA damage on distribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in <termsem="GO:0006281"> repair </term> - proficient cells , led to the hypothesis that BRCA2 , like BRCA1 , is required for efficient <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> .
The paper by Moynahan et al [ 24 ] provides important support for this hypothesis .
Measuring DSB-induced <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> frequency in BRCA2-defective cells .
Pierce et al have designed a set of <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> substrates for measuring the level of homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in vivo ( Fig. 1 ) [ 25 ] .
The DNA substrate contains a pair of mutated GFP genes ( GFP encodes the easily detected green fluorescent protein ) , one of which contains a restriction site for I-SceI , a yeast intron encoded <termsem="GO:0004519"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> endonuclease </term> </term> with an 18 base pair recognition site .
Transient <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> of an I-SceI <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> vector results in the production of a DSB in the first mutated copy of GFP .
One or both DNA ends formed by the break <termsem="GO:0042148"> invade ( s ) </term> the homologous sequence in the second mutant GFP copy , resulting in repair of the DSB via a homology-mediated gene conversion event .
The configuration of the GFP construct is such that <termsem="GO:0000724"> homology-mediated repair </term> often results in the <termsem="GO:0009058"> formation </term> of a functional copy of GFP .
Such events can be detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis by virtue of their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of GFP .
Moynahan et al [ 24 ] have used such a GFP <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> substrate to demonstrate that cells with defective BRCA2 protein are deficient in their ability to <termsem="GO:0006281"> repair </term> the I-SceI-induced DSB through homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of I-SceI resulted in 1 out of 1400 cells <termsem="GO:0009058"> producing </term> GFP via homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in the human pancreatic tumor cell line CAPAN-1 .
CAPAN-1 cells carry a deletion of BRCA2 on one homolog and codes for a protein truncated at amino acid 1981 on the other homolog .
The authors indicate that the level of I-SceI-induced <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in CAPAN-1 is over 100-fold less than that seen using other ( BRCA2 + ) human tumor cell lines .
The different lines examined , however , are very likely to differ genetically from CAPAN-1 cells not only at the BRCA2 locus , but also at a very large number of additional loci .
This raises the possibility that some or even all of the <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> defect seen in CAPAN-1 could be due to mutations at non-BRCA2 loci .
While Moynahan et al were careful to point out this problem , two sets of results argue against the possibility that the <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> deficiency of CAPAN-1 cells is completely independent of its defect in BRCA2 .
First , in the same study [ 24 ] , <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> in a mouse ES cell line that <termsem="GO:0010467"> expresses </term> only truncated BRCA2 protein was measured .
This line was found to have lower <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> efficiency than isogenic cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> full-length BRCA2 ( the defect observed was about fivefold to sixfold ) .
Second , in an independent study , Powell was able to compare derivatives of CAPAN-1 that differed only in their ability to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> full-length BRCA2 protein ( S. Powell , personal communication , 2001 ) .
In these experiments , the derivative <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> full-length BRCA2 <termsem="GO:0032502"> yielded </term> 10-fold more recombinants than controls <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> only truncated BRCA2 ( S. Powell , personal communication , 2001 ) .
While the experimental design of these experiments was somewhat different from that of Moyna-han et al [ 24 ] , the results raise the possibility that CAPAN-1 cells have more than one mutation that lowers the efficiency of <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> relative to that observed in other human cell lines .
Conversely , the BRCA2 defect in CAPAN-1 could be fully responsible for the 100-fold defect in <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> if the level of BRCA2 complementation observed by Powell was incomplete .
Furthermore , the discrepancy between the 100-fold difference between CAPAN-1 and the other human lines as compared with the fivefold to sixfold difference between the Brca2lex1/lex2cells and Brca2 + / + ES cells might simply be accounted for by the fact that Brca2lex1/lex2 is not a null allele .
Additional studies are likely to shed light on the efficiency of BRCA2-independent <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination pathways </term> .
Taken together , the results indicate that BRCA2 is indeed required for high levels of <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> in both human and mouse .
The function of BRCA2-RAD51 interaction .
The second paper providing evidence , by Davies et al [ 26 ] , is a biochemical study of the interaction between the homologous <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> RAD51 and a peptide consisting of one of the eight BRC repeats from human BRCA2 .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of a single BRC repeat ( BRC4 ) had previously been reported to act as an inhibitor of <termsem="GO:0006281"> DNA repair </term> by Chen et al [ 27 ] .
These investigators showed that <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of constructs containing the BRC4 repeat in MCF-7 cells enhances the radiosensitivity of cells and blocks both the <termsem="GO:0031576"> <termsem="GO:0051319"> G2 </term> / <termsem="GO:0000279"> M </term> delay </term> associated with damage and the ability of the <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> cells to <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> subnuclear RAD51 foci .
In the paper by Davies et al , data provide evidence for a plausible mechanism of the dominant negative effect associated with <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of a single BRC repeat .
<termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> assays and electron microscopy methods were used to show that a BRC3 peptide interferes with the ability of RAD51 to <termsem="GO:0022607"> assemble </term> into oligomeric filaments on DNA .
A BRC4 peptide was also reported to inhibit the RAD51 -- DNA interaction .
These experiments raise the possibility that the full-length BRCA2 protein could act as a negative regulator of inappropriate RAD51 -- DNA interaction .
The final experiment reported by Davies et al [ 26 ] is particularly important with respect to understanding the mechanism ( s ) through which BRCA2 <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> RAD51-dependent <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> .
The <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of RAD51 was examined in CAPAN-1 cells , the same human tumor line examined by Moynahan et al [ 24 ] .
It had been shown previously that the small amount of truncated BRCA2 protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by CAPAN-1 cells was mislocalized to the cytoplasm , consistent with the fact that the truncation protein lacks a nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> signal [ 28 ] .
Davies et al showed CAPAN-1 cells to be defective in nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of RAD51 , raising the possibility that RAD51 is normally <termsem="GO:0006810"> carried </term> to the nucleus by <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> BRCA2 .
It is possible that RAD51 may alternatively be capable of BRCA2-independent <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> , but mislocalization of BRCA2 to the cytoplasm may <termsem="GO:0051235"> sequester </term> RAD51 and block its normal mode of <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> .
Support for the hypothesis that the observed mislocalization of RAD51 is an indirect consequence of the BRCA2 defect requires reintroduction of functional BRCA2 into CAPAN-1 .
Given the elaborate nature of the RAD51 -- BRCA2 interaction , it seems somewhat unlikely that the only role of BRCA2 in <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> is to serve as a specific nuclear <termsem="GO:0005215"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transporter </term> </term> of RAD51 .
An attractive alternative , favored by Davies et al [ 26 ] , is that the association of RAD51 -- BRCA2 is required to maintain RAD51 in a form that is in a state of ` readiness ' ( Fig. 2a ) .
In the absence of this interaction with BRCA2 , RAD51 might exist in a form that is not capable of being <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> into a functional <termsem="GO:0006281"> repair </term> complex when damage occurs .
For example , previous studies indicated that RAD51 shows little <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> preference for single-strand DNA ( ssDNA ) over double-strand DNA ( dsDNA ) [ 3,29 ] .
This result could mean that <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> factors , such as BRCA2 , are required to <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> RAD51 -- dsDNA interactions to prevent <termsem="GO:0051235"> sequestration </term> of RAD51 in a nonfunctional form .
Alternatively , or in addition , <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppression </term> of RAD51 -- ssDNA interaction might be important for preventing RAD51 from binding to the regions of ssDNA that form during normal <termsem="GO:0006260"> DNA replication </term> .
BRCA2 may thus <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> RAD51 assembly into <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> complexes via a <termsem="GO:0048519"> negative regulatory mechanism </term> ( i.e. by blocking RAD51 -- BRCA2 interaction until damage has occurred and factors required for ` productive ' <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> of RAD51 at damaged sites are in place ) .
As mentioned previously , the ability of a BRC peptide to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repress </term> the RAD51 -- BRCA2 interaction could reflect a role of full-length protein in <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressing </term> unwanted RAD51 -- BRCA2 interactions .
Yet another potential role for BRCA2 in <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> RAD51-dependent <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> is a positive role in <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> of RAD51 at damaged sites ( Fig. 2b ) .
Several proteins that interact with RAD51 are thought to ` mediate ' <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> of RAD51 at sites of DNA damage ( reviewed in [ 30 ] ) .
RAD51 paralogs in particular , including XRCC2 , XRCC3 , RAD51B , RAD51C and RAD51D , may function as a complex that actively <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> RAD51 <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> [ 31 ] .
BRCA2 could cooperate with RAD51 paralogs in <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> RAD51 <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> , or even provide an alternative <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly pathway </term> .
The observation that BRCA2 <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> to damage-induced subnuclear foci with RAD51 seems consistent with the possibility that BRCA2 plays a positive role in assembly of the <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> complex [ 11 ] .
Finally , it is important to note that the two models for the function of the BRCA2 -- RAD51 interaction shown in Figure 2 are not mutually exclusive .
BRCA2 could prevent inappropriate RAD51 <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> in the absence of damage and <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> functional RAD51 <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> at DNA lesions during the damage <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> .
Further experiments are clearly required to clarify the functional interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51 during <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> .
It should be relatively straightforward to determine whether the role of BRCA2 is limited to <termsem="GO:0006810"> transporting </term> RAD51 to the nucleus .
If this were the case , addition of a nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> signal to RAD51 should <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> the RAD51-mediated phenotypes associated with a BRCA2 mutation .
However , biochemical experiments are needed to determine whether full-length BRCA2 blocks or <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> RAD51 -- BRCA2 interaction .
Such experiments could also reveal additional roles for BRCA2 in <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> .
However , several technical obstacles , including the large size of BRCA2 , promise to make biochemical characterization of BRCA2 function difficult .
DSB = double-strand break ; dsDNA = double-strand DNA ; ES = embryonic stem ; GFP = green fluorescent protein ; ssDNA = single-strand DNA .
<termsem="GO:0006310"> Recombination </term> substrates used for assaying <termsem="GO:0000724"> homology-directed repair </term> .
Cutting at the I-SceI site within the mutant GFP ( SceGFP ) results in a double-strand break that can be <termsem="GO:0006281"> repaired </term> through homologous gene conversion using a 3 ' - truncated copy of GFP as sequence donor .
The mechanism results in the <termsem="GO:0009058"> formation </term> of a functional copy of the GFP gene .
The model shown assumes gene conversion occurs via the <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> - dependent <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> annealing mechanism </term> </term> .
Potential roles of BRCA2 in <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> of Rad51 at sites of DNA damage .
Chromosomal DNA is shown as pairs of straight lines , Rad51 as open circles , and BRCA2 as grey bars .
( a ) Prevention of nonproductive DNA interactions .
BRCA2 -- Rad51 interaction is proposed to <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> RAD51 -- BRCA2 interactions until DNA damage is present .
When damage occurs , Rad51 is <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> to damaged sites where is <termsem="GO:0051258"> polymerizes </term> into nucleoprotein filaments .
In this model , BRCA2 is not required for assembly of functional complexes at damaged sites , only to prevent a substantial fraction of Rad51 from being <termsem="GO:0051235"> sequestered </term> in a nonfunctional form .
In a BRCA2-defective cell , mutant Rad51 becomes associated with DNA at random sites and is therefore not readily <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> to sites of damage .
( b ) <termsem="GO:0048518"> Positive regulation </term> .
BRCA2 is proposed to be required for Rad51 to <termsem="GO:0022607"> assemble </term> into functional <termsem="GO:0000725"> recombinational repair </term> complexes at sites of damage .
In BRCA-defective cells , Rad51 fails to associate with sites of damage due to lack of an <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> factor .
