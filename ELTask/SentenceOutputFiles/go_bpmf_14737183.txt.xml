<termsem="GO:0009953"> Dorsoventral Patterning </term> of the Mouse Coat by Tbx15 .
Many members of the animal kingdom display coat or skin color differences along their dorsoventral axis .
To determine the mechanisms that <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> regional differences in <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> , we have studied how a classical mouse mutation , droopy ear ( deH ) , affects dorsoventral skin characteristics , especially those under <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the Agouti gene .
Mice carrying the Agouti allele black-and-tan ( at ) normally have a sharp boundary between dorsal black hair and yellow ventral hair ; the deH mutation raises the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary , producing an apparent dorsal-to-ventral transformation .
We identify a 216 kb deletion in deH that removes all but the first exon of the Tbx15 gene , whose embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> mesenchyme correlates with pigmentary and skeletal malformations observed in deH/deH animals .
<termsem="GO:0009058"> Construction </term> of a targeted allele of Tbx15 confirmed that the deH phenotype was caused by Tbx15 loss of function .
Early embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in dorsal mesenchyme is complementary to Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in ventral mesenchyme ; in the absence of Tbx15 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti in both embryos and postnatal animals is displaced dorsally .
Transplantation experiments demonstrate that positional identity of the skin with regard to dorsoventral <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> differences is <termsem="GO:0032502"> acquired </term> by E12 .5 , which is shortly after early embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 .
Fate-mapping studies show that the dorsoventral <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary is not in register with a previously identified dermal cell lineage boundary , but rather with the limb dorsoventral boundary .
Embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in dorsolateral mesenchyme provides an instructional cue required to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> the future positional identity of dorsal dermis .
These findings represent a novel role for T-box gene action in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> , identify a previously unappreciated aspect of <termsem="GO:0009953"> dorsoventral patterning </term> that is widely represented in furred mammals , and provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie region-specific differences in body morphology .
A fundamental question in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> biology is how adjacent regions of the vertebrate body <termsem="GO:0032502"> acquire </term> differences in their appearance or morphology .
Mechanisms that <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> the general body plan make use of a relatively small number of <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> shared among all animals ( reviewed in Pires-daSilva and Sommer 2003 ) , but the extent to which these pathways <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> finer differences between body regions is not clear .
Among vertebrates , differences in the shape or number of skeletal elements , altered morphology of epidermal appendages , and variation in pigment <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> combine to produce the majority of what distinguishes one animal from another .
Among these , pigment patterns are an excellent system to investigate how morphological differences arise , both for different regions of the body within a species and for different animals from closely related species .
In natural environments , color variation is a nearly universal mechanism for recognition , camouflage , or both ; consequently , a large number of pigment patterns have been characterized from an evolutionary and ecological perspective ( Boughman 2001 ; Jiggins et al. 2001 ) .
In the laboratory , color variation has been the subject of vertebrate genetics for more than a century ( Searle 1968 ; Silvers 1979 ) , and many pigmentary components have been identified whose actions are understood in a cellular or organ-based context ( reviewed in Bennett and Lamoreux 2003 ) .
Several mechanisms may contribute to regional differences in vertebrate <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> .
In the embryo , alterations in the <termsem="GO:0001709"> determination </term> or migration of melanoblasts from the neural crest affect the number or distribution of pigment cells in the skin ( reviewed in Reedy et al. 1998 ) .
Within hair follicles , paracrine signals <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> the type of pigment <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> in specific regions of the body or at specific times during the <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair cycle </term> ( reviewed in Furumura et al. 1996 ; Barsh et al. 2000 ) .
Finally , <termsem="GO:0051904"> movement of pigment granules </term> within melanocytes or from melanocytes to keratinocytes makes use of cellular machinery that is shared by a variety of cell types , but that can vary in different regions of the body ( reviewed in Marks and Seabra 2001 ) .
However , for all of these mechanisms -- white spotting , pigment-type switching , and melanosome <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> -- more is known about the identity of the molecular components than their spatial and temporal <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> .
One of the most obvious aspects of regional color variation in vertebrates is a dark dorsal surface juxtaposed to a light ventral surface , apparent in the color of skin , scales , feathers , or hair , in which the boundary between dorsal and ventral compartments is often sharp and lies in register with the limbs .
In rodents and probably other mammals , this dorsoventral difference in hair color is brought about by differences in pigment type as determined by allelic variation of the Agouti gene ( Bultman et al. 1992 ; Miller et al. 1993 ) .
<termsem="GO:0046903"> Secreted </term> by dermal papilla cells within each hair follicle ( Millar et al. 1995 ) , Agouti protein causes melanocytes in that follicle to switch from the <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> of brown/black eumelanin to red/yellow pheomelanin .
Agouti protein has a short radius of action ( Silvers and Russel 1955 ) and can be switched on and off during a single <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair cycle </term> ( Bultman et al. 1992 , 1994 ; Miller et al. 1993 ; Vrieling et al. 1994 ) ; thus , its <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is thought to be responsible for the cream-colored or yellow ventral surface of mice carrying the black-and-tan ( at ) allele and for the yellow markings around the feet , ears , or head , i.e. , tan points or head spots , of certain dog breeds .
In laboratory mice , previous studies from our group and others identified two predominant Agouti mRNA isoforms that differ by virtue of their <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> initiation </term> site and 5  untranslated exons .
A `` <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair cycle </term> - specific '' transcript is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in both dorsal and ventral skin for 2 -- 3 days during early <termsem="GO:0042640"> hair growth </term> , while a `` ventral-specific '' transcript is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> throughout the entire period of active <termsem="GO:0042640"> hair growth </term> , but only in ventral skin ( Bultman et al. 1994 ; Vrieling et al. 1994 ) .
Animals carrying the at allele <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> only the ventral-specific Agouti transcript ( Bultman et al. 1994 ; Vrieling et al. 1994 ) and have black dorsal hairs and cream-colored to yellow ventral hairs , with a sharp boundary at the level of the limb -- body wall articulations and in the middle of the whisker pad .
Ventral-specific Agouti isoforms are also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skin from embryonic day 10.5 ( E10 .5 ) and beyond and may play a role in pigment <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> ( Millar et al. 1995 ) .
Thus , <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> elements for ventral-specific Agouti isoforms are <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> to dorsoventral positional cues <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> in the embryo and whose effects persist after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
The boundary between dorsal and ventral color compartments in at/at mice bears superficial resemblance to dorsoventral boundaries apparent for many other mammals , but <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> differences between dorsal and ventral skin seem likely to include more elements than the type of pigment <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> by hair follicle melanocytes .
In particular , dermis of the flank has at least two distinct origins : dermatomal derivatives of somites and loose mesenchyme derived from the lateral plate mesoderm ( Mauger 1972 ; Christ et al. 1983 ; Olivera-Martinez et al. 2000 ; Nowicki et al. 2003 ) ; these lineages are <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> early in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and could , in principle , set up compartments whose identity contributes to dorsoventral differences in adult skin .
To better understand the mechanisms that give rise to differences between dorsal and ventral skin and to the boundary between them , we have determined how several morphologic characteristics vary along the dorsoventral axis of the mouse and how these characteristics correspond to ventral-specific Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and the lineage boundary that distinguishes somite from lateral plate derivatives .
Our results indicate that the apparent uniformity of the dorsoventral boundary represents the sum of independent mechanisms that affect melanocyte density and/or <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , pigment-type <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> , and hair length ; surprisingly , none of these coincide with the somite -- lateral plate lineage boundary .
We also make use of a classical mouse mutation , droopy ear ( Curry 1959 ) , that produces a dorsal-to-ventral transformation of flank coat color by allowing expansion of the ventral-specific Agouti transcript .
By positional cloning and gene targeting , we identify an allele of droopy ear , deH , as a loss of function for Tbx15 , which encodes a T-box <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in a dynamic and spatially restricted manner in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skin and musculoskeletal system .
Embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and transplantation studies suggest that Tbx15 is required to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> certain characteristics of dorsal <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> in mesenchymal cells of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> flank .
These results identify a previously unappreciated aspect of <termsem="GO:0009953"> dorsoventral patterning </term> that is widely represented in furred mammals and provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie region-specific differences in body morphology .
Morphological Components of Dorsoventral Skin Differences .
Besides the obvious change in hair color that frequently distinguishes dorsal from ventral skin , casual observation suggests there are additional differences in hair length , distribution of hair type , and skin thickness .
Furthermore , dorsoventral differences in <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> can represent differences in the number and/or <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> state of pigment cells , as well as the type of pigment <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesized </term> in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti .
In particular , ventral hair of at/at animals can vary from cream-colored to reddish-yellow depending on age , strain background , and position along the dorsoventral axis .
To evaluate the relationship among these components , we compared their features among mice of different Agouti genotypes .
Semiquantitative measurements of hair length plotted as a function of dorsoventral position reveal that the apparent sharp boundary between dorsal and ventral pigment compartments in at/at mice coincides with a more gradual change in both hair color and hair length ( Figure 1A -- 1D ) .
Within the region of transition from dorsum to ventrum ( Figure 1B ) , flank hairs from at/at mice become progressively shorter and exhibit increasing amounts of pheomelanin deposition progressing from the tip to the base of the hair .
However , the region of transition for hair length is considerably broader than that for <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> and independent of Agouti genotype .
Although <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair-cycle </term> timing varies along the rostrocaudal axis , measurements of absolute hair length for mice matched for age and rostrocaudal level are remarkably similar ( Figure 1D ) .
Furthermore , measurements of relative hair length for animals of different age , size , and Agouti genotype also are very similar when normalized to body circumference ( Figure 1C ) .
Taken together , these observations indicate that variation of hair length along the dorsoventral axis is stereotyped and maintained through multiple <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair cycles </term> , with a transition in hair length that is gradual and encompasses the pigment-type transition in at/at mice .
Dorsal and ventral skin <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> at different rates .
Transverse sections of skin at postnatal day 4.5 ( P4 .5 ) exhibit dorsal hair follicles that are noticeably more <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> than ventral hair follicles , along with a gradual dorsoventral decrease in dermal thickness ( Figure 1F ) .
However , differences in skin thickness disappear by 3 -- 4 wk of age ( Forsthoefel et al. 1966 ) , and , overall , the proportion of different hair types is also similar in dorsa and ventra of adult mice .
In age-matched inbred mice , we observed a small decrease in the ratio of undercoat hairs ( zigzags ) to overcoat hairs ( auchenes , awls , and guard hairs ) in dorsum compared to ventrum ( Figure 1E ) , but there was no consistent difference in hair-type distribution for outbred mice ( data not shown ) .
Differences between dorsal and ventral <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> of at/at mice are usually attributed to pigment-type differences caused by ventral-specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti , but animals homozygous for a null allele of Agouti , extreme nonagouti ( ae ) , have ventral hairs that contain less melanin than dorsal hairs , giving a slightly paler appearance to the ventral coat ( Figure 1G ) .
Using DOPA staining as an indicator of tyrosinase activity , we observed a gradual dorsoventral transition in isolated dermis preparations from P4 .5 ae/ae mice ( Figure 1G ) .
By contrast , skin from at/at mice reveal an abrupt dorsoventral transition of DOPA staining , which probably reflects the additive effects of reduced melanin content ( as in ae/ae mice ) and <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> of tyrosinase activity induced by Agouti .
Melanin content of individual hairs is likely to be influenced both by the number of pigment cells and their follicular environment .
Regardless , dorsoventral differences in hair pigment content of ae/ae mice persist throughout multiple <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair cycles </term> into adulthood , similar to hair length ( but unlike skin thickness ) .
Thus , at least three characteristics distinguish dorsal from ventral skin : differences in pigment-type <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> ( depending on Agouti genotype ) , differences in hair length , and differences in melanin content .
Ventralization of Skin Morphology by the droopy ear Mutation .
Named after its effects on craniofacial morphology , droopy ear is a recessive mutation on mouse Chromosome 3 ; the original allele described more than 40 years ago by Curry ( 1959 ) is extinct , but a spontaneous remutation that occurred in Harwell , deH , is available through The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , Maine , United States ) .
External craniofacial malformations are the most obvious characteristic of deH/deH animals , including widely spaced eyes , small palpebral fissures , a broad nasal area , and a shortened skull held in an elevated position , which presumably causes or contributes to the abnormal position of the ears .
We became interested in droopy ear because the original allele was described to affect pigment pattern in a way that suggests a possible dorsal to ventral transformation : `` On a genetic background ( at and AW ) which causes the belly hair to be lighter than the back hair , the belly hair comes up farther round the sides of the body and face '' ( Curry 1959 ) .
An abnormal dorsoventral pigment pattern is readily apparent in at/at ; deH/deH mice , but comparison to nonmutant animals is more accurately described in terms of ventral , lateral , and dorsal regions ( Figures 1G and 2A ) .
The ventral region has short hairs with a gray base and cream-colored tip whose boundary coincides with the limb -- body wall junction ; both the appearance of this region and position of the boundary are approximately similar in at/at compared to at/at ; deH/deH mice .
The lateral region contains yellow hairs of progressively increasing length ; in at/at mice , the lateral region appears as a thin yellow stripe along the flank , but in at/at ; deH/deH mice , the lateral region is considerably expanded with a diffuse boundary along the dorsal flank , and a dorsal eumelanic region whose size is correspondingly reduced ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Total body size is smaller in mutant compared to nonmutant animals , but the proportion of body circumference occupied by the lateral region in mutant animals is increased about 2-fold , from 11.9 % to 22.2 % ( Figure 2C ) .
The proportion of the ventral cream-colored region is also expanded a small amount , 47.9 % in mutant compared to 37.8 % in nonmutant animals , but expansion of the lateral region , which occurs at all levels of the body , including the limbs and the cranium ( but not the whisker pad ) , is the major feature responsible for the ventralized appearance caused by deH .
To investigate whether deH affects other dorsoventral skin characteristics besides pigment-type switching , we examined its effects on hair length and <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> in an ae/ae background .
Overall , deH causes a small but consistent reduction in hair length in both dorsum and ventrum ; when mutant and nonmutant animals are normalized for body circumference , reduced hair length is most apparent in the lateral region ( Figure 2E ) .
Adult ae/ae ; deH/deH animals exhibit body-size reduction and skeletal abnormalities , but display no coat-color phenotype ( data not shown ) .
However , ae/ae and ae/ae ; deH/deH neonates are clearly distinguishable in the first few days after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , when a dorsoventral gradient of melanogenic activity is apparent under the skin ( Figure 2D ) .
At this stage , melanoblast migration from the neural crest is mostly complete , but there is a dorsoventral gradient in melanocyte <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and <termsem="GO:0046148"> pigment synthesis </term> .
The skin of ae/ae neonates appears uniformly dark over the entire dorsum , but in ae/ae ; deH/deH neonates , the area of dark skin is more restricted , particularly above the limbs , and resembles the pattern of dorsal eumelanin in at/at ; deH/deH adult animals .
Taken together , these observations suggest that deH interferes with the <termsem="GO:0009953"> establishment of dorsoventral patterning </term> during <termsem="GO:0043588"> skin development </term> by causing dorsal expansion of a lateral region that is normally 3 -- 5 mm in width .
This same region may serve as a boundary between dorsal and ventral skin by inhibiting melanocyte <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , by <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> pheomelanin <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> , and by supporting a progressive increase in <termsem="GO:0042640"> hair growth </term> from ventrum to dorsum .
As described below , the gene defective in deH , Tbx15 , is normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the dorsal region and therefore is likely to play a role in <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishing </term> the size and dorsal extent of the lateral region .
Positional Cloning of deH .
As a visible marker , early linkage studies with the original droopy ear allele or the deH allele identified a map position in the middle of Chromosome 3 , distal to matted and proximal to Varitint-waddler ( Carter and Falconer 1951 ; Curry 1959 ; Lane and Eicher 1979 ; Holmes et al. 1981 ) .
We used an F2 intercross with CAST/Ei mice to localize deH to a 0.1 cM interval between D3Mit213 and 16 .
MMHAP32FLF1 , which was refined by development of a bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) contig and additional markers to a 1.4 Mb region that contained eight genes , including Tbx15 ( Figure 3A ) .
We considered Tbx15 as an excellent candidate for the skeletal abnormalities caused by deH , based on studies by Agulnik et al. ( 1998 ) , who described its embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the craniofacial region and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limbs .
Using sequence information from Agulnik et al. ( 1998 ) and the partially completed mouse genome sequence , we found that portions of several Tbx15 exons could not be amplified from deH/deH genomic DNA .
The same gene was initially referred to as Tbx8 ( Wattler et al. 1998 ) and then later renamed Tbx14 , but is currently referred to in several vertebrate genomes as Tbx15 ( Agulnik et al. 1998 ; Begemann et al. 2002 ) .
By comparing the sequence of a 1.3 kb junction fragment amplified from deH/deH genomic DNA to publicly available mouse genome sequence , we identified a 216 kb deletion that extends from Tbx15 intron 1 to 148 kb downstream of the <termsem="GO:0043631"> polyadenylation </term> sequence in a region annotated as a mannose-6-phosphate <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> pseudogene , M6pr-ps ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
( Ludwig et al. 1992 ) .
By Northern blot analysis , we identified a fusion transcript <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> from the deH chromosome ( data not shown ) .
However , the deletion removes 534 of the 602 amino acids encoded by Tbx15 ( including the T-box <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> domain ) , deH / + animals are grossly normal , and the phenotype of deH/deH animals is identical to that described for the original allele .
In addition , other than M6pr-ps , no other genes or transcripts have been annotated to the 216 kb deletion .
While the positional cloning work was underway , one of us ( A. Russ ) generated an independent mutation of Tbx15 by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells .
The targeted allele , Tbx15LacZ , carries an IRES-LacZ - <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> cDNA cassette that disrupts the open reading frame at codon 154 early in the T-box domain ( Figure 3D ) .
Animals heterozygous for the targeted allele are completely normal with regard to size , skeletal morphology , and hair-color distribution , but Tbx15LacZ/Tbx15LacZ homozygotes were noted to exhibit reduced body size and an abnormal craniofacial appearance identical to that caused by deH .
We <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> Tbx15LacZ/deH compound heterozygotes ; on an Aw/at background , these animals exhibited the same abnormal restriction of dorsal <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> at P3 .5 and expanded yellow flank area as described above for deH/deH animals ( see Figure 2 ) .
These observations demonstrate that the pigmentary and craniofacial characteristics of deH are caused by loss of function for Tbx15 .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Tbx15 and Agouti .
Previous studies by Agulnik et al. ( 1998 ) using whole-mount in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> described <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 as first detectable at E9 .5 in the limb buds , progressing to the branchial arches , flanks , and craniofacial regions through E12 .5 .
To investigate this pattern in more detail , we <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> a Tbx15 mRNA probe to a series of transverse sections at E12 .5 and observed <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in multiple mesenchymal tissues of the head , trunk , and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limbs ( Figure 4A ) , much of which is consistent with the skull , cervical vertebrae , and limb malformations reported for mice carrying the original droopy ear allele .
We were particularly interested in determining the exact nature of the embryonic flank <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> relative to the ventralized phenotype of adult deH/deH mice .
Transverse abdominal sections from different times during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> reveal a dorsolateral band of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the superficial mesenchyme at E11 .5 that <termsem="GO:0048518"> broadens </term> both dorsally and ventrally over the next several days ( Figure 4B ) .
By E13 .5 , the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> dermis has become separated from the loose mesenchyme by a subcutaneous muscle layer ; Tbx15 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in all of these layers as well as the underlying abdominal muscles .
In P3 .5 skin , Tbx15 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in both dorsal and ventral skin , most strongly in the condensed upper dermis and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> dermal sheaths of hair follicles ; faint <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> can also be detected in rare dermal papillae cells ( Figure 4B ) .
Although the effects of Agouti on pigment-type switching occur during postnatal <termsem="GO:0042640"> hair growth </term> , the ventral-specific isoform of Agouti is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skin beginning at E11 .5 .
We compared adjacent sections <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> with probes for Tbx15 and Agouti and observed complementary patterns at E12 .5 , with <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti in ventral skin and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in dorsal skin ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
The junction between <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domains is indistinct , and by E14 .5 , Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> extends ventrally and overlaps extensively with Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 5C and 5D ) .
We also examined the effect of deH on <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti and found no difference between mutant and nonmutant at E12 .5 or E13 .5 ( data not shown ) .
However , at E14 .5 , the normal ventral-to-dorsal gradient of Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appeared to extend more dorsally in deH/deH embryos ( Figure 6A ) .
In P4 .5 skin , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti is also extended dorsally in deH/deH animals and is most apparent in the midflank region within the upper dermis and dermal papillae cells ( Figure 6B ) .
Thus , while the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> phenotype of deH/deH mice can be explained , not surprisingly , by dorsal extension of Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , patterned <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 and Agouti are apparent some 10 days earlier , between E12 .5 and E13 .5 , and the effects of Tbx15 deficiency on <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Agouti can be detected by E14 .5 .
Relationship of Embryonic Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> to Dorsal and Ventral <termsem="GO:0043473"> Pigmentation </term> Domains .
The observations described above are consistent with a model in which transient <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in the embryonic dorsal flank is required to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> positional identity of the future dermis , at least with respect to pigment-type <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> caused by the ventral-specific Agouti isoform .
To further investigate this hypothesis , we carried out transplantation experiments in which pieces of embryonic skin were isolated from different dorsoventral positions .
We evaluated the embryonic skin fragments for their potential to give rise to different hair colors and for their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 and Agouti .
Previous studies by Silvers and colleagues ( Poole and Silvers 1976 ) showed that dorsal and ventral skin isolated from at/at embryos gives rise to black and yellow hair , respectively , when transplanted into testis and allowed to <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> for several weeks .
Furthermore , dermal -- epidermal <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> experiments carried out at E14 .5 demonstrated that positional identity is carried by the embryonic dermis .
In a variation on this experiment , we divided embryonic skin from at/a embryos into dorsal , flank , and ventral pieces and analyzed the different pieces for their ability to give rise to black or yellow hair after testis transplantation , and , in parallel , for <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> using in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
For the purposes of a reproducible morphologic boundary , we divided flank from ventral skin based on a change in skin thickness and divided dorsal from flank skin at the level of an ectodermal notch that lies at the same level as the ventral extent of the myotome ( Figure 7 ) ( Huang and Christ 2000 ; Olivera-Martinez et al. 2000 ; Sudo et al. 2001 ; Burke and Nowicki 2003 ; Nowicki et al. 2003 ) .
We found that E12 .5 is the earliest time at which embryonic ventral skin is able to <termsem="GO:0032502"> produce </term> hair when transplanted to the testis .
Of the grafts that <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> hair , ventral skin gave rise to yellow hair ( n = 3 ) , and dorsal skin gave rise to black hair ( n = 4 ) .
Transplantation of flank skin gave rise to a patch of yellow hair juxtaposed against a patch of black hair in 85 % of the successful grafts ( n = 13 ) ; the remaining two flank grafts <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> solely black or yellow hair .
In no case did we observe intermingling of black and yellow hairs .
As predicted from the experiments using tissue sections ( see Figures 5 and 6 ) , dorsal pieces <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> Tbx15 but not Agouti , while flank pieces <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> both genes ( see Figure 7 ) .
Thus , dorsoventral identity for adult <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> is <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> by the time when patterned <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> becomes apparent for Tbx15 and Agouti ( E11 .5 -- E12 .5 ) ; furthermore , positional identity is maintained throughout later stages of <termsem="GO:0043588"> skin development </term> , even though <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0048518"> broadens </term> to include ventral as well as dorsal skin .
Relationship of the Dorsoventral Pigment Boundary to Lineage Compartments and the Lateral Somitic Frontier .
The ectodermal notch that we used to mark the boundary between embryonic dorsum and embryonic flank is a characteristic feature in vertebrate embryos .
In cell lineage studies carried out in the chick system , the notch serves as a landmark for the boundary between dermis derived from somitic mesoderm and dermis derived from lateral plate mesoderm and has been termed the `` lateral somitic frontier '' ( Olivera-Martinez et al. 2000 ; Sudo et al. 2001 ; Burke and Nowicki 2003 ; Nowicki et al. 2003 ) .
Although fate-mapping studies have not been carried out in mammalian embryos , somite - and lateral plate-derived mesoderm could give rise to precursors for dermis dorsal and ventral to the limb -- body wall junction , respectively .
However , this notion conflicts with our observation that the future <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary lies ventral to the ectodermal notch ( see Figure 7 ) .
To examine directly the relationship between the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary and dermis derived from lateral plate mesoderm , we made use of a Cre transgene <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by the Hoxb6 promoter that was <termsem="GO:0009058"> developed </term> by Kuehn and colleagues ( Lowe et al. 2000 ) .
As described by Lowe et al. ( 2000 ) , midgestation embryos carrying both the Hoxb6-Cre transgene and the R26R lacZ reporter gene ( Soriano 1999 ) exhibit X-Gal staining in lateral plate mesoderm but not somite-derived mesoderm of the trunk .
In whole-mount skin preparations from P1 .5 or P4 .5 neonatal animals , we observed a ventral band of dark X-Gal staining corresponding to lateral plate-derived dermis , which represents 63 % of the total circumference ( Figure 8A ) .
However , in parallel preparations from at/at mice , the ventral pheomelanin domain represents 47 % of the total skin circumference ; therefore , the proportions of total skin circumference occupied by dorsal eumelanin and somite-derived dermis are 53 % and 37 % , respectively ( Figure 8B ) .
These results indicate that the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary is clearly distinct from , and more ventral to , the boundary between lateral plate - and somite-derived dermis .
Because the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary lies in register with the limb -- body wall junction ( see Figure 2 ) , we wondered whether mechanisms used for dorsoventral limb patterning might be related to those used to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary .
In the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limb , Engrailed1 ( En1 ) , Wnt7a , and Lmx1b are part of a network whose restricted domains of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> help to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> dorsoventral identity ( reviewed in Niswander 2003 ) .
En1 is transiently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> flank ; at E11 .5 , transverse abdominal sections reveal domains in the neural tube , somite-derived mesenchyme , and the ventral body wall ( Figure 8C ) .
An adjacent section <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> with Tbx15 reveals a complementary pattern in the flank , which provides additional evidence for <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental mechanisms </term> that <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> a <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary entirely within lateral plate mesoderm and independent of lineage restrictions imposed by the lateral somitic frontier .
Several mutations and genes have been identified that affect the pattern of <termsem="GO:0001942"> hair follicle development </term> , but Tbx15 is the only gene of which we are aware that affects the pattern of hair <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> in different body regions .
Ventral areas that normally <termsem="GO:0032502"> produce </term> yellow hair in the trunk , limbs , and craniofacial regions are expanded in deH/deH mice and , in the trunk at least , represent inappropriate dorsal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of an Agouti mRNA isoform that is normally restricted to ventral skin .
The deH allele is caused by a large deletion that removes most of the Tbx15 coding sequence , but the pleiotropic phenotype is caused by a simple loss of function for Tbx15 rather than a dominant-negative or contiguous gene effect .
In particular , there is no heterozygous phenotype , no other genes lie within or close to the deletion breakpoints , and the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> pattern of Tbx15 is consistent with the spectrum of phenotypic abnormalities in both the original de allele and the deH allele .
Finally , a Tbx15 targeted allele has the same phenotype as deH .
Our results suggest that patterned <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 provides an instructional cue required to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> the future identity of dorsal dermis with regard to pigmentary and hair length <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> .
The ventral edge of Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> flank does not correspond to a known lineage compartment , but , like <termsem="GO:0060173"> limb development </term> , occurs within lateral plate mesoderm .
These findings represent a novel role for T-box gene action in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> and provide evidence for a previously unappreciated complexity to <termsem="GO:0009953"> acquisition of dorsoventral positional identity </term> in mammalian skin .
Distinct Morphologic Regions Represent the Sum of Different Gradients .
The <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual </term> boundary between dorsal and ventral skin in at/at mice is reminiscent of other systems in which adjacent compartments enforce a binary choice between alternative patterns of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> and cell fate ( reviewed in Dahmann and Basler 1999 ) .
However , Agouti mRNA in both embryonic and postnatal skin is <termsem="GO:0051179"> distributed </term> along a gradient whose dorsal boundary is indistinct and overlaps with two additional gradients recognized by their effects on hair length and histochemical staining for melanocytes .
The three gradients are close but not congruent , and it is their proximity that gives rise to the superficial distinction between dorsal and ventral skin of at/at mice .
Indeed , slight differences between the regions of transition for pigment-type switching and pigment content give rise to a subtle yellow stripe along the flank ( see Figures 1 , 2 , and 9A ) .
Levels of Agouti mRNA remain high throughout the entire ventrum , but hair pigment content is reduced , giving rise to a cream-colored region in the ventrum that , depending on age and genetic backgrounds , may appear more or less distinct from the yellow flank stripe .
Loss of Tbx15 affects dorsoventral transitions of hair length , pigment content , and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the ventral-specific Agouti isoform ; however , the former two effects are subtle and contribute little , if at all , to the abnormal <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> of adult deH/deH mice .
Thus , despite the abnormal pattern of dark skin in neonatal deH/deH mice ( e.g. , Figure 2D ) , the most obvious feature in adults is dorsal displacement of the `` boundary '' between black and yellow hair ( Figure 9A ) .
Named for the presence of a <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> domain first identified in the mouse Brachyury gene ( haploinsufficiency causes a short tail ) , T box -- containing genes have been identified as <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> regulators in a wide spectrum of tissues and multicellular organisms ( reviewed in Papaioannou 2001 ) .
The Tbx15 subfamily , which also includes Tbx18 and Tbx22 , is likely to have arisen during early chordate evolution since there is a single gene in amphioxus but no obvious homolog in the fly genome ( Ruvinsky et al. 2000 ) .
Consistent with this relationship , the three genes are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in partially overlapping patterns that include anterior somites ( Tbx18 and Tbx22 ) , limb mesenchyme ( Tbx15 and Tbx18 ) , and craniofacial mesenchyme ( all three genes , Tbx15 more broadly than Tbx18 or Tbx22 ) ( Agulnik et al. 1998 ; Kraus et al. 2001 ; Braybrook et al. 2002 ; Bush et al. 2002 ; Herr et al. 2003 ) .
These observations suggest that an ancestral gene for Tbx15 , Tbx18 , and Tbx22 may have been important for craniofacial <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in cephalochordates , with <termsem="GO:0032502"> acquisition </term> of additional <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> functions in the limb and the trunk during early vertebrate evolution .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Tbx18 and Tbx22 has not been reported in embryonic flank mesenchyme , which suggests that Tbx15 is the only family member involved in <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishing </term> the dorsoventral identity of the trunk .
However , it would not be surprising to find some degree of functional redundancy in animals mutated for two or three of the subfamily members in other body regions , particularly the limbs and the head .
For example , mutations in Tbx22 cause the human syndrome X-linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia ( Braybrook et al. 2001 ) .
Despite high levels of Tbx22 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in periocular embryonic mesenchyme ( Braybrook et al. 2002 ; Bush et al. 2002 ; Herr et al. 2003 ) , the condition does not affect the eye , perhaps because residual activity is provided by Tbx15 in the same region .
In an initial description of the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and map location of mouse Tbx15 , Agulnik et al. ( 1998 ) suggested human Tbx15 that lies on Chromosome 1p11 .1 as a candidate for acromegaloid facial appearance ( AFA ) syndrome , for which there is a weak positive LOD score to Chromosome 1p ( Hughes et al. 1985 ) .
Originally described as a rare autosomal-dominant syndrome with progressive facial coarsening , overgrowth of the intraoral mucosa , and large , doughy hands , more recent case reports describe macrosomia , macrocephaly , or both and generalized hypertrichosis with progressive coarsening ( Dallapiccola et al. 1992 ; Irvine et al. 1996 ; da Silva et al. 1998 ; Zelante et al. 2000 ) .
The deH phenotype exhibits little overlap with these features ; instead , we suggest a more likely candidate for mutations of human TBX15 would be frontofacionasal syndrome , an unmapped autosomal recessive condition characterized by brachycephaly , blepharophimosis , and midface hypoplasia ( Reardon et al. 1994 ) .
Two of us ( S. Kuijper and F. Meijlink ) became interested in the deH mutation because of its effects on <termsem="GO:0001501"> skeletal development </term> ( Curry 1959 ) and the possibility that the aristaless-related gene Alx3 might be allelic with droopy ear ( ten Berge et al. 1998 ) .
In spite of similarities between skeletal phenotypes of deH and Alx3 or Alx4 mutants , subsequent experiments ( unpublished data ) excluded allelism of Alx3 and deH , and a full description of the Tbx15 skeletal phenotype will be published elsewhere .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmental Mechanism </term> of Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> and Action in the Skin .
Our attention to the role of Tbx15 in pigment <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> was motivated by the effects of Agouti in postnatal animals .
However , Agouti is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the embryo , where it provides a convenient marker of ventral dermis identity .
Because an expanded domain of embryonic Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in deH/deH animals is detectable by E14 .5 , the effects of Tbx15 on <termsem="GO:0009953"> dorsoventral patterning </term> must occur prior to this time .
Among other T-box genes whose <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> actions are at least partially understood , two general themes have emerged , one focused on the ability to <termsem="GO:0001708"> specify </term> alternative fates for an undifferentiated group of precursor cells and another focused on the ability to support proliferative expansion of a cell population whose fate is already <termsem="GO:0001709"> determined </term> ( reviewed in Tada and Smith 2001 ) .
Either mechanism may apply to the apparent dorsal-to-ventral transformation in deH/deH mice .
For example , while the expanded domain of Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in postnatal deH/deH animals can be traced to events that occur between E11 .5 and E13 .5 , the underlying cause may be that embryonic cells in dorsolateral mesenchyme <termsem="GO:0032502"> acquire </term> a ventral rather than dorsal identity or that those cells fail to <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferate </term> normally , followed by compensatory expansion of ventral cells .
Cell lineage studies should provide a definitive answer , but we favor the latter hypothesis , because measurements of dorsoventral regions according to hair color in deH/deH mice revealed a small increase of the cream-colored ventral region in addition to the approximate doubling of the yellow flank region ( see Figure 2 ) .
In embryonic mesenchyme , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 and Agouti are complementary , and it is possible that Tbx15 acts directly to inhibit Agouti <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> in dorsolateral mesenchyme .
However , the ability of Tbx15 to <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the ventral-specific Agouti isoform in postnatal mice is likely to be indirect , since postnatal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 occurs broadly along the dorsoventral axis and overlaps extensively with that of Agouti .
In either case , the targets of Tbx15 action in the skin include genes in addition to Agouti , since hair length and melanocyte <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> exhibit a demonstrable , albeit subtle , alteration in animals that carry a null Agouti allele .
One potential target is Alx4 , which , like Agouti , is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in ventral embryonic mesenchyme , and , when mutated , affects hair-follicle as well as limb and craniofacial development ( Qu et al. 1997 , 1998 ; Wu et al. 2000 ; Wuyts et al. 2000 ; Mavrogiannis et al. 2001 ) .
However , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of ventral markers such as Alx4 , as well as Alx3 and Msx2 , appears to be unaffected at E11 .5 in deH/deH embryos ( data not shown ) .
Differences and Similarities to Dorsoventral Limb Patterning .
Loss of Tbx15 also affects regional distribution of hair color in the limbs , with areas that would normally <termsem="GO:0032502"> produce </term> black hair giving rise to yellow hair instead .
However , neither normal patterns of pigment-type <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> in the limb nor their disruption in deH/deH mice correspond to obvious <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> compartments .
Furthermore , losses of function for En1 or Wnt7a , which cause a partial transformation of the distal limb from dorsum to ventrum ( Loomis et al. 1996 ) or ventrum to dorsum ( Parr and McMahon 1995 ) , respectively , have no effect on regional patterns of Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> or distribution of hair-color regions ( Y. Chen , unpublished data ) .
( Ectopic <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> of the ventral footpads that <termsem="GO:0032502"> develops </term> in En1 mutant mice is unrelated to pigment-type <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> and instead likely reflects a requirement for En1 , independent of Wnt7a , to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repress </term> migration or proliferation ( or both ) of pigment cells in ventral epidermis [ Cygan et al. 1997 ; Loomis et al. 1998 ] . )
These considerations notwithstanding , <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of dorsoventral trunk pattern by Tbx15 shares certain features with <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of dorsoventral limb patterning by Lmx1b , a LIM domain <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> that acts downstream of Wnt7a and En1 ( Riddle et al. 1995 ; Vogel et al. 1995 ; Cygan et al. 1997 ; Logan et al. 1997 ; Loomis et al. 1998 ; Chen and Johnson 2002 ) .
Both Tbx15 and Lmx1b act autonomously in mesenchymal cells to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> a dorsal identity , yet have <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domains that do not correspond to cell lineage compartments in the flank ( Tbx15 ) or the limb ( Lmx1b ) ( Altabef et al. 1997 ; Michaud et al. 1997 ) .
In the case of Lmx1b , its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the distal limb depends on Wnt7a <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> in the overlying dorsal ectoderm ( Riddle et al. 1995 ; Cygan et al. 1997 ; Loomis et al. 1998 ) .
Wnt7a , in turn , is restricted to dorsal ectoderm by En1 in the ventral ectoderm ( Loomis et al. 1996 ; Cygan et al. 1997 ; Logan et al. 1997 ) , whose <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> marks a lineage boundary coincident with the dorsoventral midline of the apical ectodermal ridge ( Altabef et al. 1997 ; Michaud et al. 1997 ; Kimmel et al. 2000 ) .
As described above , En1 or Wnt7a mutations have not been reported to affect patterns of hair-color distribution ( C. Loomis , personal communication ; Parr and McMahon 1995 ; Loomis et al. 1996 ) .
However , the essential theme that ectodermal lineage compartments <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> the fate of underlying mesenchyme in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limbs may apply to the trunk as well as the limb .
The mammary glands also <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> at a stereotyped dorsoventral position and depend on epithelial -- mesenchymal interactions .
However , the number and apparent position of the mammary glands are normal in deH/deH animals , indicating the existence of additional mechanisms that <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> <termsem="GO:0009953"> dorsoventral patterning </term> in the trunk as well as in the limbs .
These ideas are summarized in the model shown in Figure 9B .
We speculate that a diffusible signal from dorsal trunk ectoderm , at or prior to E11 .5 , <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme , which then <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishes </term> dorsal positional identity of those cells as manifested by differences in Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , pigment - <termsem="GO:0048468"> cell development </term> , and <termsem="GO:0042640"> hair growth </term> .
Because the ventral limit of Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> corresponds to the dorsal limit of En1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and because the normal position of the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary lies approximately in register with the limb-bud outgrowths , we depict the position of a putative dorsoventral boundary in trunk ectoderm as coincident with the limb dorsoventral boundary .
This model is consistent with studies in the chick , where distinct dorsal and ventral lineage compartments exist for ectoderm in both the limb ( Altabef et al. 1997 , 2000 ; Michaud et al. 1997 ; Kimmel et al. 2000 ) and interlimb regions ( Altabef et al. 1997 , 2000 ) , but not for limb mesoderm ( Altabef et al. 1997 ; Michaud et al. 1997 ) .
In fact , the same mechanism that determines dorsoventral position of the limbs and the apical ectodermal ridge may also act on <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in the trunk , since ectopic limbs <termsem="GO:0031128"> induced </term> in the interlimb region by application of FGF beads <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> along a single line that is coincident with normal limb buds ( and the future <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary ) ( Cohn et al. 1995 ; Crossley et al. 1996 ; Vogel et al. 1996 ; Altabef et al. 1997 , 2000 ) .
Our model predicts that ectopic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in ventral mesenchyme should give rise to a dorsalized <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> phenotype and could be tested with gain-of-function approaches .
However , Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is very dynamic and is restricted to dorsal mesoderm only from E11 .5 to E13 .5 .
It is possible that Tbx15 influences skin <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> in a very narrow window of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ; alternatively , <termsem="GO:0048263"> establishment of dorsal identity </term> by Tbx15 may require another as-yet-unidentified factor that is only present in the mesenchyme underlying dorsal ectoderm .
<termsem="GO:0043473"> Pigmentation </term> Patterns and Tbx15 in Other Mammals .
The lateral somitic frontier , defined as the lineage boundary between somite-derived versus lateral plate-derived mesoderm , is <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> during <termsem="GO:0001756"> somitogenesis </term> early in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( Mauger 1972 ; Christ et al. 1983 ; Olivera-Martinez et al. 2000 ; Nowicki et al. 2003 ) , but remains distinct in postnatal animals despite the potential for extensive cell mixing ( see Figure 8 ) .
However , our transplantation and fate-mapping studies demonstrate that the lateral somitic frontier lies dorsal to the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary and does not obviously correlate with a difference in skin morphology .
An additional dorsoventral domain that is not externally apparent has emerged from studies of Msx1 , whose <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> marks a subgroup of somite-derived mesenchymal cells that contribute to dermis in a narrow stripe along the paraspinal region ( Houzelstein et al. 2000 ) .
Thus , there exist at least three distinct boundaries in postnatal mammalian skin that are parallel to the sagittal plane , marked by differences in pigment-type <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> , differences in cell lineage , and differences in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Msx1 .
In rodents , only the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary is evident externally , but many mammals have more complicated patterns of hair type , length , and/or color that vary along the dorsoventral axis .
Raccoons , squirrels , skunks , and many different ungulates exhibit lateral stripes whose <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> origins have not been investigated , but may correspond to the lateral somitic frontier , the paraspinal Msx1 compartment , or an interaction between these domains .
The effect of Tbx15 on <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> in laboratory mice is reminiscent of coat-color patterns in both selected and natural populations of other mammals .
Saddle markings are common in some dog breeds , such as German shepherds , and in certain populations of Peromyscus polionotus , in which a dorsal extension of ventral depigmentation provides an adaptive advantage to subspecies that live on white sand reefs ( Blair 1951 ; Kaufman 1974 ; Belk and Smith 1996 ) .
Neither German shepherds nor deer mice have craniofacial characteristics similar to the deH mutation , but the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> patterns in these animals could represent alterations in the <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> or action of Tbx15 activity .
From the opposite perspective , the effects of Tbx15 on coat color are only apparent in certain genetic backgrounds and may not be evident at all in mammals that lack dorsoventral <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> patterns .
Studying the sequence and <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in other vertebrates may provide additional insight into patterns that affect the skeleton as well as the pigmentary system .
All mice were obtained originally from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , Maine , United States ) , except the BA strain ( Stanford Veterinary Services Center , Stanford , California , United States ) , Hoxb6-Cre transgenic mice ( kindly provided by M. Kuehn of the National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland , United States ) , mice carrying the R26R lacZ reporter allele ( kindly provided by P. Soriano , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , Washington , United States ) , and C57BL/6J ( B6 ) ae/ae mice ( kindly provided by L. Siracusa , Jefferson Medical College , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States ) .
The deH mutation arose in the 1960s in Harwell , probably on the BN strain background ( C. Beechey , personal communication ) .
We obtained deH on a B6/EiC3H background , introduced the at allele from the BTBR strain , and have maintained the line as a mixed deH / +  deH / + intercross stock with periodic outcrossing to BTBR or B6 .
For timed <termsem="GO:0007618"> matings </term> , the morning of the plug was considered E0 .5 .
Postnatally , the day of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> was considered to be P0 .5 .
For measurements of hair length and color , the entire interlimb region of skin was first dissected with a single incision at the dorsal midline and preserved with powdered sodium bicarbonate .
Slices 2 -- 2.5 mm in width were then prepared parallel to the dorsoventral axis , hair length boundaries determined from electronic images with Adobe Photoshop ( San Jose , California , United States ) , and measurements obtained using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) .
This approach samples awls and auchenes , because they are much thicker and therefore <termsem="GO:0007601"> visually </term> more predominant than zigzag underhairs .
To assess dorsoventral variation in hair-type distribution , several hundred hairs were plucked from the middorsum or midventrum of 8-wk-old male BA strain animals , then sorted and categorized using a dissection microscope .
No attempt was made to distinguish between awls and auchenes .
For skin histology , 12 m sections from paraffin-embedded tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
For DOPA staining , the dermis and epidermis were split after 3 h of incubation in 2 M sodium bromide at 37 C ( this preparation causes most hair follicles to remain with the dermis ) , individually fixed for 1 h , then rinsed and stained with 0.1 % L-DOPA ( Sigma , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) , 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 6.8 ) for 5 h at 37 C in the dark , changing the staining solution after 1 h .
The samples were then fixed overnight , dehydrated , and mounted .
This method is sufficient to stain interfollicular melanocytes without creating a high background .
The fixative used was always 4 % paraformaldehyde .
A high-resolution map for deH was generated from an intersubspecific intercross between deH/deH and CAST/Ei mice .
We initially localized deH to a 1 cM interval between D3Mit233 and D3Mit11 .
F2 animals carrying <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> chromosomes between these markers whose genotype at de was indeterminate ( deH / + or + / + ) were progeny-tested by crossing to deH/deH animals .
Further genetic mapping established a minimal region of 0.1 cM between D3Mit213 and 16 .
MMHAP32FLF1 ; these markers were used to initiate construction of a physical map with BAC genomic clones ( Research Genetics , Huntsville , Alabama , United States , and Genome Systems , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) .
End sequence from those BACs was used to <termsem="GO:0009058"> develop </term> SSCP markers M1 to M3 , as depicted in Figure 3 , and to establish a minimal physical interval of 1.4 Mb .
Primer pairs used were TTCCCTCCAATAAGTTCTGGGTACC and AAGCTTGCTGCTCTGGATTCCATTTGTAG for M1 , CCTTCATTTTTTTTTCAAGTAAAA and AAGCTTGGCTTAGTCCCAGTGGC for M2 , CCTCCAGGAAGATCTACTAGGCAC and ATGGAAAAAAAAAAGTAAGATTGAAAG for M3 , and TGGTTATCGATCTGTGGACCATTC and AAGTGAGAGAGCAGGATGGACCAC for M4 ( the M4 marker represents STS 16 .
MMHAP32FLF1 ) .
Genomic sequence and annotations were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser February 2003 assembly version mm3 ( http://genome.ucsc.edu ) ; the 1.4 Mb interval between M1 and M4 contains eight genes : four hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerases , Hsd3b3 , Hsd3b2 , Hsd3b6 , and Hsd3b1 ; an <termsem="GO:0003973"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hydroacid oxidase </term> </term> , Hao3 ; a <termsem="GO:0004830"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase </term> </term> , Wars2 ; a T-box gene , Tbx15 ; and a novel gene , 4931427F14Rik .
In the genome sequence , M1 primers correspond to AGGCCTCCAATAAGTTCTGGGTACC and AAGCTTGCTCTCTGGATTCCATTTGTAG , the M2 reverse primer corresponds to AAGCTTGGCTTTAGTCCCAGTGGGC , and the M3 primers correspond to CCTCCAGGAAGAATCTACTAGGCAC and AATGAAAAAAAAAAAAGTAAGATTGAAAG .
Minor differences among the sequences of the primers we obtained from the BAC ends and the public genome sequence may represent strain differences or sequencing errors on the BAC DNA .
A multiplex genotyping assay was developed to genotype for the deH deletion using primers GGAGCAGATCCAATTGCTTT , TCCATAGCCCATCTTCACAA , and CATGTCCACTTCTGCTTCCA .
This PCR assay <termsem="GO:0009058"> produces </term> a 392 bp product from the deH chromosome and a 595 bp product from the nonmutant chromosome .
A targeted allele of Tbx15 was <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> using the same approach described in Russ et al. ( 2000 ) .
In brief , an IRES-LacZ - <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> cassette with 5  and 3  homology arms of 3.5 kb and 1.8 kb was inserted into a unique BamHI site that lies 479 nucleotides downstream of the <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> initiation </term> site ( relative to the mRNA sequence ) in exon 3 .
Positive ES clones were injected into B6 blastocysts , and chimeric founders crossed to either B6 mice or to deH / + animals .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> was carried out on 12-m paraffin sections using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , Indiana , United States ) according to standard protocols ( Wilkinson and Nieto 1993 ) .
Embryos and postnatal skin samples were obtained from intercrosses of deH / + mice .
Embryos E13 .5 or younger were fixed for 24 h ; those older than E13 .5 and postnatal skin were fixed for 36 -- 48 h prior to embedding .
The Tbx15 probe was <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> by <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCR using primers GGCGGCTAAAATGAGTGAAC and TGCCTGCTTTGGTGATGAT ( corresponds to exons 1 and 2 ) , and the En1 probe was <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> by PCR from genomic DNA using primers ACGCACCAGGAAGCTAAAGA and AGCAACGAAAACGAAACTGG ( located in the last exon ) .
The Agouti probe corresponds to the protein-coding sequence .
( BTBR-at/at  B6-a/a ) F1 embryos at E12 .5 were dissected in sterile Tyrode 's solution , and embryonic skin was divided into dorsal , flank , and ventral pieces , each 1 -- 2 mm2 in size , as shown in Figure 7 .
Skin fragments were grafted to the testes of congenic animals as follows .
After anesthetization with 2.5 % Avertin , a 1.5-cm incision in the skin and body wall was made at a point level with the top of the limbs .
The fat pads were pulled out and laid on the outside of the body , exposing the testes .
Forceps were used to introduce a small hole in the testis capsule through which a piece of dissected embryonic skin was inserted , the testes were then replaced into the abdominal cavity , and the wound was closed in both the body wall and the skin .
After 21 days , mice that received grafts were sacrificed and the resulting hair was dissected from the testes and examined .
Fate-mapping the lateral somitic frontier .
The Hoxb6-Cre transgene described by Kuehn and colleagues ( Lowe et al. 2000 ) is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the lateral plate but not the somitic mesoderm of the trunk , beginning at E9 .5 .
Animals doubly heterozygous for this transgene and the R26R reporter gene were used as a source of whole skin at P1 .5 or P4 .5 .
Skin sections parallel to the dorsoventral axis were prepared with a single incision along the ventral midline and stained for <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> activity using standard protocols at room temperature .
The P1 .5 sample was stained overnight and the P4 .5 samples were stained for 5.5 h. Similar nonstained skin sections were prepared from animals carrying the at allele .
Images of the different skin fragments were aligned and scaled , and the relative position of the somite -- lateral plate and the <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundaries were measured using ImageJ .

Molecular Genetics of deH and Tbx15 .
( A ) Genetic and physical map , as described in the text .
Markers M1 to M3 are SSCP markers <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> from a BAC contig of the region ; marker M4 is STS 16 .
MMHAP32FLF1 and was also used as an SSCP marker .
M2 and M3 , which flank the Tbx15 and M6pr-ps on the UCSC genome browser map and lie 634 kb apart , were nonrecombinant with deH in 2340 <termsem="GO:0007126"> meioses </term> .
( B ) The deH mutation is a deletion that starts in Tbx15 intron 1 and ends in the M6pr-ps .
( C ) Sequence of deletion breakpoints .
( D ) Diagram of Tbx15LacZ allele <termsem="GO:0009058"> constructed </term> by gene targeting .
As described in the text , this allele is predicted to give rise to a protein truncated after approximately 154 codons and is lacking critical residues of the T box .
Heterozygotes for the targeted allele exhibit normal size , morphology , and hair-color patterns , but homozygotes and Tbx15LacZ/deH compound heterozygotes are identical to deH homozygotes .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmental </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Tbx15 .
( A ) At E12 .5 , transverse sections at different levels show <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in head mesenchyme ( a and b ) ; myotome , occipital , and periocular mesenchyme ( b ) ; palatal shelf , cervical sclerotome , and nasal cartilage ( c ) ; maxillary and mandibular processes ( d ) ; limbs ( e ) ; and myotome and lateral mesenchyme ( e and f ) ( scale bars = 500 m ) .
( B ) Transverse sections through the flank at different times show <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in lateral mesenchyme ( E11 .5 ) , expanding dorsally at E12 .5 , and both ventrally and dorsally at E13 .5 , detectable in loose mesenchyme underlying the dermis and the abdominal and subcutaneous muscles ( scale bar = 500 m ) .
At P3 .5 , Tbx15 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the entire dermis and is most strongly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in dermal sheaths ( scale bar = 200 m ) .
Embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Tbx15 Compared to Agouti in at/at Mice .
( A and C ) Tbx15 .
( B and D ) Agouti .
At E12 .5 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in dorsal skin is approximately complementary to that of Agouti in ventral skin .
At E14 .5 , the levels of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> for both genes are lower , but Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> has expanded ventrally and overlaps extensively with that of Agouti .
In all four panels , arrows mark the approximate ventral limit of Tbx15 and the approximate dorsal limit of Agouti ( scale bars = 500 m ) .
Effect of deH on Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> .
Comparable sections from at/at ; deH/deH and at/at ; + / + littermates .
( A ) At E14 .5 , deH/deH embryos have a smaller body cavity and loose skin within which Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> appears to be shifted dorsally , as marked by arrows ( scale bars = 500 m ) .
( B ) At P4 .5 , Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in both dorsal and ventral skin is similar in deH/deH compared to nonmutant , but in the midflank region , there is increased Agouti <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in deH/deH , especially in the upper dermis ( scale bars = 200 m ) .
Sections shown are representative of two mutant and two nonmutant samples examined at each time .
<termsem="GO:0009790"> Embryonic Establishment </term> of Dorsoventral Skin Patterning .
Pieces of skin from dorsal , flank , and ventral regions of at/a E12 .5 embryos were transplanted into the testes of congenic animals as described in the text .
Hair color of the grafts was examined 3 wk later .
Grafts of ventral embryonic skin ( n = 3 ) <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> yellow hairs , dorsal embryonic skin ( n = 4 ) <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> black hairs , and flank embryonic skin <termsem="GO:0032502"> produced </term> mostly ( 13 out of 15 ) black and yellow hairs in distinct regions as shown .
In parallel , in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> studies revealed that the embryonic flank contains the boundary of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> between Agouti and Tbx15 ( scale bars = 1 mm for hairs and 200 m for in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> results ) .
Comparison of the Dorsoventral at/at <termsem="GO:0043473"> Pigmentation </term> Boundary to the Lateral Somitic Frontier .
( A ) Dorsoventral slices of skin from at the midtrunk region prepared such that the dorsal midline lies in the center of the slice .
Sections were taken at P1 .5 ( a ) or P4 .5 ( b -- e ) from at/at or R26R / + ; Tg.Hoxb6-Cre / + mice ( the latter were stained with X-Gal ) , as described in Materials and Methods .
For purposes of comparison , images were proportionally scaled .
The boundary of X-Gal staining marks dermis derived from lateral plate versus dermis derived from mesoderm ( the lateral somitic frontier ) and lies more dorsal than the at/at <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> boundary .
( B ) Quantitation of mean (  SEM ) dorsal <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> area ( n = 5 ) and somite-derived dermis area ( n = 3 ) shows a significant difference ( p < 0.005 , t-test ) .
( C ) RNA in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> showing that Tbx15 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at E11 .5 is complementary to En1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> on the flank ( scale bars = 200 m ) .
The arrow indicates the boundary between the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> domains of the two genes .
Model for <termsem="GO:0009953"> Acquisition of Dorsoventral Patterning </term> in the Trunk and the Role of Tbx15 .
( A ) A tricolor <termsem="GO:0043473"> pigmentation </term> pattern is generated by the combination of distinct mechanisms that affect distribution of Agouti mRNA and histochemical staining for melanocytes ; effects of the latter mechanism by itself are evident in ae/ae mice ( see Figure 1 ) .
In at/at mice , reduced hair melanocyte activity and high levels of Agouti mRNA in the ventrum lead to a cream color ; as melanocyte activity gradually increases towards the dorsum , a lateral stripe is apparent on the flank .
The distributions of Agouti mRNA and histochemical staining for melanocytes are both affected by Tbx15 and are externally evident by a widening of the lateral stripe and an increased proportion of total skin occupied by the cream-colored area .
( B ) The lateral yellow stripe in at/at mice lies at the same level as the limb dorsoventral boundary .
As described in the text , we propose that distinct dorsoventral compartments in ectoderm of the trunk provide an instructional cue to the mesoderm , leading to <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tbx15 in dorsal trunk mesenchyme and acquisition of dorsal dermis character .
In the absence of Tbx15 , dorsal mesenchyme assumes ventral characteristics instead .
