<termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> Is Essential for <termsem="GO:0000792"> Heterochromatin </term> Organization in Pluripotent Embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> Cells </term> .
During mammalian development , <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> dynamics and epigenetic marking are important for genome reprogramming .
Recent data suggest an important role for the <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly machinery in this process .
To analyze the role of <termsem="GO:0033186"> <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly factor 1 </term> ( <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> ) during pre-implantation development , we generated a mouse line carrying a targeted mutation in the gene encoding its large subunit , p150CAF-1 .
Loss of p150CAF-1 in homozygous mutants leads to developmental arrest at the 16 - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage .
Absence of p150CAF-1 in these embryos results in severe alterations in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of constitutive <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> .
We provide evidence that in wild-type embryos , <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> are extensively reorganized between the two - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> and blastocyst stages .
In p150CAF-1 mutant 16 - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage embryos , the altered organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> displays similarities to the structure of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> in two - to four - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage wild-type embryos , suggesting that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is required for the maturation of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> during preimplantation development .
In embryonic stem <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , depletion of p150CAF-1 using RNA interference results in the mislocalization , loss of clustering , and decondensation of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin domains </term> .
Furthermore , loss of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in these <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> results in the alteration of epigenetic histone methylation marks at the level of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> .
These alterations of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> are not found in p150CAF-1-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts , which are <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> that are already lineage committed , suggesting that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is specifically required for <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization in pluripotent embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Our findings underline the role of the <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly machinery in controlling the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of the genome in early embryos and embryonic stem <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
<termsem="GO:0000785"> Chromatin </term> is the support of our genetic information .
It is composed of numerous repeated units called <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomes </term> , in which DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins .
Modifications in the composition and biochemical properties of <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomes </term> play major roles in the regulation of genome function .
Such modifications are termed `` epigenetic '' when they are inherited across <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> divisions and confer new information to <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> , in addition to the genetic information provided by DNA .
It is usually believed that during genome replication , the basic <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly machinery builds up `` nave '' <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomes </term> , and , in a subsequent step , <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomes </term> are selectively modified by a series of enzymes to acquire epigenetic information .
Here , the authors studied the role of a basic <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly factor ( <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> ) in mouse embryonic stem <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and early embryos .
Surprisingly , they show that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> confers epigenetic information to specific genomic regions .
In addition , this study revealed that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is required for the proper spatial organization of chromosomes in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> .
This new knowledge may contribute to better understanding the role of <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> in the maintenance of embryonic stem <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> identity and plasticity .
During mouse pre-implantation development , the genome undergoes a series of major epigenetic changes required for embryonic gene expression , the maintenance of totipotency , and the first differentiation events [ 1,2 ] .
While many studies have established the importance of DNA methylation in epigenetic reprogramming , recent data point to a crucial role of <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> in this process [ 3 -- 5 ] .
Yet we know very little about the role of histone modifying enzymes , <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> remodeling factors , and histone chaperones during pre-implantation development , or in stem <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> derived from early embryos [ 6 ] .
A subset of identified histone chaperones and <termsem="GO:0016585"> <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> remodeling complexes </term> can collaborate to promote <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosome </term> assembly in vitro and are therefore in a strategic position to control <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly and maturation during development [ 7,8 ] .
Among histone chaperones , <termsem="GO:0033186"> <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly factor 1 </term> ( <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> ) is a three-subunit ( p150 , p60 , and p48 ) <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> which promotes histone H3 and H4 deposition onto newly synthesized DNA during replication or DNA repair [ 9,10 ] .
Specifically , <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> deposits the histone H3 variant H3 .1 into <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> , in a pathway coupled to DNA synthesis , whereas a second histone chaperone , HIRA , is involved in the deposition of the H3 .3 variant in a DNA synthesis independent pathway [ 11,12 ] .
In addition to this specific <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly activity , <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> interacts with several proteins present in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> , including <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> protein 1 ( HP1 ) and MBD1 , a methyl-CpG binding domain protein that recruits histone deacetylase and repressive histone methyltransferase activities [ 13 -- 15 ] .
Furthermore , p150CAF-1 is required to ensure a replication-specific pool of HP1 molecules at replication sites in <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> during mid-late S phase [ 16 ] .
Taken together , these data suggest roles for <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in the formation of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> and in the heritability of epigenetic traits .
While the function of this evolutionary conserved histone chaperone has been studied extensively biochemically , we still lack information concerning its importance during early development in mammals and in pluripotent <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> such as embryonic stem ( ES ) <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Here , we have analyzed the importance of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> during early mouse development by genetic ablation and in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> by depletion using RNA interference ( RNAi ) .
We show that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is essential for viability in early mouse embryos and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
We provide evidence that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is required for the spatial organization and epigenetic marking of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> in pluripotent embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
We used gene targeting in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> to delete exon 3 in the Chaf1a gene , which encodes p150CAF-1 ( Figure 1A ) .
Chaf1a + /  mice were born at a Mendelian frequency , were of normal size and weight , displayed no obvious abnormalities , and were fertile .
Crossing heterozygous mice failed to generate viable newborn Chaf1a  /  mice .
Furthermore , no homozygous Chaf1a  /  embryos were detected at any of the post-implantation stages .
However , we could detect Chaf1a  /  embryos at embryonic day 4 ( E4 ) using a PCR strategy ( Figure 1B ) .
They represent only 10 % of E4 embryos obtained from Chaf1a + /  mice intercrosses , suggesting that more than half of the homozygous mutant embryos had degenerated before this stage .
Moreover , mutant embryos contained only eight to 16 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> at the E4 stage , instead of 32 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> observed for wild-type or heterozygous blastocysts ( Figure 1C and 1D ) .
Further analysis by light microscopy using immunofluorescence ( IF ) allowed us to compare wild-type and p150CAF-1-depleted embryos .
A loss of p150CAF-1 staining could not be detected before the eight - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage ( unpublished data ) suggesting that maternally contributed protein is present in the embryo up to the four - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage .
Thus , depletion of p150CAF-1 protein from this stage allows a maximum of two additional <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> divisions before developmental arrest .
Strikingly , we found that the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> appeared abnormal in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> of Chaf1a  /  embryos .
<termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> Pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> , the major component of constitutive <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> , can easily be visualized in interphase <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> by the fluorochrome DAPI and by immunostaining with HP1 [ 16,17 -- 19 ] .
In wild-type blastocysts and in mouse somatic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin domains </term> cluster together and form higher-order <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin structures </term> called <termsem="GO:0010369"> chromocenters </term> [ 20 ] , which are visualized as DAPI-dense foci ( Figure 1C ) .
These structures were not detected in Chaf1a  /  embryos ( Figure 1D ) .
Since <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> architecture and higher-order structures are important for genome function [ 21 ] , we decided to characterize this phenotype in more detail .
For this purpose , we examined the status of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization between the two - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> and blastocyst stages .
In two - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage wild-type embryos , DAPI staining is diffuse and fibrillar , with regions of higher density around the <termsem="GO:0005731"> <termsem="GO:0005730"> nucleolar </term> precursor bodies </term> ( Figure 1E ) .
<termsem="GO:0000792"> Heterochromatin domains </term> are progressively assembled into DAPI-dense foci between the four - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> and 32 - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> blastocyst stages ( Figure 1F ) .
Localization of HP1 confirmed that the structures visualized by DAPI staining correspond to constitutive <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> ( Figure 1E ) .
Thus , the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> is dramatically modified during pre-implantation development , between the two - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> and blastocyst stages .
In Chaf1a  /  E4 embryos , which are arrested between the eight - and 16 - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage , DAPI-dense foci were barely detectable ( Figure 1D ) .
Instead , DAPI staining was diffuse within the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> , with regions of higher density around the <termsem="GO:0005730"> nucleoli </term> and at the periphery of the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> ( Figure 1D ) .
Localization of HP1 showed a diffuse pattern similar to the DAPI , with some enrichment at the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> periphery , and around the <termsem="GO:0005730"> nucleoli </term> ( Figure 1D ) .
This abnormal organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> in Chaf1a  /  embryos is reminiscent of the <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization found in two - to four - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage wild-type embryos ( compare Figure 1D and 1F ) .
These data evidence a key role for p150CAF-1 during pre-implantation development , and reveal that this protein is required for the proper 3-D organization of heterochromatin within embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> .
Next , we wondered whether a similar requirement for <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> could also be observed in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , which are derived from the blastocyst inner <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> mass .
Given the early developmental arrest observed in Chaf1a  /  embryos , such <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> could not be derived directly from null embryos , and we thus used an RNAi strategy ( Figure 2A ) .
p150CAF-1 knockdown in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> was quantified by Western blot analysis and IF .
( Figure S1 ) .
p150CAF-1 RNAi-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> displayed a phenotype very similar to the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> of Chaf1a  /  E4 mice .
DAPI-dense foci were lost , and we observed diffuse HP1 and DAPI staining around the <termsem="GO:0005730"> nucleoli </term> and at the periphery of the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> ( Figure 2B ) .
This result indicates that p150CAF-1 is essential for <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> in a similar way to early pre-implantation embryos .
Surprisingly , we did not observe this severe alteration in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) following p150CAF-1 depletion by RNAi .
p150CAF-1 depletion in MEFs resulted in a strong inhibition of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> proliferation ( unpublished data ) , but did not alter the clustering of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> ( Figures 2C and S2 ) .
Similarly , p150CAF-1 depletion in 3T3 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> did not affect <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization [ 16 ] .
These observations reveal a specific function for <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in the early embryo and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
We also wondered whether loss of p150CAF-1 in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> specifically affects the <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> <termsem="GO:0044428"> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> subcompartment </term> , or whether it might result in a more global loss of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization and architecture .
We used a specific <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> against the promyelocytic leukemia ( PML ) protein to study the fate of the <termsem="GO:0016605"> PML <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> bodies </term> , which are well-characterized <termsem="GO:0044428"> subnuclear structures </term> [ 22 ] .
We could not detect any significant difference in the distribution and aspect of <termsem="GO:0016605"> PML <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> bodies </term> between control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Figure 2D ) .
These data show that <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> architecture is not globally altered following <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> loss-of-function .
In addition , Western blot analysis revealed that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> depletion did not result in altered levels of <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> architectural proteins such as histone H3 and HP1 ( Figure S1 ) .
Thus , <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is specifically required in early embryos and in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> for the proper organization of the <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> <termsem="GO:0044428"> subnuclear compartment </term> .
Previous studies performed in mammalian <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines showed that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> activity is required for S phase progression [ 16,23,24 ] .
We show here that 3 d after transfection of the RNAi vector , p150CAF-1-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( identified by a complete absence of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> IF signal ) appear still active for replication , as revealed by incorporation of the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) ( Figure 3A ) , the <termsem="GO:0005577"> PCNA </term> ( <termsem="GO:0005577"> proliferating <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> antigen </term> ) pattern ( Figure 3B ) , and flow cytometry analysis ( Figure 3C ) .
Hence , in these <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , DNA replication persists despite the drastic changes in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization .
However , 24 h later , ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> cease to proliferate and die , revealing that p150CAF-1 is required for an essential <termsem="GO:0005623"> cellular </term> process , as in embryos .
Altogether , our data demonstrate that loss of p150CAF-1 function in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and early embryos alters first the organization of heterochromatin in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> and , in a subsequent step , <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> cycle and viability .
In order to better characterize the defects in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization , we performed two-color DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) experiments to reveal the spatial distribution of pericentric and centric <termsem="GO:0005694"> chromosomal </term> regions , which in mouse are mainly composed of large blocks of major and minor satellite repeats , respectively [ 20 ] .
Pericentric domains from different <termsem="GO:0005694"> chromosomes </term> form clusters , which are revealed by FISH as large spots that coincide with DAPI-dense foci in the interphase <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> ( Figure 4A ) .
At the periphery of each <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric domain </term> , centric regions form individual entities ( Figure 4A ) .
In p150CAF-1 RNAi-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , we observed a disruption of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> clusters that coincides with the disappearance of DAPI-dense foci ( Figure 4B ) .
Individual pericentric domains from single <termsem="GO:0005694"> chromosomes </term> are now found either isolated or aggregated in a pattern less dense than the regular clusters observed in control <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Figure 4B ) .
Such aggregates , which are often found at the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> periphery , are also revealed by DAPI staining as a typical signature of p150CAF-1 loss-of-function .
Quantification of fluorescence along a line randomly drawn across the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> revealed lower fluorescence intensity and a broader distribution of DAPI and major satellite hybridization signals in p150CAF-1-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , indicating decondensation of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin domains </term> .
In contrast , centric domains showed an intensity and shape similar to control <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , suggesting that they remain unaffected by p150CAF-1 depletion ( Figure 4C and 4D ) .
In conclusion , these results show that p150CAF-1 is required for the proper condensation and clustering of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin domains </term> .
Given the known role of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in the deposition of histone H3 .1 and H4 associated with DNA synthesis [ 11,12 ] , we wondered whether this defect in higher-order <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> organization could reflect an aberrant <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomal </term> organization .
Using DNase I and micrococcal nuclease ( MNase ) assays , we could not observe any significant difference between control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> at the level of bulk genome <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> or at <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> repeats ( Figure 5 ) .
In a second series of experiments , we compared the association of histone H3 with <termsem="GO:0000790"> chromatin in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> </term> isolated from <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> transfected with control and p150CAF-1 RNAi plasmid vectors .
<termsem="GO:0005634"> Nuclei </term> were incubated in buffers with different salt concentrations ranging from 100 mM NaCl to 1 M NaCl .
In all conditions , the amount of histone H3 remaining associated with <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> was indistinguishable in control and p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( unpublished data ) .
Therefore , the loss of clustering and decondensation of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> are unlikely to be the consequence of severe defects in <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomal </term> organization .
Our findings showed that the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> localization of HP1 is severely altered in Chaf1a  /  embryos and p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
We therefore examined the status of other epigenetic marks previously shown to characterize <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> .
We first tested DNA CpG methylation [ 25 ] at major satellite repeats and found no significant difference between control and p150CAF-1-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Figure 6 ) .
As the LTM7 ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> line that we used in our RNAi experiments is a female ( XX ) <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> line , DNA methylation is globally reduced in these <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> [ 26 ] .
To rule out the possibility that hypomethylation of <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> repeats might contribute to the destabilization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> in p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , we tested our RNAi plasmid vector in a XY ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> line , and confirmed that loss of p150CAF-1 leads to disruption of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization independently of the degree of DNA methylation at <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> repeats ( unpublished data ) .
We next analyzed specific histone modifications [ 27 ] in <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments using native <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> [ 28 ] .
We found that <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric DNA </term> was immunoprecipitated with a 2-fold lower efficiency with H4K20me3 [ 29,30 ] <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> following p150CAF-1 depletion ( Figure 7A and 7B ) .
Immunoprecipitation of minor satellite repeats in the same experiment was less affected ( Figure 7B ) , showing that loss of p150CAF-1 function mainly affects H4K20me3 at <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> .
Moreover , no significant difference in immunoprecipitation efficiency was detected at intracisternal A particle ( IAP ) elements ( Figure 7B ) , which are noncentromeric repeated DNA elements also enriched in H4K20me3 [ 31 ] .
This result shows that p150CAF-1 contributes to normal levels of H4K20me3 at <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> , but not necessarily at other loci .
The H3K9me3 mark [ 32 ] was also significantly reduced in p150CAF-1-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , though to a lesser extent than H4K20me3 ( Figure 7A and 7B ) .
In wild-type <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , most of H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 signals are present at the level of DAPI-dense domains when visualized by IF [ 29 ] ( Figures 7C and 7D ) .
H3K9me3 was severely perturbed in p150CAF-1-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , displaying a diffuse pattern similar to HP1 ( Figure 7C ) .
The H4K20me3 pattern was even more severely altered , showing both a loss of the typical dots revealed in control <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and a reduction in signal intensity ( Figure 7D ) .
Consistent with our ChIP experiments , residual H4K20me3 epitopes were detected at the level of relocated DAPI-dense material .
Altogether , our results show that depletion of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> leads to a simultaneous disruption of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> 3-D organization and an alteration in epigenetic marking .
Here , we provide evidence that p150CAF-1 has a crucial function during mouse early embryogenesis and in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Previous studies showed that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is essential for the progression of DNA replication in vertebrates .
In Xenopus laevis , p150CAF-1 function is required for the rapid <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> divisions that occur during early development [ 33 ] .
Similarly , <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is essential in mammalian <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines for the progression of DNA replication [ 16,23,24,34 ] .
Our findings reveal a role for <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> during early development and in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
We show that in p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , while DNA replication initially persists without significant perturbation in <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomal </term> organization , severe <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization defects can be observed .
Loss of p150CAF-1 did not affect <termsem="GO:0016605"> PML bodies </term> in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> , showing that <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> architecture is not generally altered .
Ultimately , p150CAF-1 depletion results in the arrest of ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> division and <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> death .
Given the major defects observed in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization , it is tempting to speculate that these defects cause the developmental arrest in the embryos and death in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
The role of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> includes spatial localization , condensation , and clustering of <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric domains </term> .
This important function of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> was not revealed in primary MEFs , 3T3 <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , or human <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> lines , suggesting that it is specific of pluripotent embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Alternatively , early embryos and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , whose genome is more plastic than somatic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , might represent a particularly sensitive context in which the importance of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization is exacerbated .
In ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , major architectural <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> proteins are hyperdynamic and bind relatively loosely to <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> [ 35 ] .
In this <termsem="GO:0005623"> cellular </term> context , our findings show that proper <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> architecture relies on <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> function .
In contrast , in undifferentiated <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> that are already lineage committed ( such as MEFs ) genome architecture might be more stable than in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> and thus can not be disrupted by <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> depletion .
This important function of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> in pluripotent embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> could be partially conserved during evolution .
Indeed , in Arabidopsis thaliana , in which <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is not essential for viability [ 36 ] , loss of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is associated with a mild alteration in <termsem="GO:0010369"> chromocenter </term> size [ 37 ] .
This phenotype is somehow reminiscent of loss of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> - mediated defects in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization in early mouse embryos .
In mouse ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , we show that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is also required for regular levels of H4K20me3 at <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> repeats , but not at IAP elements , which are repeated sequences spread all over the mouse genome .
These data suggest that proper <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization and epigenetic marking of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> are coupled in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Alternatively , 3-D organization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> and epigenetic marking might represent two independent functions of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> .
The variable requirement for <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> across species might reflect the acquisition of new properties affecting the function of histone H3 variants during evolution of eukaryotes .
<termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is essential in mammals but dispensable in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 38 ] .
Interestingly , the budding yeast genome does not contain <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin regions </term> equivalent to those of higher eukaryotes , and several hallmark features of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> such as di - and trimethylation at H3K9 , H3K27 , and H4K20 are not observed in the silent <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> of S. cerevisiae .
In mammals , H3K9 dimethylation is predominantly associated with H3 .1 , but not with H3 .3 , which carries modifications typically found in transcribed <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin regions </term> [ 39 ] .
Outside of the centromeric H3 variant , S. cerevisiae possesses only H3 .3 , which is expressed and incorporated into <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> in a replication-independent fashion in higher eukaryotes [ 12 ] .
These data suggest a specific role for H3 .1 in <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin regions </term> .
We show here that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> , which is a H3 .1 replication-dependent loading <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> [ 11 ] , is specifically required for the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of <termsem="GO:0005721"> <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric </term> heterochromatin </term> in embryos and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
One possibility would be a scenario in which incorporation of H3 .1 into <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> is required for the proper <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of constitutive <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> in an embryonic context .
While this has to be addressed experimentally , it is worthwhile to mention an alternate possible mechanism that might explain the disruption of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> in p150CAF-1 null embryos and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
<termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> could be required for the loading , into <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> , of an interacting partner required for the clustering of <termsem="GO:0000775"> pericentric domains </term> .
Following one or two rounds of DNA replication in the absence of p150CAF-1 , <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> would become deprived of this molecule , which would cause the disruption of its 3-D organization .
A potential candidate is the HP1 protein , which interacts with <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> [ 13,16 ] .
In agreement with a recent report [ 40 ] , our analysis of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> in pre-implantation embryos has revealed drastic changes in <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization between the two - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> and blastocyst stages .
Cloning experiments in mouse revealed that the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization of heterochromatin in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> was quickly reverted into the one - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage-specific form after <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> transfer [ 40 ] .
Hence , remodeling of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> 3-D organization parallels <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> reprogramming toward an early embryonic status in cloned embryos .
This drastic reorganization of <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> organization is similar to that observed in p150CAF-1-depleted ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , and in developmentally arrested 16 - <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> stage Chaf1a  /  embryos .
These data show that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> is involved in setting up proper <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin </term> architecture during the first <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> divisions of embryonic life .
Given the importance of <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclear </term> organization in the control of gene expression [ 21,41 ] , this finding suggests that <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> contributes to the coordinated programs of gene expression during early embryogenesis .
Our findings open new perspectives in the understanding of <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> dynamics during early development and in pluripotent embryonic <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
While most studies focused on the role of DNA methylation and histone modifying enzymes [ 3 ] , our data point to the importance of the <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> assembly machinery .
We show that in addition to assembling <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomes </term> , <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> provides spatial and epigenetic information to <termsem="GO:0000792"> heterochromatin domains </term> in early embryos and ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .
Generation of Chaf1a mutant mice and embryos .
Using PCR , we amplified two genomic fragments ( about 3 kb each ) flanking Chaf1a exon 3 .
These DNA fragments were assembled by conventional cloning with the neomycin and DT ( diphtheria toxin ) cassettes , as described in Figure 1A .
The construct was transfected in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> by electroporation .
We identified recombinant ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> carrying the mutant Chaf1atm1Ger ( abbreviated Chaf1a  in the manuscript ) allele by Southern blot ( Figure 1A ) .
We derived Chaf1a + /  mice by injecting recombined ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> into C57BL/6N blastocysts .
E4 embryos obtained from the intercross of Chaf1a + /  mice were genotyped by nested-PCR amplification .
Embryos were collected in a PCR reaction mix containing oligonucleotide primers 1 , 2 , and 3 ( Figure 1A ) that amplify the wild-type and mutant alleles .
After 30 cycles of amplification , 1 l of each PCR reaction was used in a second round of PCR amplification with a new set of oligonucleotide primers .
After 30 cycles of amplification , PCR reactions were run onto an agarose gel , which revealed the presence of the wild-type ( 150 bp ) and recombinant ( 200 bp ) alleles .
P150CAF-1 depletion by RNAi .
The RNAi plasmid vector that we used in this study contains the mouse H1 promoter and a puromycin selection gene ( SB and MG , unpublished data ) .
We characterized in detail the properties of this new vector using a GFP target gene and FACS : Extinction of target genes in ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> is highly efficient in 70 % of the <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , of intermediate efficiency in 15 % , and inefficient in the remaining 15 % of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> analysis .
The sequence of p150CAF-1 siRNA ( short interfering RNA ) duplex [ 16 ] was cloned into this plasmid .
The control vector expressed a siRNA that targets GFP RNA degradation .
ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> were transfected by electroporation with the RNA plasmid vector , seeded onto gelatin-coated slides , and cultured for 24 h in the absence of selection .
Puromycin ( 2 g/ml ) was added to the culture medium and <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> were cultured for an additional 48-h period .
Using the p150CAF-1 RNAi vector , IF microscopy quantification reveals a complete <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> depletion in most <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> ( Figure S1B ) .
Western blot analysis ( Figure S1A ) reveals residual p150CAF-1 expression , as expected from the 15 % of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> that do not inhibit the target gene .
MEFs ( passage 3 , 90 % confluence ) were transfected during 4 h with the RNAi plasmid vector using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogene , Carlsbad , California , United States ) according to manufacturer 's conditions .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cells </term> were trypsinized , plated at 1/3 dilution , and cultured for 48 h in the presence of puromycin .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cell </term> lines .

Primary MEFs were derived from E13 embryos as described in [ 43 ] .
Immunofluorescence .
<termsem="GO:0005623"> Cells </term> were fixed for 20 min in PBS with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and immunodetection was performed as previously described [ 44 ] .
E4 embryos were collected and treated with tyrode acid to remove the zona pellucida , deposited onto microscope slides , and processed for immunostaining as described for ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> .

<termsem="GO:0019814"> Antibodies </term> anti-mouse p150CAF1 [ 16 ] and anti-H3K9me3 ( Upstate Biotechnology ) were used at 1/250 and 1/500 , respectively .

DNA FISH .
Probes were described previously [ 20 ] .
Biotin-16-dUTP or Digoxigenin-11-dUTP ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) labeled probes were generated by nick translation ( Roche ) and FISH performed as described [ 20 ] .
Image acquisition was performed with the Deltavision RT microscope ( 100  , 1.4 NA objective ) , images were deconvoluted , and fluorescence profiles measured along an arbitrary line using SoftWorx .
<termsem="GO:0005634"> Nuclei </term> preparation , nuclease digestion , and biochemical analysis of <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> .
ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> were incubated on ice for 10 min in buffer 1 ( 15 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 0.3 M sucrose , 60 mM KCl , 15 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM EGTA ) with 0.15 % IGEPAL ( Sigma , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) .
<termsem="GO:0005634"> Nuclei </term> were purified by centrifugation ( 10,000  g for 30 min , at 4 C ) on sucrose cushions ( buffer 1 with 1.2 M sucrose ) and resuspended in nuclease buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl [ pH 7.5 ] , 20 mM NaCl , 0.32 M sucrose , 4 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM CaCl2 ) .
About 2.106 <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> were incubated with increasing quantities of MNase ( 0.04 -- 1.6 units ) or DNase I ( 0.25 -- 16 units ) .
Digestion time at 37 C was 10 min for MNase and 2 min for DNase I. Digestions were stopped by adding SDS to 1 % and EDTA to 50 mM .
DNAs were prepared by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation .
To test the association of histone H3 with <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> in control and p150-depleted <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> , isolated <termsem="GO:0005634"> nuclei </term> were incubated on ice for 30 min in buffer 2 ( 50 mM Hepes [ pH7 .9 ] , 20 % Glycerol , 3 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 % IGEPAL , 0.5 mM DTT , 0.5 mM PMSF ) supplemented with either 0.1 M , 0.3 M , 0.45 M , 0.7 M , or 1 M NaCl .

ChIP .
We prepared native <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> fragments of two to six <termsem="GO:0000786"> nucleosomes </term> in length as described [ 28 ] .
5 g of <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin </term> were incubated overnight with 10 l of commercial <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibodies </term> .
After incubation with protein-G sepharose and three washes , immunoprecipitated DNA was purified , sized onto an agarose gel , and analyzed by Southern blot .
Hybridization signals were quantified using an Instant Imager ( PerkinElmer , Wellesley , California , United States ) .
<termsem="GO:0019814"> Antibodies </term> specific for H4K20me3 were purchased from Abcam .
<termsem="GO:0019814"> Antibodies </term> for H3K9me3 were purchased from both Abcam and Upstate Biotechnology and gave similar results .
For Southern blot analysis , we used a 240-bp EcoRI/BamHI fragment from pSAT ( major satellite probe ) [ 45 -- 47 ] and a 360-bp EcoRI/HindIII fragment from R198 , corresponding to three copies of the 120-bp minor satellite repeat [ 49 ] .
Probes used in FISH experiments were described in [ 46 -- 48 ] .
The probe for IAP elements was described in [ 50 ] .
Analysis of p150CAF-1 Depletion by RNAi with Western Blot and IF .
( A ) Western blot analysis of ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> transfected with control ( cont ) or p150CAF-1 ( p150 ) RNAi plasmid vectors .
-actin was used as a loading control .
Amount of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> used in each lane is indicated .
p150CAF-1 knockdown does not significantly affect HP1 , histone H3 , or H3K9me3 levels .
( B ) IF analysis .
ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> transfected with control ( cont ) or p150CAF-1 ( p150 ) siRNA vector were immunostained with p150CAF-1 <termsem="GO:0019814"> antibody </term> ( green ) and DAPI ( blue ) .
Scale bar = 5 m .
Fluorescence was quantified along a line drawn across the <termsem="GO:0005634"> nucleus </term> and data were plotted , revealing efficient p150CAF-1 depletion by RNAi .
The apparent difference in the efficiency of <termsem="GO:0033186"> CAF-1 </term> knockdown revealed by Western blot and IF likely reflects the observation that the RNAi plasmid vector used in this study is efficient in 85 % of the transfected ES <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> population , whereas 15 % of <termsem="GO:0005623"> cells </term> display no inhibition of the target gene ( see Materials and Methods ) .
