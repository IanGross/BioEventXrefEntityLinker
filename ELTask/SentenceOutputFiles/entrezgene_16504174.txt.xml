Identification and targeted disruption of the mouse gene encoding <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> ( <termsem="EG:434423"> PH34 </term> / <termsem="EG:434423"> ECAT2 </term> / <termsem="EG:434423"> DPPA5 </term> ) .
Embryonic stem cell-specific gene ( ESG ) 1 , which encodes a KH-domain containing protein , is specifically expressed in early embryos , germ cells , and embryonic stem ( ES ) cells .
Previous studies identified genomic clones containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and five pseudogenes .
However , their chromosomal localizations or physiological functions have not been determined .
A Blast search of mouse genomic databases failed to locate the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene .
We identified several bacterial artificial clones containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and an additional <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - like sequence with a similar gene structure from chromosome 9 .
The <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - like sequence contained a multiple critical mutations , indicating that it was a duplicated pseudogene .
The 5 ' flanking region of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene , but not that of the pseudogene , exhibited strong enhancer and promoter activity in undifferentiated ES cells by luciferase reporter assay .
To study the physiological functions of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene , we replaced this sequence in ES cells with a -geo cassette by homologous recombination .
Despite specific expression in early embryos and germ cells , <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - mice developed normally and were fertile .
We also generated <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells both by a second independent homologous recombination and directly from blastocysts derived from heterozygous intercrosses .
Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> in these cells .
These ES cells demonstrated normal morphology , proliferation , and differentiation .
The <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene , together with a duplicated pseudogene , is located on chromosome 9 .
Despite its specific expression in pluripotent cells and germ cells , <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> is dispensable for self-renewal of ES cells and establishment of germcells .
Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells were first derived from the blastocysts of mice in 1981 [ 1,2 ] and humans in 1998 [ 3 ] .
ES cells have two important properties : theability to maintain pluripotency , which is the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells , and rapid proliferation .
These characteristics make mouse ES cells an essential component of gene targeting technology .
These qualitiesalso make human ES cells attractive sources for cell transplantation therapy to treat various diseases , including spinal cord injuries and juvenile diabetes .
The molecular mechanisms underlying the pluripotency and rapid proliferation of ES cells are currently a major focus of the field of stem cell biology [ 4-6 ] .
To identify molecules essential in ES cells for these properties , several groups have utilized transcriptome analyses to identify genes specifically expressed in ES cells and early embryos .
These analyses , including DNA microarray analyses [ 7 ] and expressed sequence tag analyses [ 8-12 ] , identified several common transcripts , including ESG1 that was also designated dppa5 or ECAT2 .
ESG1 was originally identified as a transcript Ph34 that was down-regulated by retinoic acid in embryonic carcinoma cells [ 13 ] .
The expression of this gene was confined in mice to early embryos and germ cells [ 14 ] .
It is also expressed in pluripotent cells , including ES cells , embryonic germ cells , and multipotent germline stem cells [ 15 ] .
ESG1 encodes a polypeptide of 118 amino acids that contains a single KH domain , which is an RNA-binding domain [ 16 ] .
It remains unclear , however , if <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> functions as an RNA-binding protein or the roles it plays in ES cells and mice .
Previous genomic library screening by identified genomic clones containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and seven pseudogenes [ 17 ] .
Two of these pseudogenes exhibit a similar exon-intron structure as the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene , indicating their generation by gene duplication .
The five remaining pseudogenes did not contain any introns , indicating that these were generated by retrotransposition of ESG1 transcripts .
The chromosomal localizations of the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and pseudogenes , however , have not been reported .
In this study , we determined the structure of the mouse gene encoding this protein and related pseudogenes .
We also performed gene targeting to determine the physiological function of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> .
Chromosomal localization and structures of <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and psedogenes .
To determine the chromosomal localizations of the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and pseudogenes , we performed a Blast analysis of the mouse genomic database with the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> cDNA sequence as a query .
We identified several putative pseudogenes without introns on chromosomes 1 , 5 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 17 , and X ( Figure 1 ) .
In addition , two intron-less pseudogenes were identified in DNA fragments for which the chromosomal localization remained unmapped .
While these pseudodgenes have significant homology to <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> cDNA , they could not produce functional proteins , because of critical mutations .
This result suggests that there are a larger number of intron-less pseudogenes than previously anticipated .
Existence of multiple retropseudogenes is a hallmark of pluripotent cell-specific genes [ 18 ] .
ESG1pseudogenes identified by a Blast search of mouse genomic databases .
Substitution mutations are indicated by black lines .
Intron-like gap sequences are indicated with triangles .
Chromosomal localizations are shown on the right .
On chromosome 9 , we identified a DNA fragment similar to the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene that included two putative introns .
These putative first and second exons , however , contained ( 4 ) multiple mutations of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> cDNA sequence .
The putative third exon was identical to that of the previously reported <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene .
Also on chromosome 9 , we identified another DNA fragment that was similar , but not identical , to the third exon of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene .
These findings suggest that these <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - like sequences on chromosome 9 have not been correctly assembled .
To obtain DNA fragments containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene , we screened the bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) DNA pool by PCR using primer pairs that would only amplify the real gene , not the pseudogenes .
We obtained two independent , but overlapping BAC clones .
Southern blot analyses and sequencing demonstrated that these clones contained a sequence exhibiting complete identity with <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> cDNA that was interrupted by two putative introns ( Figure 2A ) .
The two intron sequences begin with GT and terminate with AG , fulfilling the GT-AG rule of exon-intron junctions [ 19 ] .
The 5 ' flanking region of this DNA fragment exhibited strong promoter/enhancer activity by luciferase reporter assays in undifferentiated ES cells , but not in somatic cells ( Figure 3 ) .
The same fragment showed much weaker activity after induction of differentiation by retinoic acid .
We concluded that this sequence is the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene .
BAC clones containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene and a duplication pseudogene ( PS ) .
A ) Localization of the gene and PS on chromosome 9 .
B ) Sequence comparison of the gene and PS revealed that these are homologous from eight base pairs upstream of the first exon to 675 bp downstream of the third exon .
Substitution mutations are indicated by black lines .
The insertion is indicated by an open triangle .
Promoter/enhancer activity of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene and pseudogene .
DNA fragments of ~ 6 kbp isolated from the 5 ' flanking regions of the gene and PS were transferred into luciferase reporter plasmids .
We introduced the reporter genes into undifferentiated ES cells ( open columns ) , retinoic acid-treated ES cells ( grey columns ) , and NIH3T3 cells ( closed columns ) .
Data represent the averages and standard deviations of three independent experiments .
We also found that the two BAC clones contained another <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - like sequence ( Figure 2A ) .
The two sequences , separated by a 68 kbp intergenic sequence , were oriented in opposite directions .
The <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - like sequence exhibited greater than 95 % identity to the exons and introns of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene .
This sequence , however , contained critical nucleotide substitutions in all of the exons and one nucleotide insertion in exon 2 ( Figure 2B ) .
Although 675 base pairs of the 3 ' flanking regions were conserved between the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene and the pseudogene , only five base pairs of the 5 ' flanking region were identical .
This 5 ' flanking region ( ~ 6 kbp ) did not possess any promoter/enhancer activity in luciferase reporter assays ( Figure 3 ) .
It is thus unlikely that this sequence is transcribed or translated into a functional protein .
This sequence likely represents a duplication pseudogene .
Bierbaum previously reported the existence of two pseudogenes with similar exon-intron organization as the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene [ 17 ] .
We could not determine which of these two pseudogenes corresponds to the one we identified or the location of the remaining pseudogene .
Targeted disruption of the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene .
To study the function of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> , we deleted the gene by homologous recombination in mouse ES cells .
We replaced the three exons with either a fusion of the neomycin-resistance and -galactosidase genes ( -geo ) or the hygromycin resistant gene ( HygR ) using two targeting vectors ( Figure 4A ) introduced into RF8 ES cells by electroporation .
We obtained eight ES cell clones with correct homologous recombination of the -geo targeting vector , which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis ( Figure 4B ) .
We obtained only one clone with correct homologous recombination of the HygR targeting vector .
Targeted disruption of the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene .
A ) Targeting strategy .
Homologous regions are indicated by thick lines .
Recognition sites of PstI ( P ) and SpeI ( S ) , which were used for Southern blot analyses , are shown .
The gene encoding <termsem="EG:2650491"> diphtheria toxin </term> A ( DTA ) was inserted at the 3 ' end of the targeting vectors to facilitate negative selection .
B ) Southern blot analyses confirming homologous recombination .
WT , wild-type ES cells ;  , -geo + / - ES cells ; H , HygR + / - ES cells ; - / - , <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells .
Numbers indicate clone numbers .
C ) Northern blot ( upper ) and western blot ( lower ) analyses of wild-type ES cells ( WT ) , <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells ( - / - , three clones ) and heterozygous ES cells ( + / - ) .
Northern blot was performed as previously described [ 20 ] .
To confirm the loading of equal amounts of RNA , ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNA is also shown ( middle ) .
To obtain homozygous mutant ES cells , we introduced the -geo vector into HygR heterozygous ES cells .
Of 105 G418-resistant colonies tested , 49 were homozygous for <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> deletion .
Northern blot and western blot analyses confirmed the absence of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> in these cells ( Figure 4C ) .
In 29 clones , the -geo vector had replaced the HygR vector , such that the cells remained heterozygous .
In the remaining 27 clones , the -geo vector was integrated at non-homologous sites .
<termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells exhibited normal morphology ( Figure 5A ) .
These cells also proliferated at a speed comparable to that of the control ( heterozygous and wild-type ) cells ( Figure 5B ) .
<termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - cells differentiated normally after the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor ( Figure 5B ) or retinoic acid treatment ( not shown ) .
When transplanted into hind flanks of nude mice , these cells produced teratomas , tumors containing components of all three germ layers ( Figure 5C ) .
These results indicate that <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> is dispensable for the self-renewal properties and pluripotency of ES cells .
Analyses of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells .
A ) The morphology of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cell colonies grown on STO feeder cells .
B ) Growth curve of wild-type ( WT ) , <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ( - / - ) and heterozygous ( + / - ) ES cells .
Each clone ( 1  104 cells/well ) was plated in 24-well plates .
Cell numbers were determined with a Coulter counter at 2 , 4 , and 6 days .
Data of + / - and - / - cells are shown as averages and standard deviations of three independent clones .
C ) A section of teratoma derived from <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells ( hematoxylin & eosin staining ) .
We examined the gene expression profiles of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells using oligonucleotide-based DNA microarrays representing ~ 20,000 genes .
In comparison to control ES cells , <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> was identified as the gene reduced to the greatest extent in <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells ( Figure 6A ) .
The expression of ES cell marker genes , such as <termsem="EG:71950"> Nanog </term> and <termsem="EG:18999"> Oct3/4 </term> , was normal in <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells .
We confirmed normal <termsem="EG:18999"> Oct3/4 </term> expression at protein levels by Western blot ( Figure 6B ) .
The overall gene expression profiles were similar between control ES cells and <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells .
Several genes exhibited a greater than two-fold reduction in <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - cells , including <termsem="EG:16678"> Krt1 </term> -8 , <termsem="EG:18617"> Pem </term> , <termsem="EG:14219"> Ctgf </term> , <termsem="EG:19225"> Ptgs2 </term> , <termsem="EG:16002"> Igf2 </term> and <termsem="EG:16323"> Inhba </term> .
These genes might be regulated directly or indirectly by <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> .
Since <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> contains a KH-type RNA-binding domain , it may stabilize mRNA of these genes .
Further studied are required to clarify this possibility .
Gene expression analyses of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells .
A ) DNA microarray analyses .
Total RNA from wild-type ES cells and <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 , respectively .
Samples were hybridized to Agilent Mouse Developmental Microarrays .
The averages of two independent clones are shown .
B ) Western blot analyses .
Cell lysates from <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> + / - and <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - cells were examined for expression of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> , <termsem="EG:18999"> Oct3/4 </term> and <termsem="EG:12567"> CDK4 </term> with immunoblotting .
To generate <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - knockout mice , we injected -geo - <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> + / - ES cell clones into the blastocysts of C57BL6 mice .
We obtained germline transmission from three clones .
We obtained <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - mice at the Mendelian ratios ( 36 wild-type , 69 <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> + / - , and 45 <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ) from intercrosses of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> + / - mice .
These animals exhibited normal development , gross appearance , and fertility ( not shown ) .
Histological examination of testis and ovary could not identify any abnormalities ( not shown ) .
These data demonstrated that <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> is dispensable for both mouse development and germ cell formation .
We also generated ES cells from blastocysts obtained by intercrosses of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> + / - males and <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - females .
Of the eight ES cell lines established , two clones were <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - .
These <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - null ES cells demonstrated normal morphology , proliferation , and differentiation ( not shown ) , confirming that <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> is dispensable in ES cells .
To analyze the physiological roles of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> , we identified the mouse gene on chromosome 9 and deleted it by homologous recombination in ES cells .
Despite specific expression in early embryos , germ cells , and pluripotent cells , our data demonstrated that <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> is dispensable for mouse development , germ cell formation , and ES cell self-renewal .
Identification and analyses of BAC clones containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene .
To identify bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) clones containing <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene , we performed PCR-based screening of mouse BAC library DNA pools ( Research Genetics ) using the <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - u38 ( 5 ' - GAAGTCTGGTTCCTTGGCAGG-3 ' ) and <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - L394 ( 5 ' - ACTCGATACACTGGCCTAGC-3 ' ) primers .
Following restriction enzyme digestion , we performed Southern blot analyses of BAC clones as described [ 20 ] using the <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - U258 ( 5 ' - CTCGAGTGTACAGTCAAGTGGTTGCTGGGA-3 ' ) , <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - U65 ( 5 ' - GTGACCCTCGTGACCCGTAA-3 ' ) , <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - intron1L ( 5 ' - CTGCGTGAGAGAAACACCAAACAGGC-3 ' ) , pH34-L545 ( 5 ' - TGTGAATGGGAAGGTTACCACTCT-3 ' ) and <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - SCL1 ( 5 ' - GCCCTCTTCTGGTTTGTCTCGAAAT-3 ' ) probes .
Hybridization with these probes revealed bands containing either the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene or pseudogenes .
To sequence the region containing the <termsem="EG:434423"> mouse ESG1 </term> gene and the 3 ' flanking region , we subcloned a ~ 15 kbp XhoI-SalI fragment into the pZERO-2 vector ( Invitrogen ) .
HindIII - or EcoRI-digested fragments of this vector were then cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) for sequencing .
To sequence the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> pseudogene and the 3 ' flanking region , an 8 kbp NotI/XhoI fragment was cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) .
BamHI - or PstI - fragments of this vector were also cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) .
To identify the sequence containing the 5 ' flanking regions of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene and the related pseudogenes , we used a TOPO walker kit ( Invitrogen ) with the <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - T2L ( 5 ' - ACTAGTCGCAGCAGGGATCCAGGAATATCT-3 ' ) and <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - L394 primers .
The resulting sequence was cloned into pCR2 .1 ( Invitrogen ) .
We obtained a ~ 6 kbp band from the NsiI-digensted library ; XbaI - , SpeI - , EcoRI - , and PstI-digested fragments of this band were cloned into pBluescript KS ( - ) for sequencing .
This fragment contained the 5 ' flanking region of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> gene .
A ~ 3 kbp fragment , obtained from the SacI-digested library , was cloned into pCR2 .1 for sequencing .
This fragment was contained the 5 ' region flanking the pseudogene .
Construction of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> targeting vectors .
We replaced all of the <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> exons with two targeting vectors containing either an IRES--geo cassette [ 21 ] or an IRES-HygR cassette by promoter trap selection .
We amplified the 5 ' arm ( 1.8 kbp ) using KOD plus ( TOYOBO ) with the <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - targetpair5-U ( 5 ' - CCGCGGAAAGTCAAGAGATTGGGTGG-3 ' ) and <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - targetpair5-L ( 5 ' - GCGGCCGCCTTTACGGGTCACGAGGGTCAC-3 ' ) primers .
The 3 ' arm ( 5.8 kbp ) was amplified using the <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - targetpair3-U ( 5 ' - TGTGGCCAGTGTTTGGTTCTGGCGGG-3 ' ) and <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - targetpair3-L ( 5 ' - CTCGAGGACTCGCCATTCTAGCCAAG-3 ' ) primers .
The IRES -geo or IRES HygR cassettes were ligated in between the two PCR fragments .
The <termsem="EG:2650491"> diphtheria toxin </term> A cassette was placed downstream of the 3 ' arm .
After linearization with SacII , these targeting vectors were electroporated into 2.0  107 RF8 ES cells [ 22 ] using a Gene pulser ( BIORAD ) .
Transfected cells were selected with 250 g/mL G418 or 100 g/mL hygromycin B , respectively .
Genomic DNA from G418 - or hygromycin B-resistant colonies was screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting .
Southern blot screening for homologous recombination .
ES cells genomic DNA was extracted with PUREGENE  Cell Lysis Solution ( Gentra systems ) .
For 5 ' Southern blot analysis , genomic DNA was first digested with PstI , then separated on an 0.8 % agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane as described [ 20 ] .
A 560 bp 5 ' probe was amplified using the ESG1S5 ( 5 ' - GATGGTGGTGGTGACTCAGAG -3 ' ) and ESG1AS5 as ( 5 ' - CCTCCATTGCCTCTATATCAG -3 ' ) primers .
The probe specifically labeled an 18 kbp band from the wild-type locus , a 15 kbp band from the -geo locus , and a 12 kbp band from the HygR locus .
Genomic DNA was also digested with SpeI for 3 ' Southern blot analysis .
A 1,010 bp 3 ' probe was amplified with the pH34U-8000 ( 5 ' - CCAACCAGCCAGAGTTTCAGTTAT -3 ' ) and pH34L-9000 ( 5 ' - GATAAGCTGCTGCCAAAAGACAAG -3 ' ) primers .
The probe hybridized to an 11.5 kbp band from the wild-type locus , a 12.5 kbp band from the -geo locus , and a 9.5 kbp band from the HygR locus .
Generation of anti- <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> polyclonal antibodies .
The coding sequence of <termsem="EG:434423"> Esg1 </term> was amplified by PCR with the <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - gw-s ( 5 ' - AAAAAGCAGGCTGGATGATGGTGACCCTCGTGA-3 ' ) and <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> - gw-as ( 5 ' - AGAAAGCTGGGTCTGCATCCAGGTCGGAGACA-3 ' ) primers .
To construct pDONR - <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> , the resulting PCR product was subcloned into pDONR201 ( Invitrogen ) .
pDONR - <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> was interacted with pDEST17 ( Invitrogen ) by LR recombination .
After introduction of the resulting expression vector pDEST17 - <termsem="EG:434423"> pH34 </term> into BL21-AI E. coli ( Invitrogen ) , recombinant protein production was induced according to the manufacture 's protocol .
Histidine-tagged <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose ( Qiagen ) under denaturing conditions in the presence of 8 M urea .
After dialysis against 6 M urea , the recombinant proteins were injected into New Zealand White rabbits to generate anti- <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> polyclonal antibodies .
After preparation of ES cell extracts with M-Per ( Pierce ) , cellular proteins were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) -14 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Millipore ) .
Membranes were incubated with anti- <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> ( 1/500 dilution ) , anti-Oct3 / 4 ( 1/500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti-CDK4 ( 1/200 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and anti-GFP ( 1/1000 ; MBL ) primary antibodies .
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulins ( 1/5000 ; Cell Signaling ) were used to detect antibody binding .
We visualized bound antibody with an ECL Western Blotting Detection System ( Amersham ) .
Derivation of <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - deficient ES cells from blastocysts .
<termsem="EG:434423"> Esg1 </term> + / - or <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - mutant female mice were injected with Tamoxifen ( 10 g ) and Depo-provera ( 1 mg ) subcutaneously on the third day of pregnancy .
Four days later , embryos in diapause were flushed out of the uterus and cultured on STO feeder cells in four-well plates in Dulbecco 's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 20 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( Hyclone ) , 0.1 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids ( Invitrogen ) , 2 mM L-glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , 50 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomysin ( Invitrogen ) , and 0.11 mM 2-mercaptoethanol ( Invitrogen ) .
After six days , the central mass of each explant was harvested , rinsed in PBS , and placed in a drop of trypsin for a few minutes .
The cell mass was collected with a finely drawn-out Pasteur pipette preloaded with medium , ensuring minimal carryover of the trypsin .
The cells were gently transfered into a fresh well with 20 % FBS-containing medium .
The resulting primary ES cell colonies were individually passaged into wells of four-well plates containing STO feeder cell layers .
Thereafter , cells were expanded by trypsinization of the entire culture .
Total RNA from wild-type ES cells and <termsem="EG:434423"> ESG1 </term> - / - ES cells was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 , respectively .
