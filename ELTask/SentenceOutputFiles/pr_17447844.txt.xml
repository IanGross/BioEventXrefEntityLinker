A Mammal-Specific Doublesex Homolog Associates with Male Sex Chromatin and Is Required for Male Meiosis .
Gametogenesis is a sexually dimorphic process requiring profound differences in germ cell differentiation between the sexes .
In mammals , the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in males creates additional sex-specific challenges , including incomplete X and Y pairing during meiotic prophase .
This triggers formation of a heterochromatin domain , the XY body .
The XY body disassembles after prophase , but specialized sex chromatin persists , with further modification , through meiosis .
Here , we investigate the function of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> , a mammal-specific protein related to the invertebrate sexual regulators Doublesex and MAB-3 .
We find that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> preferentially localizes to the XY body in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and is required for male meiosis .
In <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants , meiotic pairing and recombination appear normal , and a transcriptionally silenced XY body with appropriate chromatin marks is formed , but most germ cells undergo apoptosis during pachynema .
A minority of mutant cells can progress to diplonema , but many of these escaping cells have abnormal sex chromatin lacking histone H3K9 di - and trimethylation and <termsem="PR:000005082"> heterochromatin protein 1 </term> accumulation , modifications that normally occur between pachynema and diplonema .
Based on the localization of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> to the XY body and the sex chromatin defects observed in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants , we conclude that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> plays a role in the sex chromatin transformation that occurs between pachynema and diplonema .
We suggest that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> may help control the transition from meiotic sex chromosome inactivation to postmeiotic sex chromatin in males .
In addition , because it is found in all branches of mammals , but not in other vertebrates , <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> may shed light on evolution of meiosis and of sex chromatin .
Genes related to the sexual regulator Doublesex of Drosophila have been found to control sexual development in a wide variety of animals , ranging from roundworms to mammals .
In this paper , we investigate the function of the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> gene , one of seven related genes in the mouse .
Female mammals are XX and males are XY , a chromosomal difference that presents specific challenges during the meiotic phase of male germ cell development .
Some of these are thought to be overcome by incorporating the X and Y chromosomes into a specialized structure called the XY body .
We find that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein is present in germ cells , localizes to the male XY body during meiosis , and is essential for male but not female fertility .
The XY body normally is altered by recruitment of additional proteins and by specific modifications to histone proteins between the pachytene and diplotene stages of meiosis , but modification of the `` sex chromatin '' in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells is abnormal during this period .
Because <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> is found in all branches of mammals , but not in other vertebrates , these results may indicate some commonality in regulation of sex chromatin among the mammals .
Sexual differentiation generates anatomical , physiological , and behavioral dimorphisms that are essential for sexual reproduction .
Many of these dimorphisms affect somatic cells , but the sexual dimorphisms that most directly mediate sexual reproduction are those of the gametes themselves .
Gametes differ between the sexes in size and morphology , sometimes dramatically so , reflecting their very different roles in zygote formation .
Indeed , the morphology of the gametes is what defines sex : females are the sex that produces the larger gametes and males produce the smaller ones .
Mammalian meiosis is regulated sex-specifically starting in embryogenesis and continuing through much of adult life ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) .
For example , the timing and synchrony of meiosis are very different in the two sexes .
In females , germ cells synchronously initiate meiosis in the embryo and arrest during meiotic prophase I .
After puberty , oocytes are selectively recruited for ovulation , when they proceed to metaphase II and then complete meiosis after fertilization occurs [ 2 ] .
In contrast , male meiosis occurs entirely postnatally , without the arrest periods found in females .
In females , each meiosis can produce a single haploid oocyte ( and two extruded polar bodies ) , whereas each male meiosis can produce four haploid spermatocytes .
Other meiotic processes , such as recombination and chromosome pairing ( synapsis ) , occur in both sexes but operate somewhat differently .
For example , there is a higher failure rate for meiosis in females , with human oocyte aneuploidy rates up to 25 % versus about 2 % in human sperm [ 3 ] , and this may indicate that the checkpoints controlling and monitoring the events of meiotic progression in males are more stringent .
Consistent with this idea , genetic analysis of a number of meiotic regulatory genes in the mouse has demonstrated a much stronger requirement in males than in females [ 1,4 ] .
The existence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes , such as the XX/XY system of mammals , creates sex-specific challenges .
One is the need for mechanisms to balance expression of sex-linked genes between the sexes , which in mammals is accomplished by X chromosome inactivation in females [ 5,6 ] .
In male germ cells there is another sex-specific consideration during meiosis .
In prophase I , when the homologous chromosomes synapse and homologous recombination occurs , X and Y chromosome pairing is limited to a region termed the pseudoautosomal region , leaving large portions of each chromosome unpaired .
In eutherian and marsupial mammals , these unpaired chromosome regions are associated with a specialized chromatin domain termed the XY body or sex body .
The function of the XY body is uncertain [ 7 -- 11 ] , but there is evidence that it is essential for male meiotic progression [ 12 ] .
Several proteins are reported to localize to the XY body , including <termsem="PR:000004803"> BRCA1 </term> , <termsem="PR:000004499"> ATR </term> , the histone variant H3 .3 , and modified histones such as ubiquitinated H2A ( Ub-H2A ) and phosphorylated <termsem="PR:000008418"> H2AX </term> ( H2AX ) [ 12 -- 15 ] .
In the XY body , the sex chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced in a process termed meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ) .
The XY body disappears after pachynema ; however , many sex-linked genes remain transcriptionally silent into spermiogenesis [ 16 ] .
This maintenance of silencing is associated with a distinct set of chromatin marks that define a sex chromatin domain termed postmeiotic sex chromatin ( PMSC ) [ 16,17 ] .
Regulators of sexual differentiation have been identified in a number of organisms , but in contrast to many other developmental processes , such as axial patterning or development of many body parts , the molecular mechanisms that regulate sexual differentiation are highly variable between phyla .
A notable exception involves genes related to doublesex ( dsx ) of Drosophila , which share a Doublesex/MAB -3 DNA-binding motif called the DM domain [ 18,19 ] .
DM domain -- encoding genes have been shown to regulate various aspects of sexual differentiation in insects , nematodes , and mammals [ 20 ] .
The mab-3 gene of Caenorhabditis elegans has been shown to function analogously to DSX in several respects and can be functionally replaced by the male isoform of DSX , suggesting that the similarity in the sequence of these genes may stem from conservation of an ancestral DM domain sexual regulator [ 18,21,22 ] .
Vertebrates also have DM domain genes , and analysis to date , although limited , has shown that these genes also control sexual differentiation .
Mammals have seven DM domain genes ( Dmrt genes ) , several of which exhibit sexually dimorphic mRNA expression [ 23,24 ] .
The best studied of these genes , <termsem="PR:000006542"> Dmrt1 </term> , is expressed in the differentiating male genital ridges and adult testis of mammals , birds , fish , and reptiles , and a recently duplicated <termsem="PR:000006542"> Dmrt1 </term> gene functions as the Y-linked testis-determining gene in the Medaka fish [ 25 -- 29 ] .
Human <termsem="PR:000006542"> DMRT1 </term> maps to an autosomal locus , which , when hemizygous , is associated with defective testicular development and consequent XY feminization [ 30 ] .
Similarly , mice homozygous for a null mutation in <termsem="PR:000006542"> Dmrt1 </term> have severe defects in testis differentiation involving both germ cells and Sertoli cells [ 31 ] .
Female mice mutant in <termsem="PR:000006545"> Dmrt4 </term> have polyovular follicles , indicating that this gene also plays a role in gonadal development [ 32 ] .
It appears from these studies that the involvement of DM domain genes in sexual differentiation is ancient and conserved .
However , vertebrate Dmrt gene function is not limited to sexual differentiation : <termsem="PR:000006543"> Dmrt2 </term> is required in both sexes for segmentation in mice and fish [ 33 -- 35 ] .
Here , we have investigated the expression and function of the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> gene in the mouse .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> is expressed only in the gonad , and , unlike the other Dmrt genes , appears to be present exclusively in mammals and not in nonmammalian vertebrates [ 23,36 ] .
We find that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein is expressed only in germ cells and is selectively localized to the XY body of male pachytene germ cells .
To test its function , we generated a conditional null mutation of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> in the mouse .
We find that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> is required in males for progression beyond the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase but is not required in females .
In rare mutant cells that survive to diplonema , we observed sex chromatin abnormalities .
Based on these observations , we suggest that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> plays a critical role in a male-specific chromatin transition between pachynema and diplonema during meiotic prophase .
Expression of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> Proteins in Testis .
Our previous mRNA expression analysis suggested a possible meiotic function for <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> , based on the expression of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mRNA in the fetal gonads of the two sexes [ 23 ] .
In the fetal ovary , <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mRNA was detected primarily from E13 .5 to E15 .5 , the time during which meiosis progresses from pre-meiotic replication to the pachytene stage [ 4 ] , whereas <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> expression in the non-meiotic fetal testis was very low .
Because this earlier work did not examine adult <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> expression , we first performed reverse transcriptase ( RT ) - PCR on mRNA from ten adult organs and detected strong <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mRNA expression in the testis and a trace of expression in heart , but not in any other tissue tested ( Figure 1A ) .
We examined the timing of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mRNA expression during postnatal testis development and detected strong expression beginning at 2 wk , which roughly coincides with the onset of the pachytene stage during the first synchronous wave of spermatogenesis ( Figure 1B ) [ 37 ] .

<termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> is localized to the XY body .
Right-most panel shows merge of other two panels .
Inserts show higher magnification of pachytene spermatocytes with XY bodies .
To investigate <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein expression , we generated an antibody against the C-terminal portion of the protein .
The antibody was raised against a unique region lacking the DM domain in order to avoid cross-reaction with other DM domain proteins .
Immunofluorescent staining with purified <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> antisera showed that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein is expressed predominantly in mid - to late-pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 1C ) , as well as in sperm , and is not detectable in other germ cell types including spermatogonia and round spermatids .
We did not detect <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein in somatic cells such as Sertoli cells , peritubular myoid cells , or Leydig cells .
To more precisely determine the pachytene stages of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> expression , we double-stained with an antibody to <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> , which is expressed in Sertoli cells from stages VII to IX [ 38 ] .
This confirmed that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is expressed in mid - to late-pachytene spermatocytes , starting slightly earlier than stage VII and extending through stage IX ( unpublished data ) .
Within pachytene spermatocytes , <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is concentrated in the XY body , or sex body , a densely staining chromatin domain that harbors the sex chromosomes .
These undergo transcriptional inactivation and heterochromatinization as a result of their incomplete pairing during prophase of mammalian male meiosis [ 17 ] .
To verify <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein expression in the XY body , we double-stained mouse testis sections for <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> and <termsem="PR:000015829"> small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> ) , which is concentrated in the XY body during pachynema [ 39,40 ] .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> and <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> were colocalized , confirming that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein is preferentially localized to the XY body ( Figure 1D ) .
We also confirmed XY body localization of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> by double staining for other markers including Ub-H2A and H2AX ( unpublished data ) .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is not preferentially localized to the XY body at all stages but instead is dynamic .
Based on epithelial staging , it appears that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> localizes to the XY body from mid - to late-pachynema , becomes diffusely distributed in late-pachynema , and disappears in diplonema ( unpublished data ) .
This localization was confirmed by staining of meiotic spreads ( Figure S1 ) .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> also is specifically localized in sperm , with antibody staining mainly in the perinuclear ring of the sperm head manchette .
This staining coincided with the epithelial stages in which <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> localizes to the XY body in spermatocytes ( Figure 1C and 1D ) .
Targeted Deletion of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> .
To establish the functional requirement for <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> , we generated <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  /  mice by targeted disruption in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells using a strategy diagrammed in Figure S2A .
The <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> gene has nine exons with the DM domain encoded by the second and third exons .
Because the DM domain is essential for function of other genes , including mab-3 , mab-23 , and dsx [ 18,19,41 ] , we generated a conditionally targeted `` floxed '' allele in which the DM domain -- containing exons of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> are flanked by recognition sites for the Cre recombinase ( loxP sites ) .
The targeting vector also contained a neomycin resistance cassette ( neo ) flanked by Flpe recognition sites .
The removal of these sequences by Cre-mediated recombination eliminates the DM domain and the translational start site , thus generating a putative null allele .
We identified three homologously targeted ES cell clones by Southern blotting ( Figure S2B ) and injected cells from two clones into C57BL/6 blastocysts .
Chimeric animals from both cell lines transmitted the targeted allele through the germ line .
Targeted animals were bred to <termsem="PR:000003676"> -actin </term> Cre mice to delete the DM domain -- encoding exons , generating the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  allele , or to Flpe transgenic mice to delete the neo cassette , generating the Dmrt7flox allele .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> + /  mice were interbred to generate <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  /  mice .
To confirm the lack of functional <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  /  testes , we stained meiotic spreads from <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants ( Figure S1 ) and sections from mutant testes ( Figure S2C ) and carried out western blot analysis ( unpublished data ) .
In each case , we detected no <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> protein in the mutant testes .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Is Required for Male but Not Female Gametogenesis .
Breeding of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> heterozygotes produced homozygous mutant progeny of both sexes at the expected frequency ( 63/264 ; 23 % ) .
Male and female homozygous mutants were viable , grew to adulthood normally , and exhibited normal sexual behavior .
Female homozygotes were fertile , produced litters of normal size , and had no obvious ovarian abnormalities as judged by histological analysis ( unpublished data ) .
In contrast , <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> homozygous mutant males were completely infertile and had testes about one-third the weight of those of heterozygous or wild-type adult littermates ( Figure 2 ) .
To determine when defective testis development begins in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants , we compared the testes of wild-type and mutant littermates during the first wave of spermatogenesis .
Prior to postnatal day 14 ( P14 ) , mutant testes appeared histologically normal and the testis weights were similar to those of heterozygous and wild-type littermates , indicating that spermatogonia and early meiotic germ cells form normally ( Figure 2B ; unpublished data ) .
Thereafter , the testes of the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant mice ceased to grow and the weight difference was significant .
Microscopic examination of P21 and P42 <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes revealed that germ cells arrest in pachynema , and later stages of germ cells are largely missing ( Figure 2C and 2D ) .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant mice are deficient in postmeiotic spermatids and lack epididymal spermatozoa , although a few cells develop to the round spermatid stage .
These meiotic defects are in agreement with a recent preliminary analysis of another <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutation [ 42 ] .
While some <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant tubules are highly vacuolated and contain primarily Sertoli cells and spermatogonia , others have abundant primary spermatocytes .
In addition , some tubules contain multinucleated cells and cells with darkly stained nuclei that are typical of apoptotic cells ( Figure 2D ) .
Reduced Testis Size and Germ Cell Apoptosis in Mice with Targeted Deletion in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> .
( A ) Testes from a 6-wk-old wild-type ( + / + ) mouse and a homozygous (  /  ) <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant littermate .
( B -- D ) Sections of testes from 14-d-old ( B ) , 21-d-old ( C ) , and 42-d-old mice ( D ) stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
Wild-type is in left column and mutant in right .
No significant difference is observed at 14 d ( B ) , but by 21 d some tubules are lacking abundant spermatocytes ( C , asterisk ) or cells with typical apoptotic morphology are present ( open arrowhead , C and D ) .
Mutant tubules contain multinucleate cells ( closed arrowhead , D ) .
( E and F ) TUNEL labeling of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> - deficient mouse testes .
Testes from wild-type and homozygous mutant littermates were analyzed by TUNEL labeling to detect apoptotic cells .
Testis sections from 21-d-old ( E ) and 6-wk-old mice ( F ) .
Apoptotic cells ( brown ) are much more abundant in seminiferous tubules of homozygous <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant mice relative to wild-type .
Bars in ( B -- F ) represent 100 m .
Since <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes lack most post-pachytene cells , we used TUNEL analysis to test whether the missing cells are eliminated by apoptosis .
At 3 wk , <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes contain significantly more apoptotic cells than those of wild-type controls .
The percentage of tubule sections with five or more apoptotic nuclei was about three times higher in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants compared with wild-type ( 20 % versus 7 % ; Figure 2E ) .
A similar elevation of apoptosis was apparent in mutant testes at 7 wk ( Figure 2F ) .
In mutants , many apoptotic cells were in the middle of the tubules , whereas the apoptotic cells in wild-type occur mainly near the seminiferous tubule periphery .
The numbers of Sertoli cells were not significantly different between wild-type and mutant testes , and we observed no difference in somatic cell apoptosis in mutants ( unpublished data ) .
From these results , we conclude that loss of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> causes a block in meiotic progression , mainly in pachynema , leading to the elimination , by apoptosis , of the arrested cells .
Pachytene Arrest of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Germ Cells .
To better define the spermatogenic stage at which <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  /  male germ cells arrest and die , we used antibodies against several stage-specific germ cell markers .
TRA98 is expressed in PGCs and spermatogonia [ 43 ] .
In the wild-type adult testis , strongly staining TRA98-positive cells form a layer one cell deep ; however , in the mutant TRA98 , strongly positive cells were abnormally organized , and some tubules had a layer several cells deep ( Figure 3A ) .
The BC7 antibody recognizes spermatocytes in the leptotene to early-pachytene stages [ 44 ] .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes had BC7-positive cells in approximately normal numbers , but again abnormally organized , with many positive cells in the center rather than the periphery of the tubules ( Figure 3B ) .
The TRA369 antibody recognizes a <termsem="PR:000005573"> calmegin </term> protein expressed in pachytene spermatocytes through elongated spermatids [ 45 ] .
In contrast to the earlier stages , far fewer TRA369-positive cells were present in mutant testes relative to wild-type ( Figure 3C ) .
We also quantitated the number of cells at each meiotic stage using spermatocyte spreads , assaying chromosome-pairing status by staining for <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> , a component of the synaptonemal complex ( Figure 4 ) .
We found that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants accumulate pachytene cells but have greatly reduced numbers of cells in late-pachynema and beyond .
Together , these results confirm that the meiotic arrest in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants occurs primarily during pachynema and results in efficient elimination of arrested cells .
Prophase I Arrest of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Germ Cells .
Testis sections from 6-wk-old wild-type ( + / + ) and <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant (  /  ) littermates stained with stage-specific antibodies specific to spermatogenic cells .
( A ) TRA98 antibody strongly stains spermatogonia , which are present in wild-type and mutant .
( B ) BC7 antibody stains spermatocytes , which are present in wild-type and mutant .

Profile of Meiotic Arrest in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Testis .
Graph of distribution of meiotic stages of germ cells from heterozygous ( n = 1,970 ) and homozygous mutant ( n = 2,084 ) P26 testes , spread and stained for the synaptonemal complex protein <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> to permit precise staging , which was performed as described [ 64,65 ] .
Normal Meiotic Prophase in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Germ Cells .
Defects in chromosome pairing , synapsis , or recombination can trigger pachytene arrest and apoptosis [ 46 ] .
We therefore examined these events in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes .
To assess homolog synapsis , we used antibodies to <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> , a synaptonemal complex transverse element component , and <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> , a component of the axial element , which remains on the desynapsed axes during diplonema [ 47,48 ] .
Formation of synaptonemal complexes in the mutant was indistinguishable from that in wild-type , as indicated by the proper accumulation of <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> ( unpublished data ) and <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> ( Figure 5A ) .
Likewise , the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant zygotene spermatocytes showed normal accumulation of the early recombination repair marker <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> , suggesting that early meiotic recombination is not significantly affected ( Figure 5B ) .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant spermatocytes exhibited the expected decline in the presence of <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> foci associated with the autosomal synaptonemal complexes ( Figure 5B ; unpublished data ) [ 49 ] .
The few surviving cells that progressed beyond pachynema also underwent apparently normal desynapsis during diplonema ( Figure 5A ) .
From these results , we conclude that chromosomal pairing , synapsis , recombination , and desynapsis during prophase I in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant males are grossly normal .
Normal Synapsis and Recombination in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Germ Cells .
( A ) Testicular cells from <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> heterozygous ( + /  ) or homozygous (  /  ) mutant mice were spread and stained with antibody to <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> ( red ) .
The developmental stages of meiotic prophase based on <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> organization are indicated in each panel .
By pachynema , all autosomes are fully synapsed , and the XY bivalent is synapsed only at the pseudoautosomal region in both wild-type and mutant cells .
( B ) Testicular cells in zygonema and pachynema spread and stained with antibodies to <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> ( green ) and <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> ( red ) .
Size and distribution of <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> foci are similar between wild-type and mutant spermatocytes .
Abnormal Cellular Organization and the Role of Sertoli Cells .
Sertoli cells interact with germ cells during spermatogenesis and the interaction is critical for germ cell maturation [ 50 ] .
Although we did not detect <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> expression in Sertoli cells by antibody staining , we nevertheless considered the possibility that Sertoli cell defects might contribute to the male-specific germ line failure of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants .
To characterize Sertoli cell differentiation , we examined expression of the Sertoli cell markers <termsem="PR:000007859"> GATA4 </term> ( a marker of immature postnatal Sertoli cells ) and <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> ( a mature Sertoli cell marker ) .
The levels of these proteins appeared normal relative to wild-type at P14 and P42 ( Figure 6A -- 6C ) , as did the <termsem="PR:000004191"> androgen receptor </term> ( Figure S3 ; unpublished data ) .
However , the organization of Sertoli cells in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes was abnormal : in some tubules <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> - positive Sertoli cell nuclei were displaced from their usual close apposition with the basement membrane ( Figure 6C ) .
In such tubules , nuclei of pre-meiotic germ cells and spermatocytes were packed close to the basal membrane and few germ cells were found in the adlumenal region .
Abnormal Sertoli Cell Organization in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Testes .
( A ) Testes from P14 wild-type and <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant mice were sectioned and stained with antibody to <termsem="PR:000007859"> GATA4 </term> .
( B ) P14 testis sections stained with antibody to <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> .
At P14 , <termsem="PR:000007859"> GATA4 </term> and <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> levels are similar in wild-type and mutant Sertoli cell .
( C ) Wild-type and mutant testis sections double-stained with antibody to <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> ( red ) and DAPI ( blue ) .
Most Sertoli cell nuclei were adjacent to the basal membrane in wild-type , but mutant Sertoli cells were displaced in some tubules ( arrowhead ) .
White dotted line indicates position of basal membranes .
( D ) Testis sections from 10-wk-old wild-type and Sertoli cell-specific <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant ( SC-Dmrt7KO ) mice stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
Spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis are normal in SC-Dmrt7KO testis .
( E ) Testis sections from 10-wk-old wild-type and SC-Dmrt7KO mice stained with antibodies to <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> ( red ) and <termsem="PR:000003675"> smooth muscle actin </term> ( to outline seminiferous tubules ; green ) .
Sertoli cell nuclei are positioned normally near the basal membrane in SC-Dmrt7KO mice .
The aberrant Sertoli cell organization in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes raised the possibility that the germ cell phenotype might indirectly result from defects in Sertoli cell function .
To test this possibility , we deleted <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> just in the Sertoli cell lineage by crossing mice carrying the floxed <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> allele with <termsem="PR:000006459"> Dhh </term> - Cre transgenic mice [ 51 ] .
The <termsem="PR:000006459"> Desert hedgehog </term> ( <termsem="PR:000006459"> Dhh </term> ) promoter is active starting at about E12 .5 in pre-Sertoli cells but not in germ cells , allowing deletion of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> in Sertoli cells well before any likely requirement for its function [ 52 ] .
Testicular size in Sertoli-targeted ( SC-Dmrt7KO ) animals was slightly reduced from that of wild-type , but histological analysis revealed no obvious difference between wild-type and SC-Dmrt7KO testes ( Figure 6D ) .
Spermatogenesis appeared normal , mature sperm were present , and SC-Dmrt7KO mice were fertile .
In addition , <termsem="PR:000007857"> GATA1 </term> staining showed that Sertoli cell nuclei were located adjacent to the basement membrane as in wild-type ( Figure 6E ) .
These results suggest the germ cell defects of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants are not caused by lack of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> in Sertoli cells .
Rather , the abnormal organization of Sertoli cells appears to result from lack of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> in the germ line .
XY Bodies Form Normally in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Cells .
The data presented so far indicate that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells undergo apparently normal early meiosis and then arrest during pachynema due to a strict requirement for <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> in the germ line .
To better understand the basis of the meiotic arrest , we more closely examined meiotic germ cells in the mutant .
We focused on the XY body , which is thought to be essential for meiotic progression and is the site of preferential <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> localization .
Condensation of the X and Y chromosomes begins in late-zygotene cells , and , by mid-pachynema ( when homologous chromosome pairs are fully aligned ) the sex chromatin forms a microscopically visible spherical structure near the nuclear periphery [ 53 ] .
We first asked whether <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is required for XY body formation by evaluating several characteristic XY body chromatin features .
First , we tested H2AX expression by immunofluorescent staining .
<termsem="PR:000008418"> H2AX </term> is a variant of H2A that is crucial for XY body formation and MSCI [ 12 ] .
H2AX localized normally to the XY body of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> mutant cells in meiotic spreads ( Figure 7A ) , and many H2AX-positive puncta were present in germ cells of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes ( Figure 7B ) .
Next , we examined <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> localization in the mutant testis .
<termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> expression normally increases in the XY body of early - to mid-pachytene spermatocytes at the time of sex chromosome condensation .
Prior to the completion of the first meiotic division , <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> disappears from the XY body as the X and Y chromosomes desynapse [ 40 ] .
Punctate <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> localization was present in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells , again consistent with formation of a correctly marked XY body ( Figure 7C ) .
However , some tubules in mutants had multiple layers of cells with <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> - condensed spots ( Figure 7C ) , rather than the normal single layer of cells .
This accumulation of XY body -- containing cells also was apparent with H2AX staining and is consistent with a developmental arrest of mutant cells in mid - to late-pachytene .
We also examined Ub-H2A localization in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant testes .
In early-pachytene , Ub-H2A is concentrated in the XY body ; by mid-pachytene Ub-H2A is observed throughout the entire nucleus , but it again becomes limited to the XY body in late-pachytene spermatocytes [ 13 ] .
Analysis of nuclear spreads revealed that Ub-H2A localizes normally to the XY body in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants ( Figure S4 ) .
Collectively , these results indicate that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells can establish an XY body with at least some of the normal chromatin marks .
XY Body Forms Normally during Pachynema in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Mice .
( A ) Testicular cells spread and stained with antibodies to H2AX ( red ) and <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> ( green ) .
In pachytene cells , H2AX is concentrated in the XY body both in wild-type and <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant .
( B ) Testes from 6-wk-old mice sectioned and stained with antibody to H2AX ( red ) .
( C ) Testes from 6-wk-old mice sectioned and stained with antibody to <termsem="PR:000015829"> SUMO-1 </term> ( green ) .
Abundant pachytene cells with XY bodies are present in wild-type and mutant testes .
Abnormal Sex Chromatin in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Germ Cells .
Although the XY body can form during pachynema in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants , we considered the possibility that transcriptional silencing might not be properly established .
This would be consistent with the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> phenotype : pachytene cells that escape from MSCI normally are eliminated prior to late-pachytene [ 17 ] .
Recently , MSCI has been shown to continue into meiosis II and spermiogenesis , apparently mediated by a distinct chromatin compartment termed postmeiotic sex chromatin ( PMSC ) that is established starting in diplonema [ 16 ] .
We therefore asked whether the pachytene germ cell death in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants is associated with a failure either to initiate or to maintain sex chromosome inactivation .
First , we examined the mid-pachytene XY body .
To examine XY transcriptional status , we carried out Cot-1 RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) to detect nascent RNA polymerase II transcription , combined with DAPI staining to locate the XY body on spreads of seminiferous tubules ( Figure 8A and 8B ) .
In <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants , the XY body was formed and excluded Cot-1 hybridization ( Figure 8B ) , indicating that transcriptional silencing is established normally in mutant pachytene cells .
We also examined expression of the Y-linked gene Rbmy , which normally is inactivated during pachytene and reactivated after secondary meiosis begins [ 54,55 ] .
Rbmy was inactivated normally in pachytene cells of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutants , based on immunofluorescent staining with an anti-RBMY antibody ( Figure S5 ) .
We also examined <termsem="PR:000005082"> heterochromatin protein 1 beta </term> ( <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> ) , which normally localizes to the X centromere at mid-pachynema and then spreads through the XY body as it internalizes during diplonema [ 56 ] .
We found that <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> localization is normal in <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> mutant cells in mid-pachynema ( Figure 8C and 8D ) .
These results suggest that XY body formation and initiation of MSCI both occur normally in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells .
Chromatin Abnormalities in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> Mutant Diplotene Germ Cells .

( M ) Example of mutant diplotene cell with normal <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> accumulation to the XY body .
All images except those in ( M ) are single Z sections .
We next considered the possibility that sex chromatin is established normally but is not properly modified as cells exit pachynema and begin to form PMSC .
Although most <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells are eliminated by apoptosis prior to diplonema , we were able to examine epigenetic markers of PMSC in rare <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant spermatocytes that escaped pachytene arrest and progressed into diplonema .
First , we examined nascent transcription by Cot-1 hybridization .
Although heterochromatic regions generally showed lower Cot-1 signal than euchromatic regions ( Figure 8E and 8F ) , in some mutant cells the sex chromatin appeared to be incompletely silenced relative to wild-type ( Figure 8F ) .
We also examined three epigenetic signatures of PMSC : histone H3 dimethylated or trimethylated at lysine-9 ( H3-2meK9 , H3-3meK9 ) and spreading of <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> through the XY body [ 16,57,58 ] ( S. H. Namekawa , unpublished data ) .
We observed defects in sex chromatin localization of all three markers in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> diplotene cells .
Although <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> localization to the X chromosome centromere initially appeared normal at mid-pachynema , we observed <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant diplotene cells that failed to show spreading of <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> to the entire XY body ( Figure 8G and 8H ) .
Similarly , we found <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant diplotene cells lacking accumulation of H3-2meK9 and H3-3meK9 marks onto the sex chromatin ( Figure 8I -- 8L ) .
Not all <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant diplotene cells showed abnormal localization of <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> to the sex chromatin ( Figure 8M ) .
In one experiment , 11/27 mutant cells in diplonema lacked <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> on the XY body , as compared with 2/22 wild-type cells .
We hypothesize that the mutant cells with normal <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> may be those that can complete meiosis ( Figures 4 and 5 ) .
Some of the mutant diplotene cells showing abnormal sex chromatin also had abnormal autosomal H2AX staining ( Figure 8L ) .
H2AX localizes to double-strand DNA breaks , so this staining may indicate that some diplotene mutant cells are approaching or entering apoptosis [ 59 ] .
We did not observe sex chromatin defects prior to diplonema , but we can not exclude the possibility that earlier defects exist and the affected cells are rapidly eliminated .
In the preceding experiments , we staged cells based on XY body internalization .
Because this process could be abnormal in the mutant cells , we also staged mutant cells by chromosome morphology using an antibody to <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> ( Figure 9 ) .
This independently identified <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant diplotene cells lacking <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> accumulation in the XY body , such as the example in Figure 9B .
From these results , we conclude that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells establish a normal XY body in mid-pachynema , but then have multiple epigenetic defects in the sex chromatin transition from pachynema to diplonema .
Abnormal Sex Chromatin in Cells Staged by Chromosome Pairing Status .
( A ) Spread of wild-type germ cell stained with DAPI , anti- <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> , and anti- <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> showing chromosome morphology typical of diplonema and internalized XY body with <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> accumulation .
( B ) Spread of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cell showing normal diplotene chromosome morphology and internalized XY body , but no <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> accumulation in the XY body .
XY chromosome pairs are indicated by arrow .
In this study , we find that the DM domain protein <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is required for male germ cells to complete meiotic prophase but is dispensable in the female germ line .
In males , <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> expression is highest in pachytene spermatocytes , and the protein preferentially localizes to the XY body .
Consistent with this expression , we found that most mutant male germ cells arrest in pachynema and undergo apoptosis , although a small proportion can progress to diplonema and sometimes beyond .
Examination of chromatin and nascent transcription in mutant cells that progressed to diplonema revealed sex chromatin abnormalities , as discussed below .
The pachytene stage of prophase involves tremendous chromosomal changes as the homologs align , synapse , and recombine .
During this period , at least one pachytene surveillance system exists to monitor key events of meiotic progression .
Cells in which any of these events is anomalous are efficiently eliminated by apoptosis [ 46 ] .
Another key event of pachynema in male mammals is the packaging of the sex chromosomes into the XY body and the establishment of MSCI .
Examination of male meiosis in XYY mice and mice carrying a sex-chromosome-to-autosome translocation showed that cells in which a sex chromosome escapes MSCI are eliminated prior to late-pachynema [ 17 ] .
This indicates that the establishment of MSCI also is subject to surveillance .
Since the arrest and apoptosis of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant spermatocytes could result from perturbation of any of the critical pachytene events mentioned above , we tested whether they occur abnormally in the mutant cells .
We found that chromosomal synapsis and recombination appear normal in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells .
We therefore focused on the XY body , the most prominent site of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> accumulation .
First , we tested whether the XY body forms and MSCI is established in <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells .
Surprisingly , we found that these cells form an XY body with normal morphology and proper accumulation of all the chromatin marks we examined .
Moreover , Cot-1 hybridization and analysis of RBMY expression demonstrated that MSCI initiates normally in the XY body of mid-pachytene <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells .
We did , however , observe three specific defects in the sex chromatin of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells that avoided arrest in pachynema and were able to enter diplonema .
Normally cells accumulate H3-2meK9 and H3-3meK9 marks and <termsem="PR:000005082"> HP1 </term> protein on the sex chromatin as they progress to diplonema , but we observed mutant diplotene cells lacking these features .
Thus , although a minority of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells can progress from pachynema to diplonema , there are defects in sex chromatin modification during the transition .
A function in male sex chromatin can reconcile the findings that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is required for meiosis , but only in males , and is present only in mammals .
A proportion of mutant diplotene cells have apparently normal sex chromatin ( for example , Figure 8M ) ; these are likely to be the cells that can progress beyond diplonema .
Because most <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant germ cells are eliminated by apoptosis around the time at which we observed sex chromatin defects , a simple model is that the apoptosis is a consequence of the sex chromatin defects .
The reciprocal situation ( sex chromatin defects caused by apoptosis ) is possible , but seems unlikely , because we observed mutant cells with sex chromatin defects but no indications of apoptosis .
Alternatively , apoptosis and abnormal sex chromatin may be two independent consequences of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> loss .
This question can not be answered definitively until we know the detailed molecular mechanism of <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> .
A number of other proteins have been identified that interact with the XY body , including histone variants and modified histones , a testis-specific histone methyl transferase , chromobox proteins , an orphan receptor <termsem="PR:000011413"> germ-cell nuclear factor </term> , and recombination-related proteins [ 60 ] .
A common feature of these proteins is involvement with heterochromatin and/or transcriptional repression .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is unusual among XY body proteins in being related to highly site-specific transcriptional regulators .
An attractive speculation is that <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> may provide sequence specificity in recruiting other proteins , such as chromatin modifiers , to the XY body as part of the transition to PMSC .
Chromatin regulation may be a common mechanism for DM domain proteins , as we find that other DM domain proteins associate with chromatin modifying complexes ( M. W. Murphy , D. Zarkower , and V. J. Bardwell , unpublished data ) .
The finding that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> is essential for mammalian meiosis expands the known functions of this gene family .
Invertebrate DM domain genes so far have only been found to function in somatic cells .
Two other DM domain genes , <termsem="PR:000006542"> Dmrt1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000006545"> Dmrt4 </term> , do affect germ cell development in the mouse .
<termsem="PR:000006542"> Dmrt1 </term> is required in pre-meiotic male germ cells for differentiation of gonocytes into spermatogonia , as well as in Sertoli cells , but it is not expressed in meiotic cells [ 31 ] ( S. Kim and D. Zarkower , unpublished data ) .
The requirement for <termsem="PR:000006542"> DMRT1 </term> in pre-meiotic germ cells and <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> in meiotic germ cells demonstrates that DM domain proteins act at multiple critical points of male germ cell development .
Ovaries of <termsem="PR:000006545"> Dmrt4 </term> mutant females have polyovular follicles ( follicles containing multiple oocytes ) , but it is unknown whether this reflects a defect in the germ line or the soma .
It is notable that at least three mammalian DM domain genes affect gonadal development only in one sex , given the similar roles of related proteins in directing sex-specific somatic development in other phyla .
Strikingly , <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> is present , not only in placental mammals , but also in marsupials and a monotreme ( egg-laying mammal ) , the platypus , which has a clear <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> ortholog [ 36 ] .
However , no close <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> ortholog has been reported in nonmammalian vertebrates , and our database searches did not reveal one .
Thus , <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> likely arose , presumably by duplication and divergence of another Dmrt gene , shortly before or coincident with the mammalian radiation .
Monotremes have five X and five Y chromosomes , which form an extended pairing chain during meiosis and appear unrelated to the sex chromosomes of the other mammals [ 61 ] .
The presence of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> in both lineages may support a common origin for either the sex chromosomes or the sex chromatin of monotremes and other mammals .
A plausible model is that <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> evolved during the establishment of mammalian sex determination to help cope with ancestral differences in gene dosage , chromosome pairing , recombination , or other meiotic issues arising from sex chromosome heteromorphy .
In this regard , we speculate that the recruitment of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> during mammalian evolution may be analogous to the recruitment of chromatin regulatory complexes to achieve somatic dosage compensation during evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in several phyla ( reviewed in [ 62 ] ) .
It will be of interest to determine whether <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> localizes to sex chromosomes during monotreme meiosis .
In summary , we have found that the mammal-specific DM domain protein <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is essential for meiotic prophase progression in males .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> localizes to the sex chromosomes after they are assembled into specialized heterochromatin , and many <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mutant cells have epigenetic defects in the modification of the sex chromatin between pachytene and diplotene .
Although <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> belongs to an ancient and conserved gene family , it is found only in mammals , and to our knowledge <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> is the only example of a mammal-specific protein that is essential for meiosis .
It will be important to determine the precise mechanism by which <termsem="PR:000006549"> DMRT7 </term> affects sex chromatin regulation during male meiosis .
Generation of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> mice .
A mouse <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> cDNA fragment containing sequences from exon 8 was used to screen a mouse BAC library from the 129/SvJ strain ( Stratagene , http://www.stratagene.com ) , and clones containing promoter sequences were isolated and sequenced to obtain <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> genomic sequence .
The targeting vector pDZ169 ( diagrammed in Figure S2 ) was constructed by the following scheme : The vector pDZ157 was used as a backbone vector [ 31 ] .
3  to Pgk-neo and the loxP site , we inserted , as a XmaI/XmaI DNA fragment , the third intron of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> ( from 366 bp to 2,773 bp downstream of exon 3 ) generated by PCR .
5  to Pgk-neo , we inserted an EcoRI/NotI PCR fragment extending from 4,107 bp to 336 bp 5  of the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> translational start .
Finally , we inserted a loxP site and NotI site 336 bp 5  of the <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> translational start .
In the resulting vector , the second and third exons of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> are flanked by loxP sites ( floxed ) .
The <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> - containing portions of pDZ169 were completely sequenced .
pDZ169 was linearized with PmeI and electroporated into CJ7 ES cells ( originally derived from the 129S1 strain ) .
Three homologous recombinants were identified from 296 G418-resistant colonies by Southern hybridization by use of a DNA probe from the sequences upstream of exon 1 to screen genomic DNA digested with EcoRI .
Homologous recombination was confirmed on both ends of the targeted region by Southern hybridization .
Probes for Southern hybridization were made by PCR using primers DM5S10/DM5S11 ( 5  probe ) and DM5PR1/DM5PR2 ( 3  probe ) , listed below .
Two targeted ES cell clones containing the floxed allele Dmrt7neo were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts to generate chimeras .
Chimeric males were bred with C57Bl/6 females to generate heterozygotes carrying Dmrt7neo .
<termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> + / Dmrt7neo females were bred with male <termsem="PR:000003676"> -actin </term> - Cre transgenic mice to delete the floxed sequences and generate heterozygous <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  / + deletion mutants , which were interbred to generate homozygous <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  /  mutants .
Genotyping and RT-PCR .

Targeted Disruption of <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> .
( A ) Diagram of targeting strategy .
Homologous recombination of the targeting vector with the wild-type <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> allele ( <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term> + ) resulted in the targeted allele Dmrtneo .
This allele contains loxP sites flanking the translational start and the second and third exons ( containing the DM domain , gray ) , as well as a neomycine-resistance cassette flanked by Flp recombinase recognition sites ( frt sites ) .
Mice heterozygous for the Dmrt1neo allele were mated with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase , resulting in deletion of the sequence between the two loxP sites , including the neo cassette .
The resulting deletion allele is called <termsem="PR:000006549"> Dmrt7 </term>  .
Mating of Dmrt7neo mice with transgenic mice expressing the Flpe recombinase excised the neo cassette , generating the Dmrt7flox allele .
