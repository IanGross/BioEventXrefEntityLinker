Mouse <termsem="PR:000016672"> Pachytene Checkpoint 2 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> ) Is Required for Completing Meiotic Recombination but Not Synapsis .
In mammalian meiosis , homologous chromosome synapsis is coupled with recombination .
As in most eukaryotes , mammalian meiocytes have checkpoints that monitor the fidelity of these processes .
We report that the mouse ortholog ( <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> ) of <termsem="PR:000016672"> pachytene checkpoint 2 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> ) , an essential component of the synapsis checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans , is required for completion of meiosis in both sexes .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> - deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of oocytes around birth .
The chromosomes of mutant spermatocytes synapse fully , yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates , including <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> , <termsem="PR:000004759"> BLM </term> , and RPA .
These chromosomes also exhibited the chiasmata markers <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000010443"> MLH3 </term> , and okadaic acid treatment of mutant spermatocytes caused progression to metaphase I with bivalent chromosomes .
Double mutant analysis demonstrated that the recombination and synapsis genes <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term> , Mei1 , <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> , and <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> are all epistatic to <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> , suggesting that <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> does not have meiotic checkpoint function in mice .
Our data indicate that <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> is required after strand invasion for completing a subset of recombination events , but possibly not those destined to be crossovers .
To our knowledge , this is the first model to separate recombination defects from asynapsis in mammalian meiosis , and provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the pachytene checkpoint response in mice .
It is critical that the chromosomes carried by sperm and eggs contain faithful representations of the genome of the individual that produced them .
During the process of meiosis , the maternal and paternal copies of each chromosome `` synapse '' with each other ( become tightly associated ) , exchange genetic material via the process of recombination , then separate into daughter cells in the first of two meiotic cell divisions .
The intricate chromosome behavior is subject to errors , so most organisms have evolved meiotic `` checkpoints '' that monitor fidelity of chromosome synapsis and repair of DNA damage .
These checkpoints cause defective cells to self destruct rather than generate defective sperm or eggs .
We studied the effects of deleting mouse <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> , a gene that in distant organisms plays a key role in meiotic checkpoint control .
These experiments revealed that instead of having a checkpoint role , <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> is required for one of the two major classes of recombination in meiosis that is required for repairing broken DNA molecules .
The chromosomes still synapsed normally , but animals were sterile due to massive death of oocytes and spermatocytes .
These results indicate that , in addition to a checkpoint that responds to failed synapsis , one exists to specifically detect unrepaired DNA damage that is due to failed recombination .
The genesis of gametes containing an intact , haploid genome is critical for the prevention of birth defects , and is highly dependent upon the fidelity of chromosome dynamics before the first meiotic division .
Homologous chromosomes must pair , synapse , undergo recombination , and segregate properly to opposite poles .
Recombination , which repairs repair double strand breaks ( DSBs ) that are genetically induced in leptonema , is coupled with synapsis in budding yeast and mammals .
While our knowledge of the assembly and nature of recombination machinery is extensive , little is known about the disassembly of recombination intermediates , recruitment of DNA replication machinery during recombinational repair , and how the choice between different repair pathways is made .
Defects in recombination can preclude homologous chromosome pairing , leave unrepaired chromosome breaks , and cause aneuploidy by abrogating crossing over .
To avoid such deleterious outcomes , surveillance systems ( `` checkpoints '' ) exist to sense meiotic errors and eliminate cells containing unresolved defects .
In many organisms , including S. cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster , C. elegans , and mice [ 1 -- 4 ] , meiocytes with defects in recombination and/or chromosome synapsis trigger meiotic arrest in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase I .
This response to meiotic defects is referred to as the `` pachytene checkpoint '' ( reviewed in [ 5 ] ) .
Genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae have identified elements of the pachytene checkpoint machinery ( reviewed in [ 5 ] ) .
In addition to meiosis-specific proteins , these include factors that play roles in DNA damage signaling in mitotic cells [ 6 -- 10 ] .
Arabidopsis thaliana does not appear to have a pachytene checkpoint akin to that in yeast [ 11 ] , nor do male Drosophila .
The pachytene checkpoint is known to monitor two aspects of meiotic chromosome metabolism in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans : ( 1 ) DSB repair and ( 2 ) chromosome synapsis [ 2,12 ] .
In mice , both spermatocytes and oocytes harboring mutations that disrupt DSB repair ( such as <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> , <termsem="PR:000010669"> Msh5 </term> , and <termsem="PR:000004427"> Atm </term> ) are efficiently eliminated in pachynema , but spermatocytes are much more sensitive to DSB repair -- independent synapsis defects than oocytes [ 13 -- 15 ] .
However , because recombination is required for synapsis in mice ( mutations in recombination genes such as <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> cause extensive asynapsis [ 16 ] ) , it has remained formally uncertain whether there is a distinct pachytene checkpoint that responds to defects in meiotic recombination , and if so , whether it would be identical to that used in somatic cells .
The mechanisms of putative pachytene checkpoint control remain unknown in mammals , since no mutations have been identified that abolish it .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> , encoding a nucleolar-localized AAA-ATPase that was originally identified in an S. cerevisiae genetic screen for mutants that relieve pachytene arrest of asynaptic zip1 mutants [ 8 ] , was recently determined to be an essential component of the pachytene synapsis ( but not DSB repair ) checkpoint in yeast and worms [ 2,12 ] .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> orthologs are present in organisms that undergo synaptic meiosis , but not asynaptic meiosis , prompting the suggestion that a <termsem="PR:000016672"> Pch2 </term> - dependent checkpoint evolved to monitor synaptonemal complex ( SC ) defects from yeast to humans [ 12 ] .
Here , we generated mice deficient for the <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> , the ortholog of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> , and evaluated whether it also plays a role in the pachytene checkpoint .
Surprisingly , while we found no evidence for checkpoint function , we did uncover a potential role for this protein in noncrossover ( NCO ) repair of meiotic DSBs .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> Is a Widely Expressed Mammalian Ortholog of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> with Unusual Phylogenetic Relationships .
The mammalian ortholog of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> , <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000016672"> thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 13 </term> ) , encodes a protein with extensive amino acid homology in regions alignable to the yeast and worm orthologs ( Figure S1 ) [ 12 ] ) .
Interestingly , phylogenetic analysis of <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> / Pch2p shows that the mammalian protein clusters more closely to plants than it does to the evolutionarily more closely related worms and flies ( Figure 1A ; see Discussion ) .
Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR ( RT-PCR ) analysis showed <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mRNA to be expressed in a variety of embryonic and adult tissues , including testis ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with mouse and human EST data summarized in Unigene ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene ) .
It is also highly expressed in human and mouse oocytes [ 17 ] .

Generation of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> Mutant Mice .
To explore the function of <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> in mammals , we generated mice with a gene trap-disrupted allele , Trip13RRB047 ( Figure 1C ; abbreviated as Trip13Gt ) .
Heterozygotes were normal in all respects , but homozygotes were present at  2/3 the expected ratio from intercrosses between heterozygotes ( 91 <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> + / + , 183 Trip13Gt / + , and 61 Trip13Gt/Gt ) .
Since > 90 % of prewean mice that died were mutant homozygotes , this discrepancy is apparently due to a partially penetrant lethality .
Most surviving Trip13Gt/Gt animals were grossly normal .
However , homozygotes that were semi-congenic ( N4 ) on the C57BL/6J strain were often markedly smaller and/or had kinked or shorter tails ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Developmental Phenotypes of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> Mutant Mice .
( A ) Shown are 21-d-old littermates .
Note the shortened tail in the mutant , but overall similar body size .
( B ) Shown are 23-d-old littermates .
The mutant is smaller in this case , but the tail is not as truncated as the mouse in ( A ) .
( C ) Wild-type ( WT ) and homozygous <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutant ( MUT ) testes .
( D ) and ( E ) are cross sections through 17.5-d-old heterozygous ( `` WT '' ) and homozygous mutant <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> testes , respectively .
Whereas the tubules in WT show coordinated spermatogenesis with pachytene spermatocytes present in all tubules ( proximal to the lumen ) , developmental progression in the mutant is not synchronized between tubules .
Some tubules have no pachytene spermatocyes ( asterisks ) , while in others , development is somewhat disorganized ( # ) .
RT-PCR analysis of Trip13Gt expression ( Figure 1D ) revealed a low level of normally spliced transcripts in testes of homozygotes that is presumably a consequence of incomplete usage of the gene trap 's splice acceptor .
Western blot analysis , using a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide encoded by exon 3 , revealed multiple species in wild-type and heterozygous testes , one of which corresponds to the expected size of 48 kDa ( Figure 1E ) .
This and three other species were undetectable in homozygous mutant testes , but a reduced amount of an intense  38 kDa smaller band was present .
It is not clear if this corresponds to <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> .
The greatly decreased <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mRNA and predicted correct-length protein in mutants indicate that the Trip13RRB047 allele is severely hypomorphic .
To determine the germ cell types in which <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> is expressed , and to assess possible expression in the mutant by means other than Western analysis , testis sections were immunolabeled for <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> using a polyclonal chicken antipeptide antibody ( see Materials and Methods ) .
The most intensely labeled cells in control testes were Type B spermatogonia and leptotene spermatocytes ( Figure 1F ) .
Zygotene/pachytene spermatocytes stained less strongly , and there was no detectable staining in late pachytene spermatocytes .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> appeared to be nuclear localized .
There was no such staining of nuclei in mutant seminiferous tubules ( Figure 1F ) .
To further assess the nuclear localization , <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> was used to probe meiotic chromosomes prepared by surface spreading of spermatocyte nuclei .
In wild type , there was diffuse nuclear staining , and no evidence of concentration on SC cores ( marked by the axial element protein <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> ) at any meiotic substage ( Figure 1G ) .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> signal was noticeably absent in mutant meiotic nuclei .
Infertility Due to Meiotic Disruption in <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> - Deficient Meiocytes .
Homozygotes of both sexes had small gonads ( Figure 2C ; see below ) and were invariably sterile .
Ovaries of adult Trip13Gt/Gt females were severely dysmorphic and had few or no follicles ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
The majority of oocyte loss occurred in late embryogenesis or early in postnatal development , since 2 d postpartum ovaries were markedly smaller than those of control littermates , and were lacking oocytes or newly forming follicles ( Figure 3C and 3D ) .
Thus , oocytes failed to progress to the dictyate ( resting ) phase .
Since we observed oocytes with pachytene stage chromosomes in 17.5 d Trip13Gt/Gt embryonic ovaries ( unpublished data ) , this indicates that oocytes were eliminated somewhere between pachynema and dictyate .

Histological sections of mutant testes revealed a lack of postmeiotic cell types that are characteristic of wild-type seminiferous tubules ( Figure 3E ) .
The most developmentally advanced seminiferous tubules contained adluminal spermatocytes with condensed chromatin characteristic of pachynema ( Figure 3F ) .
The absence of coordinated spermatogenic progression beyond this stage is indicative of a pachytene arrest .
This was revealed more clearly by chromosome analysis ( see below ) .
Some sections of adult seminiferous tubules contained postmeiotic spermatids ( Figure 3G ) , although we saw no motile epididymal sperm .
These drastic meiotic defects stand in contrast to yeast and C. elegans , in which deletion of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Pch2 </term> alone has minor effects on spore/gamete development [ 2,8 ] .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> - Deficient Meiocytes Undergo Homologous Chromosome Synapsis Despite the Presence of Unrepaired DSBs in Pachynema .
To better characterize the degree of meiotic progression in Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes , we immunostained chromosome spreads for <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> and <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> , components of the axial/lateral elements and transverse filaments , respectively , of the synaptonemal complex ( SC ) .
Pachytene spermatocyte nuclei from postpubertal mutant testes could assemble normal SC cores and exhibited full synapsis of chromosomes as judged by colabeling of <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> along the full lengths of all autosomes ( Figure 4A ) .
Additionally , the X and Y chromosomes were normally synapsed at their pseudoautosomal region .
More prepubertal ( 17.5 d postpartum ) mutant spermatocytes contained asynaptic or terminally asynapsed chromosomes than age-matched controls ( 62.5 % versus 25 % , respectively ; Figure 4B ) .
We attribute this to a delay in the first wave of postnatal spermatogenesis ( Figure 2D and 2E ) , likely related to systemic developmental retardation ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Nevertheless , since Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes progress to pachynema with no gross SC abnormalities , and oocytes were eliminated soon after birth ( a characteristic of DNA repair mutants [ 13 ] ) , this suggested that unrepaired DSBs are responsible for eventual meiotic arrest and elimination .
Immunohistochemical Analysis of Pachytene Spermatocyte Chromosomes .
Surface-spread chromosomes were immunolabeled with the indicated antibodies and fluorophores .
As indicated in the upper right of each panel , cells were from wild type ( WT , either + / + or Trip13Gt / + ) or Trip13Gt/Gt ( Mut ) .
There were no differences seen between heterozygotes and + / + spermatocytes .

Asynapsed chromosomes or regions of chromosomes are indicated by white and yellow arrows , respectively .
Unlike the normal distribution in wild-type pachytene spermatocytes ( C ) , <termsem="PR:000004759"> BLM </term> foci are present on synapsed pachytene chromosomes in the mutant ( D ) .
<termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> foci , which are abundant earlier in prophase , disappear from autosomes in wild-type pachytene nuclei ( E ) and the bulk of staining is over the XY body ( arrow ) .
( F ) <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> persists on the synapsed mutant chromosomes ( arrows ) .
( G ) <termsem="PR:000008418"> H2AX </term> phosphorylation is restricted to the XY body in WT .

( I , J ) Note that in wild-type pachytene spermatocytes , <termsem="PR:000016548"> TOPBP1 </term> is present only over the XY body ( yellow arrow ) .
In the mutant ( J ) , an arrow denotes one area of intensive staining that may be over the sex chromosomes , but many other chromosome cores are positively stained .

( M , N ) Arrows indicate examples of <termsem="PR:000010443"> MLH3 </term> foci on SCs .
( O ) In WT late pachytene spermatocytes , <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> is present only at background levels .
( P ) As in ( F ) , extensive <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> staining delineates SCs in mutant pachytene nuclei ( indicated by white arcs ) .
<termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> foci colocalize with these tracts ( arrows ) at the typical 1 -- 2 foci per chromosome as in ( M ) .
To elucidate the cause of meiotic arrest , we analyzed meiotic chromosomes with a variety of markers that are diagnostic of recombination and synapsis .
Recombination in Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes appeared to initiate normally as judged by the presence of H2AX in leptonema ( Figure S2A and S2B ) , which reflects the presence of meiotically induced DSBs [ 18 ] .
<termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> and/or <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> , components of early recombination nodules ( ERNs ) , was also present as abundant foci in Trip13Gt/Gt zygotene spermatocytes ( unpublished data ; the anti- <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> antibody cross-reacts with <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> ) , indicating that recombinational repair of DSBs is initiated .
The cohesin complex , which is essential for completion and/or maintenance of synaptic associations , appeared to assemble normally as judged by immunolabeling for the meiosis-specific cohesins <termsem="PR:000015706"> STAG3 </term> ( Figure S2C and S2D ) and <termsem="PR:000013858"> REC8 </term> ( unpublished data ) .
Because yeast <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> localizes to telomeres in a Sir3p-dependent manner , we tested for possible telomere defects by immunolabeling for <termsem="PR:000016236"> TRF2 </term> , a component of a protein complex that plays an essential role in telomere protection [ 19 ] .
It was localized to telomeres of both fully synapsed and telomerically asynaptic mutant chromosomes ( Figure S2E and S2F ) .
Defects in DSB repair became apparent in pachynema upon probing of mutant spermatocyte nuclei with antibodies against molecules involved in various stages of recombination .
In > 99 % of Trip13Gt/Gt chromosome spreads , <termsem="PR:000004759"> BLM helicase </term> ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> / <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> ( Figure 4E and 4F ) , H2AX ( Figure 4G and 4H ) , and <termsem="PR:000016548"> TOPBP1 </term> ( Figure 4I and 4J ) all persisted abnormally on synapsed chromosomes .
For <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> / <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> , mutant pachytene spermatocytes contained 138  6 foci ( compared to 11  3 foci in wild type , most of which were on the XY body ) , down from 218  13 in zygonema ( compared to 220  13 foci in wild type ) .
<termsem="PR:000016548"> TOPBP1 </term> is a DNA damage -- checkpoint protein involved in <termsem="PR:000004427"> ATM </term> protein -- dependent activation of <termsem="PR:000004499"> ATR </term> protein [ 20,21 ] .
It binds sites of DSBs and unsynapsed regions of meiotic chromosomes [ 22,23 ] .
<termsem="PR:000004759"> BLM </term> has been reported to colocalize with markers ( RPA and <termsem="PR:000010668"> MSH4 </term> ) of recombination at sites distinct from those that become resolved as crossovers ( CO ) [ 24 ] .
We therefore assessed the distribution of RPA , the ssDNA binding protein , which is normally present at focal sites of synapsing meiotic chromosomes before disappearing in mid-pachynema [ 25 ] .
It is thought to bind D-loops of recombination intermediates [ 26 ] .
RPA also persisted on pachytene mutant chromosomes ( Figure 4K and 4L ) .
These data indicate that unrepaired DSBs , or unresolved recombination intermediates , remain in pachynema and activate a DNA damage checkpoint system .
It should be noted that chromosomes affected by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ) and meiotic silencing of unpaired chromatin ( MSUC ) are heavily stained by antibodies for several DSB repair-associated molecules , including H2AX .
<termsem="PR:000008418"> H2AX </term> phosphorylation due to MSCI and MSUC is conducted by <termsem="PR:000004499"> ATR </term> , not <termsem="PR:000004427"> ATM </term> [ 27 -- 29 ] .
Since mutant chromosomes are fully synapsed , and MSUC is known to occur only as a result of asynapsis , the decoration of Trip13Gt/Gt chromosomes with DNA repair markers is probably attributable to incomplete DNA repair rather than transcriptional silencing .
Consistent with the presence of rare ( < 1 % ) Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes devoid of persistent DNA repair markers , and testis histology showing some degree of postmeiotic progression ( Figure 3G ) , we observed both diplotene nuclei that lacked autosomal <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> / <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> and H2AX ( Figure S3A -- S3D ) , and also metaphase I spreads with 20 bivalents ( Figure S3E -- S3F ) .
Since Trip13Gt may not be a complete null , these diplotene and metaphase I spermatocytes might arise by virtue of having sufficient wild-type <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> .

The persistence of <termsem="PR:000004759"> BLM </term> on Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocyte chromosomes suggests that at least a subset of the unrepaired DSBs correspond to sites of defective NCO recombinational repair .
To assess whether CO recombination occurs in the mutant , we examined the distribution of the mismatch repair proteins <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000010443"> MLH3 </term> , which are normally detectable as foci in mid-late pachynema and mark the locations of chiasmata [ 30,31 ] .
Remarkably , <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> / 3 foci were formed ; we observed 1 -- 2 foci/chromosome as in wild type and at typical overall levels ( <termsem="PR:000010443"> MLH3 </term> = 23  2 , N = 10 ; [ 30,32 ] ) on mid-late pachytene chromosomes ( Figure 4M and 4N ; <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> not shown ) .
Since < 1 % of Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene nuclei had normal repair ( as judged by absence of persistent DSB repair markers ; see above ) , but most of the pachytene nuclei had <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> / 3 foci , it was unlikely that the <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> / 3 foci formed only on chromosomes with fully repaired DSBs .
To test this directly , we conducted double staining for <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> / <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> .
<termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> foci were present on chromosomes that also contained numerous <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> / <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> foci ( Figure 4O and 4P ) .
To assess whether these <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> / 3 foci in Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent CO events completed to a point where they could maintain interhomolog attachments though the end of prophase I , we treated testicular cells from 17.5 -- 20.5-d-old control ( + / + ) , Trip13Gt/Gt , and <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  mice with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( OA ) , a chemical that induces degradation of the SC , chromosome condensation , and premature progression to metaphase I [ 33 ] .
Fifteen metaphase spreads were identified for each genotype .
Whereas all of the <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  spreads had  35 or more condensed chromosomes , all of the + / + and Trip13Gt/Gt spreads had 20 -- 25 , suggesting that the <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> / 3 foci in Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes represent sites of completed , or near-completed , COs. .
Because the preparations were made from whole testes , it is possible that the univalent-containing metaphases from <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  mice were from spermatogonia , not spermatocytes .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> Deficiency Does Not Alleviate Meiotic Arrest Phenotypes of Mutants Defective in Synapsis .
To determine if <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> deficiency prevents apoptosis triggered by asynapsis as in C. elegans , we analyzed mice that were doubly mutant for <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term> and <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> .
<termsem="PR:000015553"> SPO11 </term> is a transesterase that is essential for the creation of genetically programmed DSB during leptonema of many organisms , including mice [ 18 ] .
In C. elegans , <termsem="PR:000015553"> spo-11 </term> mutant gametes have extensive asynapsis , which triggers <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH-2 </term> dependent apoptosis in pachynema [ 2 ] .
In mice , <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term>  /  spermatocytes are severely defective in homologous chromosome synapsis [ 34,35 ] , and arrest with chromosomes in a state characteristic of the zygotene/pachytene transition ( Figure 3H ) .
Spermatocytes in Trip13Gt/Gt <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term>  /  testes progressed maximally to that point before undergoing death ( Figs 3I ) , well before the spindle checkpoint that eliminates achiasmate spermatocytes [ 36 ] .
There was no evidence of metaphase I spermatocytes or postmeiotic spermatids in these testes , unlike those seen in <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> single mutants ( Figure 3G ) .
In contrast to the complete synapsis in Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene spermatocytes ( Figure 5A ) , in which <termsem="PR:000015553"> SPO11 </term> is available in leptonema to initiate ( via DSB induction , Figure S2A and S2B ) a recombination-driven homolog search , chromosome synapsis in doubly mutant spermatocytes was highly disrupted as in <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term> single mutants ( Figure 5B and 5C ) .
Identical studies were performed with mice deficient for Mei1 , a vertebrate-specific gene also required for DSB formation and chromosome synapsis [ 37 ] , with similar results ( Figure 3J and 3K ; immunocytology not shown ) .
Immunocytological Analysis of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> Compound Mutants .
Surface-spread chromosomes were immunolabeled with the indicated antibodies and fluorophores .
Genotypes are indicated , as are those panels in which dual staining patterns are merged .
Note that ( H ) and ( I ) are at lower magnification to show multiple nuclei .
In yeast , deletion of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> alleviates the pachytene arrest caused by asynaptic mutants zip1 and zip2 [ 8 ] .
Although mouse <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> might be a functional equivalent of Zip1p , because <termsem="PR:000015862"> Sycp1 </term> mutant spermatocytes arrest at approximately the same point as <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutants , there would be no opportunity to observe bypass of <termsem="PR:000015862"> Sycp1 </term>  /  .
Since Zip2p is present at sites of axial associations , even in zip1 mutants , it has been suggested that Zip2p promotes initiation of chromosome synapsis [ 38 ] .
These observations raise the possibility that in yeast , Pch2p responds to synapsis polymerization rather than initiation .
To test this , we performed epistasis analysis with a <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> allele ( Rec8Mei8 , abbreviated as <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term>  ) .
Meiotic chromosomes of <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> mutant spermatocytes undergo apparent homolog pairing and interhomolog synaptic initiation , but are defective in DSB repair and fail to maintain interhomolog synapsis [ 39,40 ] .
Rather , sister chromatids appear to synapse and are bound by <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> along their axes .
<termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> mutants do not progress to diplonema or metaphase I. Double mutant analysis indicated that <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> is epistatic to <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> .
As in the <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term> and Mei1 experiments , histology of testes deficient for both <termsem="PR:000013858"> REC8 </term> and <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> resembled the <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> mutant , with no evidence of progression to metaphase I that occurs in Trip13Gt/Gt mice ( Figure 3L and 3M ) .
Immunocytological analysis of spread chromosomes showed a failure of homologous chromosome synapsis in both the <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term>  /  and <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term>  /  Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes , as previously reported for <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> mutants ( Figure 5D and 5E ) [ 39,40 ] .
Although subsequent reports indicate otherwise [ 10,12 ] , deletion of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> in yeast was originally reported to alleviate meiotic arrest caused by deficiency for the meiosis-specific <termsem="PR:000023696"> RecA </term> homolog <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> [ 8 ] .
To investigate this relationship in mice , we constructed animals doubly mutant for <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> and <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> .
As in <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  mice , in which spermatocytes undergo meiotic arrest from defective DSB repair and failed chromosome synapsis [ 16 ] , spermatogenesis in <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  Trip13Gt/Gt testes was uniformly arrested at the point where spermatocytes contained chromatin characteristic of zygonema/pachynema ( Figure 3N ) .
Immunocytological analysis indicated that both <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  and <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  Trip13Gt/Gt chromosomes had extensive asynapsis compared to Trip13Gt single mutants ( Figure 5F -- 5H ) , and all had persistent <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> / <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> foci and phosphorylated <termsem="PR:000008418"> H2AX </term> ( H2AX ; Figure 5I -- 5L ) , confirming that <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> is epistatic to <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> .
Doubly mutant females had residual ovaries , phenocopying <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term>  /  and Trip13Gt/Gt single mutants ( unpublished data ) .
Meiotic Defects in Trip13Gt/Gt Oocytes Are DSB-Dependent .
Epistasis analysis of females was insightful with respect to the cause of arrest in <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutants .
Both Mei1  /  / Trip13Gt/Gt and <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term>  /  / Trip13Gt/Gt females had ovaries with numerous follicles , identical to Mei1 and <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term> single mutants ( Figure 3O -- 3R ) .
Thus , <termsem="PR:000015553"> Spo11 </term> and Mei1 are epistatic to <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> in oogenesis , just as they are to <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> [ 13,41 ] .
This demonstrates that oocyte loss in Trip13Gt/Gt females is dependent on DSB formation .
In conjunction with the immunohistochemical data , these data provide strong evidence that meiotic arrest in <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutant mice is due to defects in DSB repair .
As expected , ovaries of <termsem="PR:000013858"> Rec8 </term> <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> double mutants were devoid of oocytes as were those from either single mutant ( Figure 3B , 3S , and 3T ) .
Genetic experiments in S. cerevisiae provided evidence that the pachytene checkpoint monitors and responds to recombinational DSB repair and synapsis independently .
Wu and Burgess concluded that the repair checkpoint is <termsem="PR:000013665"> RAD17 </term> - SAE2 dependent , while the synapsis checkpoint is <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> - ZIP1 dependent [ 12 ] .
Of these four genes , SAE2 and ZIP1 do not have clear mammalian orthologs ( although <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> may be a functional ortholog of ZIP1 ) , and mutation of the mouse <termsem="PR:000013665"> RAD17 </term> ortholog , <termsem="PR:000013665"> Rad1 </term> , presumably causes embryonic lethality [ 42 ] .
Thus , mutational analysis of mouse <termsem="PR:000016672"> Pch2 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> ) , which is also critical for the synapsis checkpoint in C. elegans [ 2 ] , was the best remaining option to evaluate potential functional conservation in mammalian meiotic checkpoint control .
Our results demonstrate that in mice , the primary meiotic function of <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> is in recombination itself .
We found no evidence that it is involved in pachytene checkpoint control .
Our data suggest that while recombination events destined to be resolved as COs can proceed normally in <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutants , DSBs that enter the NCO repair pathway are incompletely resolved or processed inefficiently .
This hypothesis is compatible with current knowledge of meiotic recombination pathways .
In S. cerevisiae , CO and NCO pathways are distinct [ 43 ] ; they have different recombination intermediates , and are dependent upon different proteins [ 44,45 ] .
Mice also appear to have independent CO versus NCO recombination pathways [ 46 ] .
As in yeast , both require <termsem="PR:000015553"> SPO11 </term> - induced breaks , but only the CO pathway requires <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> .
Both types of recombinant products are formed by mid-late pachynema .
Another possibility is that the recombination defects are a result of defective intersister recombination .
However , this type of DSB repair is suppressed in meiotic cells .
Ablation of <termsem="PR:000013680"> RAD54 </term> , which mediates intersister recombination in yeast , does not significantly disrupt meiosis in either yeast or mice [ 47,48 ] .
Interestingly , <termsem="PR:000013680"> RAD54 </term> - deficient spermatocytes display abnormal persistence of <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> foci on pachytene chromosomes , similar to those in <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> mice , but there are no deleterious effects on meiotic progression or fertility [ 49 ] .
Data from budding yeast also indicate that Pch2p functions in recombination .
Deletion of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> delays meiotic progression by  2 h in SK1 yeast , and causes a minor decrease in ascus formation [ 50 ] .
DSBs persist > 2 h longer in pch2 yeast than in wild type , and hyperresection of DSBs in dmc1 pch2 double mutants is lower than in dmc1 cells [ 10 ] .
Additionally , it was reported that pch2 yeast had a meiosis I delay dependent on the <termsem="PR:000013665"> RAD17 </term> -- SAE2 checkpoint that monitors recombination intermediates [ 12 ] .
However , the exact role of <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> ( or <termsem="PR:000016672"> Pch2 </term> ) in recombination is unclear .
Because synapsis occurs in <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> - deficient spermatocytes and is dependent on DSB formation ( activity of <termsem="PR:000015553"> SPO11 </term> and MEI1 ) , we suggest that <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> functions after homology recognition and strand exchange , and that recombination events entering the CO repair pathway are either completed or nearly so ( because OA treated resulted in bivalent chromosomes ) .
One possibility for <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term>  s role in recombination is that it is directly involved in a step specific to resolution of NCO recombination intermediates .
Another possibility is that <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> is required for disassembly of NCO recombinational repair complexes [ 51 ] containing those proteins that persist abnormally on Trip13Gt/Gt pachytene chromosomes .
Notably , <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> has two putative ATPase domains , a signature of AAA-ATPase <termsem="PR:000022296"> ClpA </term> / B chaperones that perform protein or protein/DNA complex disassembly [ 52 ] .
These potential recombination roles might not be limited to meiosis , since <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> is widely transcribed and the mutant animals exhibited developmental defects .
Finally , <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> might play an indirect role , such as providing a `` licensing '' signal for the resolution of NCO intermediates and completion of meiosis .
Regarding the cause of cell death in <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutants , our data indicate that this is triggered by defective DSB repair rather than asynapsis .
We base this conclusion on two observations : ( 1 ) oocyte elimination is dependent upon DSB formation and ( 2 ) synapsis is normal in spermatocytes of adult testes .
Indeed , this mutant is unique in that recombination defects occur in the absence of asynapsis ( e.g. , as in <termsem="PR:000006536"> Dmc1 </term> knockouts ) .
Thus , the <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> mutant provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the mammalian pachytene checkpoint response .
Furthermore , our results allow us to conclude that oocytes and spermatocytes share a similar , if not identical , DNA damage pachytene checkpoint that is decoupled from a synapsis checkpoint .
Interestingly , we found that OA treatment of Trip13Gt/Gt spermatocytes could propel them into MI , despite a report that the same did not occur when wild-type pachytene spermatocytes were treated with the DSB-inducing agents gamma radiation or etoposide [ 53 ] .
It is possible that the nascent induction of DSBs in pachynema evokes a checkpoint response that can not be bypassed by OA , whereas the post-strand invasion lesions in <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> - deficient spermatocytes do not .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> was originally discovered to be an interactor with rat <termsem="PR:000016321"> thyroid receptor beta </term> ( <termsem="PR:000016321"> THRB </term> ; [ 54 ] ) , but the relationship between <termsem="PR:000016321"> THRB </term> and <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> in meiosis is unknown .
Interestingly , we observed that <termsem="PR:000016321"> THRB </term> is distributed diffusely throughout wild-type spermatocyte nuclei but is excluded from the XY ( sex ) body ( unpublished observations ) , a compartmentalized nuclear domain beginning in pachynema , in which the sex chromosomes become heterochromatinized and transcriptionally silenced in the process of MSCI [ 55 ] .
However , the XY body appeared intact in most mutant spermatocytes upon probing with several markers of XY heterochromatinization ( unpublished observations ) .
Considering that <termsem="PR:000016321"> THRB </term> knockout mice are viable and fertile [ 56 ] , the functional relationship between <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> and its receptor <termsem="PR:000016321"> THRB </term> in meiosis is unclear .
Given the high similarity of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> orthologs throughout the eukaryotic world , one or more essential functions of this protein must be conserved .
Since <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> does not exhibit checkpoint function in mice , we surmise that the <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> / <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> ancestral protein had a function in recombination that persists to the present .
Notably , A. thaliana does not appear to have a meiotic checkpoint activity that eliminates mutant meiocytes in a manner analogous to organisms such as mice , budding yeast , and female Drosophila [ 11,57 ] , and mammalian <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> is more similar to Arabidopsis <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> than the fly or worm proteins ( Figures 1A and S1 ) .
The unusual relatedness between mammalian and plant <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> may therefore be attributable to both the presence of a common conserved function ( namely recombination , although the role of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> in plants has yet to be determined ) , and the absence of checkpoint function .
Nevertheless , the evolutionary relationships between animals , fungi , and plants ( which are discordant with <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> sequence phylogeny ) do not allow parsimonious models addressing the points in time that checkpoint functions in <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> were gained or lost .
It is possible that its checkpoint function evolved independently in worms and budding yeast .
The picture will become clearer as the function of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> in other organisms is elucidated .
The nature of the synapsis checkpoint in male mice remains unidentified .
One possible candidate is <termsem="PR:000006642"> Dot1 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000006642"> PCH1 </term> in yeast ) , a histone methyltransferase silencing factor that is required for pachytene arrest of zip1 and <termsem="PR:000006536"> dmc1 </term> mutants in yeast [ 58 ] , and for preventing <termsem="PR:000013680"> RAD54 </term> - mediated recombinational DSB repair between sister chromatids .
However , <termsem="PR:000006642"> DOT1 </term> acts upstream of <termsem="PR:000016672"> PCH2 </term> .
Given that <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> does n't have checkpoint function in mice , a potential role for mammalian <termsem="PR:000006642"> DOT1 </term> in the pachytene checkpoint is dubious but awaits investigation .
Recently , it was shown that the <termsem="PR:000003035"> TRP53 </term> homolog <termsem="PR:000016567"> TRP63 </term> is required for DNA damage -- induced death of dictyate-stage primordial oocytes , leading to the suggestion that it is involved in monitoring genome integrity [ 59 ] .
However , this activity occurs subsequent to a pachytene checkpoint .
As alluded to earlier , a complicating problem for studying potential meiotic checkpoint genes in mice is that as in yeast , such genes often have mitotic functions ( such as <termsem="PR:000013665"> RAD24 </term> [ 7 ] ) , and their ablation can cause lethality [ 42 ] .
Unless mammalian pachytene checkpoint components have orthologs with similar functions in organisms such as yeast , their identities are likely to remain elusive .
PCR analysis of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> cDNA .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> was amplified from samples of Clontech 's Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel I ( http://www.clontech.com ) , using the following primers : 5  - GCACCATTGCACTTCACATC-3  ( TRP3-6F ) and 5  - TGACCATCAGACTGTCGAGC-3  ( TRP3-6R ) .
These primers correspond to exons 3 and 6 , respectively , and amplify a 330-bp cDNA product .
The cDNAs in this panel are equalized to allow quantitative analysis by RT-PCR .
Generation of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> - deficient mice .
The mouse embryonic stem cell line RRB047 ( strain 129/Ola ) containing a gene trap insertion in <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> was obtained from BayGenomics ( http://www.baygenomics.ucsf.edu/ ) .
The gene-trapping vector used to create this line , pGT1lxf , was designed to create an in-frame fusion between the 5  exons of the trapped gene and a reporter , geo ( a fusion of -galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II ) .
The gene-trapped locus creates a fusion transcript containing exons 1 -- 3 of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> and geo .
To identify the exact insertion site within intron 3 , PCR was performed using one primer within the gene trap vector , and the other primer at various positions in intron 3 pointing towards the 3  end of the gene .
Product from a productive reaction was sequenced , revealing that the insertion site was 445 bp into intron 3 .
Genotyping of mice .
Three primers were used to distinguish wild-type and mutant alleles of <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> : primer 1 , 5  - CGTCGCTCCATTGCTTTGTGC-3  ; primer 2 , 5  - AGTAGTGGTACACTGTATTTTTGCTTTCATTGA-3  ; and primer 3 , 5  - GTAGATCCCGGCGCTCTTACCAA-3  .
Primers 1 and 2 are located upstream and downstream , respectively , of the gene trap insertion within the intron 3 .
Primer 3 corresponds to pGTlxf sequence .
Primers 1 and 2 amplify a 700-bp band from a wild-type allele ; primers 1 and 3 amplify a 540-bp fragment from a mutant allele .
Separate reactions were used to assay the presence or absence of each amplicon from a DNA sample .
The cycling conditions were : 94 C 2 min ; 35 cycles of 94 C 30 s , 57 C 45 s , and 72 C 50 s ; and 72 C 2 min .
RT-PCR .
Total RNA was isolated from adult testes with the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , http://www.qiagen.com ) , and 4.0 g was oligo dT -- primed and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II ( Stratagene , http://www.stratagene.com ) .
The entire <termsem="PR:000016672"> Trip13 </term> protein-coding sequence was amplified with primers 5  - ATGGACGAGGCGGTG-3  and 5  - TCAAACATAAGCTGAAAGTT-3  .

The primers for amplifying the <termsem="PR:000010303"> Med31 </term> coding sequence as control were : 5  - ATGGCCGCGGCCGTCGCTATGG-3  and 5  - TCATTTCCCTGCTGTGTTATTCTGCTGCTGCTGC-3  .
The cycling conditions were : 94 C 2 min ; 94 C 30 s , 55 C 30 s , and 72 C 35 s for 35 cycles ; and 72 C 2 min .
Development and purification of chicken antibodies .
A peptide corresponding to amino acids 25 -- 40 of <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> , VLQRSGSTAKKEDIK , was conjugated to KLH and used to immunize chickens ( done by Sigma Genosys , http://www.sigmaaldrich.com ) .
Polyclonal IgY was isolated from eggs with the Eggcellent Chicken IgY Purification kit ( Pierce , http://www.piercenet.com ) .
IgY antibodies were then affinity purified using the immunizing synthetic peptide .
Western blotting .
50 g of testis extract in RIPA buffer was separated by 8 % SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a Pure Nitrocellulose membrane ( Bio-Rad , http://www.biorad.com ) .
The membrane was incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human <termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> antibody ( 18-003-42687 ; Genway , http://www.genwaybio.com ) .
According to the manufacturer , the immunogen was a synthetic peptide embedded in sequence we deduced to correspond to exon 3 .
Binding was detected by chemiluminescence ECL kit ( Pierce ) using a rabbit anti-chicken IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Pierce ) .

Immunocytochemistry .
Immunolabeling of surface-spread spermatocytes and oocytes was performed as described [ 39,62 ] .
To reach conclusions on the pattern of staining for various proteins , 30 ( unless otherwise indicated ) well-spread nuclei of particular meiotic stages were first identified under the fluorescent microscope on the basis of <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> or <termsem="PR:000015706"> STAG3 </term> staining , then imaged at both appropriate wavelengths to determine the pattern of second proteins with focal patterns such as <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> or RPA .
Unless otherwise indicated , the panels shown in the figures were the exclusive or predominant patterns seen .
The exception for this approach was in the case of staining for <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> or <termsem="PR:000010443"> MLH3 </term> plus <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> ( in which case <termsem="PR:000015865"> SYCP3 </term> or <termsem="PR:000015706"> STAG3 </term> was not available to find chromosome cores ) .
Nuclei in this situation were identified first by <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> / 3 foci clustering , then imaged for both fluorescent wavelengths .
Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows : mouse anti- <termsem="PR:000015865"> SCP3 </term> ( 1:500 ; Abcam , http://www.abcam.com ) ; rabbit anti- <termsem="PR:000015862"> SYCP1 </term> ( 1:1,000 ; a gift from C. Heyting ) [ 63 ] ; rabbit anti- <termsem="PR:000013858"> REC8 </term> ( 1:100 ; a gift from C. Heyting ) ; rabbit anti- <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> ( 1:250 , this polyclonal antibody recognizes both <termsem="PR:000013672"> RAD51 </term> and <termsem="PR:000006536"> DMC1 </term> ; Oncogene Research Products , http://www.merckbiosciences.co.uk ) ; rabbit anti-H2AX ( 1:500 ; Upstate Biotechnology , http://www.upstate.com/ ) ; rabbit anti- <termsem="PR:000015706"> STAG3 </term> ( 1:1,000 ; a gift from R. Jessberger ) ; rabbit anti- <termsem="PR:000010443"> MLH3 </term> ( 1:400 ; a gift from P. Cohen ) ; mouse-anti-human <termsem="PR:000010442"> MLH1 </term> ( 1:50 ; BD Biosciences , http://www.bdbiosciences.com ) ; rabbit-anti - <termsem="PR:000016548"> TopBP1 </term> ( 1:100 ; a gift from J. Chen ) [ 22 ] ; mouse-anti-ubiquityl-histone H2A ( 1:200 ; Upstate Biotechnology ) ; rabbit-anti - <termsem="PR:000016236"> TRF2 </term> ( 1:500 ; a gift from T. de Lange ) ; and rabbit-anti - <termsem="PR:000004759"> BLM </term> ( 1:50 ; a gift from R. Freire ) .
All secondary antibodies conjugated with either Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 ( Molecular Probes , http://probes.invitrogen.com/ ) were used at a dilution of 1:1,000 .
All images were taken with a 100  objective lens under immersion oil .
Metaphase I spermatocyte spreads and OA treatment .
Metaphase fixed spermatocytes from 8-mo-old Trip13RRB047 homozygotes , using 23-d-old wild-type mice as control , were prepared and stained with Giemsa as described [ 64 ] .
For OA treatment , cells were exposed to 5 M OA ( Calbiochem , http://www.emdbiosciences.com ) for 6 h at 32 C in a humidified environment of 5 % CO2 before spreading [ 65 ] .
These preparations were stained with DAPI to visualize metaphase nuclei and chromosomes .
Phylogenetic analyses .
<termsem="PR:000016672"> TRIP13 </term> orthologs were identified by BLASTP searches of Genbank and other sources providing gene models such as Ensembl .
The selected orthologs can be found in Table S1 .
Amino acid alignments were done with Clustal W , using the default settings with and without removing the regions outside of the AAA-ATPase central domain .
The trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining method with Poisson correction .
The reliability of internal branches was assessed by using 500 bootstrap replicates , and sites with gaps were ignored in this analysis .
Neighbor-joining searches were conducted by using the computer program MEGA3 [ 66 ] .
