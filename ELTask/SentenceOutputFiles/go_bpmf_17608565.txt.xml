Rb-Mediated Neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> through <termsem="GO:0007049"> Cell-Cycle </term> -- Independent <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulation </term> of E2f3a .
It has long been known that loss of the retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) perturbs neural <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , but the underlying mechanism has never been solved .
Rb absence impairs <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit and triggers <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> of some neurons , so <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects may well be indirect .
Indeed , we show that abnormalities in both <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and light-evoked electrophysiological responses in Rb-deficient retinal cells are rescued when ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> are blocked specifically by deleting E2f <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> ( E2f ) 1 .
However , comprehensive cell-type analysis of the rescued double-null retina exposed <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell-cycle </term> -- independent <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects specifically in starburst amacrine cells ( SACs ) , cholinergic interneurons critical in direction selectivity and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmentally </term> important <termsem="GO:0048511"> rhythmic </term> bursts .
Typically , Rb is thought to block <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> by <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressing </term> E2fs , but to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiating </term> tissue-specific factors .
Remarkably , however , Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by inhibiting E2f3 activity .
Two E2f3 isoforms exist , and we find both in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> retina , although intriguingly they show distinct <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular distribution </term> .
E2f3b is thought to mediate Rb function in quiescent cells .
However , in what is to our knowledge the first work to dissect E2f isoform function in vivo we show that Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f3a .
These data reveal a mechanism through which Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulates </term> neural <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> directly , and , unexpectedly , it involves inhibition of E2f3a , not <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiation </term> of tissue-specific factors .
The retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , an important tumor suppressor , blocks <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> by inhibiting the E2f <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> family .
In contrast , Rb is thought to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiating </term> tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , although <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in Rb null cells could be an indirect consequence of E2f - <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> .
Here , we resolve different mechanisms by which Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> , <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the retina .
Removing E2f1 rescues aberrant <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> Rb-deficient retinal neurons , as well as <termsem="GO:0008219"> death in cells </term> prone to <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , and restores both normal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and function of major cell types , such as photoreceptors .
However , Rb-deficient starburst amacrine neurons <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> abnormally even when E2f1 is removed , providing an unequivocal example of a direct role for Rb in neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Rather than <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiating </term> a cell-specific factor , Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> starburst <termsem="GO:0030154"> cell differentiation </term> by inhibiting another E2f , E2f3a .
This <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell-cycle </term> -- independent activity broadens the importance of the Rb -- E2f pathway , and suggests we should reassess its role in the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of other cell types .
The simplicity of the retina makes it an ideal tissue to study <termsem="GO:0022008"> neurogenesis </term> .
Its <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> proceeds through three overlapping steps starting with retinal progenitor cell ( RPC ) proliferation , followed by birth of post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> retinal transition cells ( RTCs , also referred to as precursors ) , and ending with terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of seven major cell types ( Figure 1A ) [ 1 ] .
RPCs are multipotent and exit the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> to <termsem="GO:0032502"> generate </term> different RTCs at specific time periods in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 1 ] .
This process of RTC `` birth '' requires coupling of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit .
Once born , post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> RTCs <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> and <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> different retinal layers .
Rods and cones make up the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) ; horizontal , bipolar , and amacrine cells , as well as Mller glia cell bodies , <termsem="GO:0051179"> reside </term> in the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) ; and ganglion and displaced amacrine cells <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> the ganglion cell layer ( GCL ) ( Figure 1A ) .
The outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) and inner plexiform layer ( IPL ) house synaptic connections separating the ONL/INL and INL/GCL , respectively .

At E11 the retina is a NBL of <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> RPCs ( white circle , green nuclei ) .
RPC cell bodies oscillate along processes as they progress through the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> .
By P0 the NBL contains both RPCs and post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> RTCs ( coloured circles , red nuclei ) and is separated from the GCL by the IPL .
By P8 there are no RPCs , fewer RTCs , an OPL , and more <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> rods ( r ) and cones ( c ) in the ONL ; horizontal ( h ) , bipolar ( b ) , Mller ( m ) , and amacrine ( a ) cells in the INL ; and ganglion ( g ) and displaced amacrine cells in the GCL .

( B ) Rb is thought to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> by <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressing </term> E2fs , but to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiating </term> tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> .
However , Rb loss could also perturb <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through the indirect effects of abnormal <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> or <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> , and/or through direct <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> genes by E2fs .

E2fs <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to DNA as heterodimers with proteins of the related Tfdp family .
E2f1 , E2f2 , and E2f3a are `` activating E2fs '' that are required for fibroblast <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> .
They are strong <termsem="GO:0016563"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> activators </term> </term> that can <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> G0 fibroblasts into cycle , and are inhibited when <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to Rb [ 4,5 ] .
Ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> in Rb KO embryos can be rescued to various extents in different tissues by knocking out E2f1 , E2f2 , or E2f3 [ 6 -- 9 ] , but which member ( s ) <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> in Rb KO RTCs is unknown .
Other members of the family , such as E2f4 and E2f5 , are known as `` <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressive </term> E2fs '' because they are weak activators and appear to be primarily involved in <termsem="GO:0016458"> gene silencing </term> in quiescent or <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> cells .
Activating E2fs may also <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 1B ) .
Originally , E2f1 was considered the primary <termsem="GO:0043065"> pro- <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> </term> member of the family [ 10 ] .
However , this view was reevaluated when it was shown that either E2f1 or E2f3 deletion rescues <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> central nervous system ( CNS ) of Rb KO embryos [ 6,11 ] .
Subsequently , CNS <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> was shown to be an indirect result of placental defects and probable hypoxia [ 12 -- 14 ] .
Indeed , E2f3-induced <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in fibroblasts has recently been shown to require E2f1 [ 15 ] .
Thus , it is controversial whether E2f3 is required for <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> of any Rb KO cell type .
Determining which activating E2fs <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in distinct Rb KO tissues requires conditional rather than germ line models of Rb deletion to avoid secondary indirect effects ( such as hypoxia ) .
E2f family diversity is expanded by E2f3 isoforms .
Alternative promoters <termsem="GO:0009058"> generate </term> two forms ( a and b ) that are identical except for distinct first exons [ 16 ] .
E2f3a is a strong activator , and , like other activating E2fs , its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is induced when quiescent cells are <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulated </term> to <termsem="GO:0051301"> divide </term> [ 16 ] .
E2f3b , like <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressive </term> E2fs , is present in both quiescent and <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> cells , and in quiescent fibroblasts it associates primarily with Rb , suggesting that it mediates <termsem="GO:0048519"> repression </term> [ 16 -- 18 ] .
Indeed , <termsem="GO:0016458"> silencing </term> the Cdkn2d ( p19Arf ) locus in unstressed cells relies on E2f3b [ 19 ] .
Other E2fs may also exist in isoforms since at least two mRNA species have been detected for E2f1 and E2f2 [ 16 ] .
The roles of E2f isoforms in vivo are unknown .
E2fs are also <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> .
Although this feature has been best characterized for <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressive </term> E2fs [ 20 -- 22 ] , it also affects activating E2fs [ 23 -- 25 ] .
The <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of E2f isoforms has never been assessed .
It has been known for many years that Rb loss perturbs neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 26 -- 29 ] .
However , prior work could not exclude the possibility that <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects are simply an indirect consequence of abnormal <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> .
If Rb does <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> directly it is unclear whether it does so in all or a subset of neurons .
Moreover , the mechanism has never been solved .
In other cell types where Rb may <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> directly , such as muscle and bone , it seems to do so through E2f-independent means by <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiating </term> tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> ( Figure 1B ) [ 30 -- 33 ] .
In the retina , others have noted abnormally shaped Rb KO rods and have suggested Rb may directly <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> their <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> by activating retina-specific factors [ 29 ] .
However , <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in any Rb KO neuron could be an indirect effect of ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and/or <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> ( Figure 1B ) .
Thus , it is critical to study differentiation of Rb KO cells in the absence of ectopic <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> .
Here , we establish that Rb <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppresses </term> RTC <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> by inhibiting E2f1 , not E2f2 or E2f3 .
When these defects were rescued , most retinal neurons , including rods , survived , <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> , and functioned normally .
Thus , unexpectedly , retina-specific <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> factors function independently of Rb .
However , comprehensive assessment of the Rb/E2f1 double-null rescued retina revealed a <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defect in cholinergic starburst amacrine cells ( SACs ) .
Recent breakthroughs have revealed that these interneurons are critical for direction selectivity and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmentally </term> important <termsem="GO:0048511"> rhythmic </term> bursts [ 34 -- 36 ] .
However , their <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is poorly understood .
Contrary to the prevailing view that Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f-independent tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , we show that Rb facilitates SAC <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> through E2f3 .
Defects in Rb null SACs correlated with specific E2f3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in these cells , and E2f3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was absent in neurons that <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> without Rb .
E2f3 is also present in a specific subset of other CNS neurons , implying that this may be a general mechanism by which Rb facilitates <termsem="GO:0022008"> neurogenesis </term> .
To define the mechanism in even more detail , we determined which E2f3 isoform Rb targets to <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
E2f3b mediates Rb function in quiescent fibroblasts [ 19 ] , yet no prior studies to our knowledge have dissected E2f3a or E2f3b functions in vivo .
Using an isoform-specific null mouse we show that Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> drives </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f3a .
Thus , independent of E2f1-mediated effects on <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> , Rb does <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , but only in specific neurons and , unexpectedly , through E2f3a , not tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> factors .
Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulates </term> <termsem="GO:0051301"> Division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> Death </term> through E2f1 .
We used the -Cre transgene to delete floxed Rb exon 19 at embryonic day ( E ) 10 in peripheral retina [ 2 ] .
RbloxP/loxP ; -Cre mice were <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> with strains lacking E2f1 or E2f2 in the germ line , or a strain carrying a floxed E2f3 allele [ 5 ] .
RbloxP/loxP ; E2f1 + /  and RbloxP/loxP ; E2f1 + /  ; -Cre mice were <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> to <termsem="GO:0000003"> produce </term> RbloxP/loxP ; E2f1  /  ; -Cre mice at a frequency of 1/8 and littermate controls at the same or higher ( 1/4 ) frequency .
For simplicity we will refer to the RbloxP/loxP ; E2f1  /  ; -Cre peripheral retina as the Rb/E2f1 double knockout ( DKO ) retina .
Similar strategies were employed in the case of E2f2 or E2f3 .
Cre-mediated excision of Rb and E2f3 alleles in the retina was confirmed by PCR as described previously [ 2,5 ] .
To measure ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> , mice were pulse-labelled with bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) 2 h before sacrifice and the peripheral retina analyzed for BrdU incorporation by immunofluorescence .
As reported before [ 2,3 ] , Rb KO retinas exhibited both spatial and temporal ectopic DNA <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> ( Figures 1C and S1A ) .
This is easily detected at E14 , E16 , and postnatal day ( P ) 0 in the inner retina where abnormal BrdU + ganglion and amacrine RTCs are located , or on the outermost region of the P0 retina , where BrdU + photoreceptor RTCs <termsem="GO:0051179"> reside </term> ( Figures S1A and S2 , arrows ) [ 2 ] .
Ectopic RTC <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> in Rb KO retinas is even more obvious at P8 or P18 , when <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> is completed in wild-type ( WT ) retina ( Figures 1C and S1A ) .
Strikingly , the ectopically <termsem="GO:0051179"> positioned </term> <termsem="GO:0051320"> S-phase </term> cells at E14 , E16 , and P0 and all the abnormal <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> at P8 and P18 were completely <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1C , 1E , 1F , S1A , and S2 ) .
In contrast , deletion of E2f2 or E2f3 had no effect at any stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Analysis of <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> cells with anti -- phosphohistone 3 ( PH3 ) -- specific antibodies confirmed that loss of E2f1 , but not E2f2 or E2f3 , <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> ( Figure S3 ) .
Deleting one E2f1 allele partially <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051320"> S-phase </term> and <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> in Rb KO RTCs ( Figures 1C , 1E , 1F , S1A , S2 , and S3 ) , suggesting that E2f1 <termsem="GO:0048518"> drives </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> in Rb KO RTCs in a dose-dependent fashion .
These data contrast with previous findings in the lens and CNS of Rb KO embryos , where deletion of any activating E2f <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppresses </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> to some extent [ 6 -- 9 ] .
Loss of Rb in the retina results in considerable RTC <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> , <termsem="GO:0012501"> eliminating </term> most bipolar and ganglion cells as well as many rods ( Figure 2A -- 2D ) [ 2,3 ] .
The loss of Rb KO rods is evident from the thinner ONL , and the death of these cells as well as bipolar and ganglion neurons can be detected directly by double labelling for <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> and cell-type-specific markers [ 2 ] ( M. P. and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
Loss of peripheral Rb KO ganglion cells is also evident from thinning of the optic nerve ( D. C. and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
Deleting E2f1 , but not E2f2 or E2f3 , blocked this ectopic <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> in a dose-dependent fashion ( Figures 1D , 1G , and S1B ) .
E2f1 Deletion Rescues Ganglion , Rod , and Bipolar Cells in the Rb KO Retina .
( A ) Horizontal retinal sections from mice of the indicated ages and genotypes were stained for nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) and markers that detect ganglion cells ( Pou4f2 , red ) , rods and cones ( Sag [ rod arrestin ] , green ) , and rod bipolar cells ( Prkca , green , and Cabp5 , red ) .
Scale bars are 50 m .

( C ) Quantification of Prkca + and Cabp5 + bipolar cells .
( D ) Thickness of the ONL , which represents the number of rods .
Error bars represent SD of measurements from three animals , and asterisks indicate a significant difference between retinas of WT and the indicated genotypes , unless indicated otherwise by connecting lines ( * , p < 0.05 ; ** ; p < 0.01 ; ANOVA and Tukey HSD test ) .
( E and F ) ERGs were recorded from the indicated genotypes under dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ( scotopic ) conditions , and ( E ) intensity series and ( F ) b-wave amplitudes as a function of the logarithm of the flash intensity were determined .
( F ) Further illustrates that the relative influence of the mutations on the photoreceptors ( indicated by the saturated a-wave amplitude , right graph ) was not substantially different from their effect on the b-wave <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> ( dominated by the bipolars , left graph ) at the same intensity of 10 cd  s/m2 .
To investigate the molecular mechanism that underlies the unique role of E2f1 , we assessed the expression of known E2f targets as well as other genes that <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
Numerous positive and negative <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> regulators were <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulated </term> in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 1H ) .
Among the E2f family , E2f1 , E2f2 , E2f3a , and E2f7 were induced following Rb loss , but E2f3b , E2f4 , and E2f5 were unaffected .
Consistent with the BrdU and terminal dUTP nick-end labelling ( TUNEL ) analyses , E2f1 deletion specifically reversed all these molecular defects , but E2f3 deletion had no effect ( Figure 1H ) .
Normal <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> in the Rb/E2f1 DKO Retina .
Because E2f1 deletion blocks abnormal <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in the Rb KO retina , the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina provided a unique opportunity to evaluate whether Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> independent of <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> effects .
The Rb/E2f1 DKO retina had many Sag + ( S-antigen/rod arrestin ) photoreceptors , Pou4f2 + ( Brn3b ) ganglion cells , and numerous Prkca + / Cabp5 + bipolar neurons ( Figure 2A -- 2D ) .
In contrast , there was no such rescue of cell types in Rb/E2f2 or Rb/E2f3 DKO retinas ( Figure S4 ) .
Analysis with general neuronal markers Mtap2 ( MAP2 ) and Snap25 , as well as other markers <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in bipolar cells ( Chx10 , Rcvrn , Vsx1 , Tacr3 , and Atp2b1 ) and rod photoreceptors ( Rho and Rcvrn ) confirmed rescue of the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Table S1 ) .
Moreover , neurons exhibited the same complex morphology as in WT retina .
Bipolar cell bodies were located in the INL and had ascending and descending processes ending in the OPL and IPL , respectively ( Figure 2A ) .
In addition , the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina had a healthy appearing ONL consisting of morphologically normal rods with descending processes ending in the OPL and ascending processes that terminated in inner and outer segments ( Figure 2A ) .
It was suggested that Rb might <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , possibly through rod-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> ( Figure 1B ) [ 29 ] .
However , if Rb does <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , it does so by inhibiting E2f1 , not by <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiating </term> rod <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> factors , such as Otx2 , Crx , or Nrl .
It is impossible to tell whether E2f1 perturbs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> directly , by affecting the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> that <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulate </term> <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> , and/or indirectly through its effects on <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and survival ( Figure 1B ) .
As with ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> ( Figure 1C and 1D ) , the rescue of Rb KO retinal bipolar , ganglion , and rod cells was dependent on E2f1 dose ( Figure 2A -- 2D ) .
Separate from its role in <termsem="GO:0048518"> driving </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> of Rb KO RTCs , E2f1 also <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> normal RPC <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> since in its absence RPC <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> drops ~ 2-fold ( D. C. and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
This modest reduction of RPC numbers in the absence of E2f1 accounts for the slight reduction in the number of ganglion cells at P0 , in the number of bipolar cells at P18 or P30 , and in the thickness of the ONL at P18 or P30 in the E2f1 KO and Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure 2B -- 2D ) .
The morphology of E2f1 KO neurons was WT ( Figure 2A ) .
Despite a slight drop in absolute cell numbers , the proportion of Rb/E2f1 DKO and E2f1 KO bipolar cells was the same as WT ( data not shown ) .
Slightly reduced cell numbers were not due to residual RTC <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> since we have not observed ectopic <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> at any embryonic or postnatal stage in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Figures 1D , 1G , and S2 ) .
Moreover , deleting Ccnd1 , which acts upstream of Rb proteins , also reduces RPC number , but does not <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> any defect in the Rb KO retina ( D. C. and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
Thus , slightly reduced RPC <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and dramatic rescue of severe defects in Rb KO RTCs are distinct effects stemming from the deletion of E2f1 .
Normal Function of the Rb/E2f1 DKO Retina .
The discovery that E2f1 loss rescues even the morphology of Rb KO neurons is surprising because Rb is thought to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> primarily through E2f-independent pathways [ 30 -- 33 ] .
However , normal morphology may not equate to completely normal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Thus , we compared the electroretinograms ( ERGs ) of adult WT ( -Cre ) , E2f1  /  , -Cre ; RbloxP/loxP , and -Cre ; RbloxP/loxP ; E2f1  /  mice .
ERGs functionally assess <termsem="GO:0007602"> <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual </term> signalling </term> in the mammalian retina from photoreceptors to amacrine cells ( but usually not gangion cells ) , and are dominated by rod and cone bipolar cells .
Typically , an ERG signal begins with a negative deflection initiated by the photoreceptors ( the a-wave ) , which is terminated by a large positive deflection due to the activation of ON bipolar cells ( the b-wave ) .
<termsem="GO:0009645"> Responses to dim light </term> in dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ( scotopic ) conditions specifically assess the rod system , and were defective in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 2E ) .
The substantial reduction of both a - and b-waves is consistent with rod and bipolar <termsem="GO:0006915"> cell apoptosis </term> [ 2 ] .
The sensitivity of the residual <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> appeared unchanged , suggesting it arose from the Cre-negative portions of the retina .
<termsem="GO:0050896"> Responses </term> were about the same in the WT and E2f1 KO retina , and , most importantly , also the Rb/E2f1 DKO <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> median lay at the lower end of the normal range for most intensities ( Figure 2F ) .
Thus , E2f1 deletion almost completely rescued the rod system in the Rb KO retina .
Light - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ( photopic ) recordings to specifically assess the cone system yielded comparable results .
Cones represent only 3 % of photoreceptors and , unlike rods , <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> without Rb , but they require rods for survival , and in the Rb KO retina , they have abnormal morphology and their synaptic targets , bipolar cells , are much depleted [ 2 ] .
The photopic <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> , a product of cone and mainly bipolar activity , was much reduced by Rb loss , but was rescued considerably in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure S5 ) .
Again , the median amplitude lay at the lower end of the E2f1 KO range .
The photopic <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> in E2f1 KO mice was slightly reduced relative to WT ( Figure S5B ) , possibly because E2f1 is required for maximal <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of embryonic RPCs , and the E2f1 KO retina has , as noted earlier , slightly fewer cells than the WT retina , although cell type proportions are unaffected ( D. C. and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
Thus , marginally subnormal photopic <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina can be attributed to both a reduction of cone numbers in E2f1 KO mice alone , and a `` genuine '' slight reduction in cone function attributable to Rb loss relative to WT .
This slight effect may relate to a true <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defect in a subset of amacrine cells discussed below .
This discussion should not obscure the major outcome that E2f1 deletion recovers most of the ERG <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> .
Thus , E2f1 deletion not only rescues morphology but also both rod and cone system function in the Rb KO retina .
Abnormal SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> Independent of <termsem="GO:0007049"> Cell Cycle </term> and Survival Defects .
ERGs primarily assess photoreceptor and bipolar cell function , but may miss <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in other cells .
To test for subtle differences we stained the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina with 43 markers ( Table S1 ) .
Thirty-two proteins displayed identical patterns in WT , E2f1 KO , and Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Table S1 ) .
The other 11 markers revealed a <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell-cycle </term> -- and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> - independent <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defect in SACs .
We first studied Calb2 ( calretinin ) , which marks a subset of amacrine and ganglion cell bodies as well as three tracks corresponding to their processes in the IPL ( Figure 3A ) .
Normal Calb2 staining was seen in the E2f1 KO IPL ( data not shown ) .
However , only one Calb2 + track was evident in the Rb KO IPL , and this defect was not rescued in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina ( Figure 3A ) .
We quantified Calb2 + cell bodies in the Rb KO INL ( corresponding to amacrine cell staining only ) and observed a reduction from P8 onwards ( Figures 3C and S6 ) .
<termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> Defects in Rb KO SACs .
( A ) P18 horizontal sections of WT , Rb KO , and Rb/E2f1 DKO retina were stained for nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) , Calb2 ( green ) , and Slc18a3 ( red ) .
( B ) Confocal images of P30 horizontal sections of WT and Rb KO retina were stained for nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) , <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> and Slc18a3 ( both red ) , and Camk2a ( green ) .
In the Rb KO section , the red stain is <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> only , as Slc18a3 is missing ( see [ A ] ) .
( C ) Quantification of dense Calb2 + cell bodies in the INL , total Slc18a3 + cell bodies , and Camk2a + cell bodies in the INL .
Error bars represent SD of measurements from three animals , and asterisks indicate significant differences between retinas of WT and the indicated genotypes ( * , p < 0.05 ; ** ; p < 0.01 ; ANOVA and Tukey HSD test ) .
Scale bars are 50 m in ( A ) and 20 m in ( B ) .
Of the three Calb2 + tracks in the IPL , the two outer tracks are from SACs , named after their extensive dendritic-tree-like morphology [ 37 ] .
SACs are cholinergic , represent ~ 5.2 % of amacrine neurons [ 38 ] , and are critical for both direction selectivity [ 34,35 ] and spontaneous <termsem="GO:0048511"> rhythmic activity </term> that occurs during normal <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> [ 36 ] .
SACs in the INL synapse in the OFF layer of the IPL that <termsem="GO:0050896"> responds </term> to decreasing light , while displaced SACs in the GCL have processes that synapse in the nearby ON layer of the IPL that <termsem="GO:0050896"> responds </term> to increasing light ( reviewed in [ 39 ] ) .
Mature SAC processes stain specifically for Slc18a3 ( vesicular <termsem="GO:0005277"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> acetyl choline transporter </term> </term> , VAChT ) [ 37 ] , and , significantly , this marker was absent in the peripheral Rb KO or Rb/E2f1 DKO P18 retina ( Figures 3A and S7B ) .
<termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> from the same locus , is also SAC specific , but marks both cell bodies and processes of mature SACs [ 37 ] .
<termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> was seen in fewer cells in the mature Rb KO retina , and was present in the soma but absent from processes ( Figure 3B ) .
We obtained similar results for Sv2c , a synaptic vesicle protein found in SACs [ 40 ] ; Kcnc1b and Kcnc2 , <termsem="GO:0005267"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> potassium channels </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> on SAC soma and dendrites as well as a very small number of ganglion cells [ 41 ] ; gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , an inhibitory neurotransmitter present in about half of amacrine cells including SACs , as well as horizontal and some bipolar neurons [ 37 ] ; and Calb1 ( calbindin ) , which is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in many amacrine cells and labels SAC process faintly ( Figure S7A and S7B ; Table S1 ; and data not shown ) .
Finally , we also examined the effect of Rb deletion on SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> using a Chx10-Cre transgene that is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in a mosaic pattern across the retina , <termsem="GO:0032502"> generating </term> patches of Cre - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> cells [ 42 ] .
Consistent with the mosaic deletion pattern , we observed markedly reduced <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> / Slc18a3 staining in the IPL of Chx10-Cre ; RbloxP/loxP retina compared to WT ( Figure S7C ) .
Together , these results suggest a role for Rb in SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
The above findings could indicate a defect in SAC <termsem="GO:0001708"> specification </term> , SAC survival , or the levels and/or <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> of the markers described above .
Camk2a marks both SACs and ganglion cells [ 37 ] , but because ganglion cells are <termsem="GO:0012501"> eliminated </term> in the Rb KO retina , Camk2a is a specific SAC marker in this context .
Importantly , Camk2a + tracks and dendrites were present in both the WT and Rb KO retina ( Figure 3B ) , and the number of Camk2a + soma was similar in WT and Rb KO retina at P30 and beyond , although fewer cells stained in Rb KO retina at P18 , suggesting a delay in its appearance ( Figures 3C and S6B ) .
Thus , Rb is not required for SAC survival or for process outgrowth , but rather it seems to <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and/or stability of Calb2 , Calb1 , <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> , Slc18a3 , Sv2c , Kcnc1b , Kcnc2 , and GABA in SACs , but leaves Camk2a <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> virtually unaffected .
The presence of <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> in some cell bodies but never in processes ( Figure 3B ) also suggests a <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> defect .
The <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> pattern of Slc18a3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> also supported this notion .
In mature WT SACs Slc18a3 is only in processes , but in early postnatal SACs , it is found in the cell body , and <termsem="GO:0006810"> moves </term> into emerging processes at approximately P4 -- P6 .
As noted above , Slc18a3 was absent at P18 in the Rb KO retina ( Figure 3A ) ; at P4 or P5 it was in cell bodies , yet was rarely present in Rb KO processes ( Figures 4A and S6 ) .
Slc18a3 became virtually undetectable in Rb KO SACs by P8 ( Figures 3C and S6C ) .
These data suggest that Rb affects both the <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> / stability and <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> of SAC markers .
E2f3 Loss Rescues <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> of Rb KO SACs .
( A ) Horizontal retinal sections of the indicated ages and genotypes were stained for nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) , <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> marker PH3 ( green ) , and Slc18a3 ( red ) , which marks SAC soma at early stages and processes from ~ P5 onwards .
Arrows show <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> PH3 + nuclei in Rb KO , Rb/E2f2 DKO , and Rb/E2f3 DKO retinas .
E2f1 loss rescues the ectopic <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> and <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> defects , but not the SAC defect .
E2f2 loss has no effect .
E2f3 loss does not rescue the ectopic <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> and cell loss defects , but rescues the SAC defect .
Inactivating E2f1 and E2f3 together rescues the ectopic <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> , <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> , and SAC defects .
( B ) The fraction of Camk2a + cells that are <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> + and Slc18a3 + in the P30 retina .
( C ) Horizontal P5 retinal sections were stained for nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) , Slc18a3 ( green ) , and Isl1 ( red ) .
Arrows show double-labelled Isl1 + / Slc18a3 + cells in the inner INL .
( D ) Horizontal P0 retinal sections of the indicated genotypes were stained for nuclei ( DAPI , blue ) , <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> marker Mki67 ( green ) , and Isl1 ( red ) .
Arrows show double-labelled <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> SACs .
( E ) The fraction of Isl1 + cells in the inner NBL ( INBL ) of P0 retinas that are <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> ( Mki67 + ) .
Error bars represent SD of measurements from three animals , and asterisks indicate significant differences between retinas of WT and the indicated genotypes ( * , p < 0.05 ; ** ; p < 0.01 ; ANOVA and Tukey HSD test ) .
Scale bars in ( A ) , ( C ) , and ( D ) are 50 m .
Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulates </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> through E2f3 .
Rb <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> more than 100 proteins [ 43 ] and in some non-neuronal cells , such as skeletal muscle , adipocytes , and bone , Rb is thought to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> and <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiate </term> tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> that <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 31 -- 33 ] .
Thus , we expected that Rb might interact with retina-specific factors to facilitate SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
A direct role for E2f in mediating Rb-dependent <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects ( independent of <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> or death defects ) has to our knowledge not been described , but because E2f can <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> some <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> genes [ 44 -- 48 ] , we first tested whether E2f2 or E2f3 might perturb Rb KO SAC <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> .
At multiple time points , E2f1 deletion <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> ( PH3 + cells ) , but did not reverse the SAC defect , and E2f2 deletion had no effect on either defect ( Figure 4A ) .
Remarkably , although E2f3 deletion did not reverse ectopic <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> , it rescued Calb2 , Slc18a3 , <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> , GABA , Kcnc1b , Kcnc2 , and Sv2c staining at multiple times ( Figure 4A and data not shown ) .
Rb/E2f3 DKO SAC tracks were slightly more disordered than in WT retina , most likely because of the absence of synaptic partner cells , which are <termsem="GO:0012501"> killed </term> by E2f1 .
Indeed , this minor defect was rescued in the Rb/E2f1/E2f3 triple knockout retina , where bipolar and ganglion <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> was rescued and SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> was restored ( Figure 4A ) .
E2f3 deletion alone did not affect SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> ( Figure 4A ) ; thus , it is unleashed E2f3 activity that is detrimental , and the critical role for Rb is to inhibit E2f3 .
We quantified the fraction of Camk2a + SACs in different genotypes and found that 60 % of WT P30 Camk2a + cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> and Slc18a3 , which dropped to only 5.6 % in the Rb KO retina , and remained low at 3.7 % in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina , but rose to 91 % in the Rb/E2f3 DKO retina ( Figure 4B ) .
The latter fraction is higher than WT because ganglion cells , which normally make up ~ 40 % of Camk2a + cells , are <termsem="GO:0012501"> killed </term> by <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> .
To quantify the effect of different E2fs on ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> specifically in SACs , we exploited Isl1 ( Islet1 ) .
This marker is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in both SACs and ganglion cells , thus Isl1 + cells in the INL are exclusively SACs [ 49 ] .
We found that 98.2 %  1.8 % of Isl1 + cells in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> inner INL at P5 were also Slc18a3 + , confirming that Isl1 is an excellent SAC marker ( Figure 4C ) .
Moreover , Isl1 , unlike Slc18a3 , is nuclear , which facilitates scoring of Isl1 + / Mki67 + cells .
It is also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> earlier than Slc18a3 , permitting analysis of SACs soon after their birth at ~ E15 ; thus , we could study retina at P0 , a time when ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> is high in the inner retina and prior to Rb-independent <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit associated with terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 2 ] .
At P0 , no WT Isl1 + cells in the inner neuroblastic layer ( NBL ) ( which is the future INL ) were <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> , but 57  14 Isl1 + / Mki67 + cells were detected in the Rb KO inner NBL ( Figure 4D ) .
Indeed , about one-third of all Isl1 + cells in the entire inner NBL were <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> in the Rb KO retina , or ~ 50 % in the periphery where Cre is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> ( Figure 4E and data not shown ) .
This defect was <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina , where we detected only 1  1 <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> SAC , but not the Rb/E2f3 DKO retina , where there were 53  8 <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> SACs ( Figure 4D and 4E ) .
We observed similar effects at P0 with Calb2 , which marks newborn SACs and other amacrine cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , in Rb KO SACs , E2f1 deletion <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppresses </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> but not aberrant <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , whereas E2f3 deletion <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppresses </term> aberrant <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> but not ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> .
Specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of E2f3 in SACs and Other Subsets of CNS Neurons .
The unique effect of E2f3 in disrupting the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of SACs but not other retinal neurons might be due to cell-type-specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> or cell-type-specific activity of E2f3 .
Determining between these two possibilities is not easy , as E2f immunostaining in mouse tissues is problematic .
We did not solve this issue for E2f1 or E2f2 , but used a modified protocol [ 50 ] to successfully track E2f3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 5 ) .
At P0 , E2f3 was detected in RPCs , consistent with a putative role in normal <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> ( Figure 5A ) .
The signal was specific as it was absent in the E2f3 KO peripheral retina ( Figure 5A ) .
As the retina <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> and RPC <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> diminished , the number of E2f3 + cells also dropped , and by P8 , when <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> is virtually over , only a subset of post - <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> cells in the inner retina <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> E2f3 ( Figure 5A ) .
By P18 , E2f3 was also detected in two tracks in the IPL ( Figure 5A and 5B ) , reminiscent of SAC markers such as <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> and Slc18a3 ( c.f. Figures 3 and 4 ) .
This cytoplasmic E2f3 staining was also specific , as it was absent in the E2f3 KO peripheral retina of -Cre ; E2f3loxP/loxP mice ( Figure 5A ) .
Indeed , double labelling with E2f3 ( red ) and <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> plus Slc18a3 ( green ) confirmed that E2f3 is present in both SAC soma and dendrites ( Figure 5B ) .
Rb protein was also detected in the inner retina ( Figure 5A ) , and showed a similar <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> as E2f3 in SACs ( Figure 5B ) , and was also present in mature ganglion cells and Mller cells as reported [ 51 ] .
Rb staining in SAC processes was specific as it was absent in the peripheral retina of Cre ; RbloxP/loxP mice ( Figure 5A ) .
These data suggest that Rb and E2f3 colocalize in SACs and that E2f3 triggers defects in SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> because it is specifically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in these retinal neurons .

Arrows indicate double-labelled soma .
Note that the IPL processes are also double-labelled .
Scale bars are 50 m .
We also found that E2f3 is present in a specific subset of mature neurons in various brain regions ( data not shown ) .
For example , in the P20 amygdala , E2f3 colocalized with the general neuronal markers Mtap2 and Mecp2 [ 52 ] , but not with Calb2 , which marks a subset of neurons , or with the glial marker Gfap ( data not shown ) .
Unlike in retinal SACs , E2f3 was not coexpressed in <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> + or Slc18a3 + cholinergic neurons located in various regions of the brain and spinal cord ( data not shown ) .
In agreement , we could not detect defects in cholinergic Rb KO neurons in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> forebrain , but other Rb KO neurons in this region showed <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects that were rescued by deleting E2f3 [ 53 ] .
Together , these results suggest that the common mechanism by which Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> neural <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is through E2f3 inhibition .
Distinct <termsem="GO:0051179"> Localization </term> of E2f3 Isoforms .
As noted above , E2f3 and Rb staining in SACs was both nuclear and cytoplasmic ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
The antibody that worked in immunostaining recognizes a C-terminal region and thus , does not distinguish a/b isoforms .
To our knowledge , the subcellular location of E2f3 isoforms has not been determined in any cell type .
To verify the dual locations of E2f3 and to determine which isoforms were present in retina , we analyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions by Western blot at different times during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Analysis with the pan-E2f3 antibody ( sc-878 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) detected a 55-kD E2f3a species and a 40-kD E2f3b polypeptide ( Figure 6 ) .
To confirm that the upper species in our retinal lysates was E2f3a , we exploited novel mice that lack E2f3 exon 1a and thus <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> E2f3b exclusively ( R. O. and G. L. , unpublished data ) .
The genotyping strategy is discussed in detail later and is outlined in Figure 7A .
Western analysis confirmed that the upper band was absent in E2f3a  /  mice ( Figures 6 and S8 ) .
Consistent with the drop in E2f3 - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> cells during WT retinal <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> ( Figure 5A ) , the total amount of E2f3a was less at P18 compared to P0 ( Figure 6 ) .
E2f3b was present in similar amounts at both time points .
At P0 and P18 , E2f3a was present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions , but in marked contrast , E2f3b was exclusively nuclear at both times ( Figure 6 ) .
Two closely migrating E2f3a bands were detected , more clearly evident at P18 , of which the faster migrating species was dominant in nuclear and the slower species was dominant in cytoplasm ( Figure 6 ) .
The identity of both as E2f3a species was confirmed by their absence in the P18 E2f3a KO retina ( Figure S8 ) .
Analysis of Pou4f2 , a nuclear <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in ganglion cells , showed that nuclear proteins had not contaminated the cytoplasmic fraction , and analysis of Slc18a3 , a cytoplasmic SAC marker , confirmed that the reverse had also not occurred ( Figure 6 ) .
These data show , to our knowledge for the first time , that E2f3a and E2f3b exhibit distinct patterns of <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular distribution </term> , and raise the possibility that E2f3a <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by as yet unknown <termsem="GO:0043687"> post - <termsem="GO:0006412"> translational </term> modifications </term> .

We also examined the <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of other <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> regulators during <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> .
Like E2f3a , Rb was present in both the WT cytoplasm and nucleus at P0 , but at P18 , when the levels of Rb had increased , it was primarily nuclear ( Figure 6 ) .
A very faint cytoplasmic Rb signal was evident at P18 , which is consistent with Rb staining of SAC processes ( Figure 5B ) , and with the very small proportion of SACs in the retina [ 38 ] .
E2f1 was also detected in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions , although unlike E2f3a it was predominantly nuclear both at P0 and P18 ( Figure 6 ) .
The E2f <termsem="GO:0046983"> dimerization </term> partner , Tfdp1 , which lacks a nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> signal [ 54 ] , was primarily cytoplasmic at both P0 and P18 , and the <termsem="GO:0004861"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0004693"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Cdk </term> </term> inhibitors </term> </term> Cdkn1a and Cdkn1b showed a similar pattern of <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> ( Figure 6 ) .
Thus , among the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> regulators we examined , most showed bivalent <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> , and E2f3b was unusual in its solely nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> compartmentalization </term> .
Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulates </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> through E2f3a .
To test which E2f3 isoform is responsible for aberrant Rb KO SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> we exploited E2f3a  /  mice ( Figure 7A ) .
The genotyping strategy outlined in Figure 7A was used to distinguish the E2f3a , WT , and null alleles .
<termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Reverse transcriptase </term> </term> PCR ( <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> - PCR ) confirmed the presence of both E2f3a and E2f3b RNA species in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> WT retina , and the specific absence of E2f3a RNA in the E2f3a  /  retina ( Figure 7B ) .
E2f3a protein was absent in E2f3a  /  retinal lysate ( Figures 6 and S8 ) .
Importantly , the levels of E2f3b message were similar in the Rb KO and Rb/E2f3a DKO retina , ruling out the possibility that any effects of E2f3a deletion we might observe were due to <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of E2f3b ( Figure 7C ) .
Also , the levels of other E2fs were the same in the Rb KO , Rb/E2f3 DKO , and Rb/E2f3a DKO retina , ruling out any cross - <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> effects ( Figure 7C ) [ 55 ] .
E2f3a can trigger <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> induction , but because SAC defects are not linked to <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> perturbation ( Figures 3A and 4 ) , and in view of the predominant association between E2f3b and Rb in quiescent cells [ 16,19 ] , we suspected that E2f3b may perturb <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in Rb KO SACs .
Unexpectedly , however , E2f3a deletion <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> the Rb KO SAC defect ( Figure 7D ) .
Thus , separate from its role in <termsem="GO:0051726"> <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> control </term> , Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of E2f3a is critical to ensure proper neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> Controls </term> Retinal <termsem="GO:0051301"> Cell Division </term> and Death through E2f1 .
Work in the early 1990s showed that Rb loss triggers defects in neuronal <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit , survival , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 26 -- 28 ] .
Much of the <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> is an indirect consequence of probable hypoxia linked to placental defects [ 12 -- 14 ] .
However , targeted KO and chimeric studies reveal that Rb autonomously <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> exit in newborn neurons , and is required for survival of a subset of neurons , particularly in the retina [ 2,3,13,14,56 -- 59 ] .
However , whether Rb also <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulates </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> is obscured by potentially indirect effects of ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> .
Moreover , a mechanism though which Rb may <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0042551"> neuronal maturation </term> has not been elucidated .
Here , deleting E2f1 specifically rescued ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> in the Rb KO retina .
Importantly , major Rb/E2f1 DKO neurons <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> normally , and ERGs revealed the rescue of rod - and cone-mediated function , implicating a regular <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal flow </term> from photoreceptors to bipolar and amacrine cells .
<termsem="GO:0051301"> Division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> genes were induced in Rb KO cells , and deleting E2f1 , but not E2f2 or E2f3 , reversed these molecular events .
E2f1 may also <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> targets , but whether this contributes to defects in retinal <termsem="GO:0048469"> cell maturation </term> is impossible to separate from potentially indirect consequences of deregulated <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> .
In any case , it is clear that in most retinal cells , including photoreceptors [ 29 ] , <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> that <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> function independently of Rb .
We have also found that E2f1 deletion rescues cell-autonomous ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> , <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in sporadic Rb KO clones <termsem="GO:0032502"> generated </term> using a Cre retrovirus vector ( M. P. and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
These data are consistent with the observation that E2f1 overexpression in newborn photoreceptors <termsem="GO:0048518"> drives </term> ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> [ 60 ] , and add to the growing evidence indicating that E2f1 is the major , and perhaps only , member of the three activating E2fs required to induce apoptosis in Rb KO cells [ 10,15 ] .
Thus , deregulated E2f1 activity in the retina , whether resulting from the inactivation of Rb or from overexpression , <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> unscheduled <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> and triggers <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> in susceptible RTCs .
E2f1 , rather than other E2fs , may be a potential target for novel therapeutics to prevent retinoblastoma in RB1 + /  humans .
Our ERG studies revealed rescue of the Rb KO rod -- bipolar system , and almost complete restoration of the cone -- bipolar system following E2f1 deletion .
There was a slightly lower <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina relative to the E2f1 KO control retina .
This difference might reflect a role for Rb in the <termsem="GO:0046549"> development of cones </term> , bipolar cells , or other cells that may contribute to the photopic ERG , including potentially SACs , which do have a serious defect in the Rb/E2f1 DKO retina .
Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> Controls </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> through E2f3a .
Comprehensive marker analysis revealed that , in striking contrast to other retinal neurons , E2f1 deletion did not <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> defects in Rb KO cholinergic SACs .
Instead , we observed E2f1-independent defects in the synthesis and transport of a large cohort of SAC proteins .
These data expand insight into the <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of these important interneurons , but more critically , provide to our knowledge the first unambiguous evidence that Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulates </term> <termsem="GO:0022008"> neurogenesis </term> beyond terminal <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitosis </term> .
Rb <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> more than 100 factors [ 43 ] , and in several non-neuronal cells , such as skeletal muscle , adipocytes , and bone , it <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> and <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiates </term> tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> that <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 31 -- 33 ] .

Strikingly , however , we discovered that Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f3 ( Figure 8 ) .

Rb performs this function by inhibiting E2f1 .
Rb is also required for SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , and in this case , acts by inhibiting E2f3a .

Rb regulation of SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f3 was independent of its role in <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlling </term> <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> or <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> : E2f3 deletion rescued Rb KO SAC defects but did not <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppress </term> aberrant <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> or <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> , whereas E2f1 deletion reversed abnormal <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> but did not rescue SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Double labelling confirmed that E2f1 but not E2f3 deletion reversed Rb KO SAC <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> .
Moreover , deleting E2f1 , but not E2f3 , reversed deregulated expression of <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> genes in the Rb KO retina .
E2f3 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in a subset of CNS neurons ( this work ) and <termsem="GO:0048518"> drives </term> specific <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell-cycle </term> -- independent defects in Rb KO forebrain neurons [ 53 ] .
Thus , E2f3 inhibition is the first , and may be the only , mechanism by which Rb participates directly in neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
To further dissect the mechanism of action of Rb in SACs we determined the E2f3 isoform it targets to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
E2f3b was the primary candidate , since Rb and E2f3b collaborate to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repress </term> targets in quiescent cells in vitro [ 19 ] .
However , in the first work to our knowledge to examine the function of any E2f protein isoform in vivo , we made the surprising observation that Rb <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulates </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f3a ( Figure 8 ) .
Formally , we can not exclude the possibility that deleting E2f3b might also rescue SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , but definitive proof will require analysis of E2f3b null mice .
Nevertheless , our data prove that Rb definitely <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulates </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through the activating E2f3 isoform .
Distinct E2f3a and E2f3b <termsem="GO:0051179"> Localization </term> .
The subcellular location of E2f isoforms has not to our knowledge been addressed before .
E2f3a and E2f3b share 110 C-terminal amino acids that encode the NLS , <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> , marked box , transactivation , and Rb - <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> domains [ 16 ] , yet they exhibit different <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular distribution </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> retinal cells .
E2f3a is both nuclear and cytoplasmic , but E2f3b is always nuclear .
The unique 121 - and six-residue N-termini of E2f3a and E2f3b , respectively , likely mediate this difference .
This region in E2f1 , E2f2 , and E2f3a <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> Ccna2 , establishing a <termsem="GO:0048519"> negative regulatory </term> loop that deactivates E2fs in mid-late <termsem="GO:0051320"> S-phase </term> [ 64,65 ] .
However , even E2f3b , which lacks this domain , <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> and is <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by Ccna2 [ 18 ] , so the domain difference may not explain the unique <termsem="GO:0051179"> distributions </term> we observed .
Rb family and Tfdp proteins can also determine E2f <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> [ 20 -- 22 ] , and we found that a portion of both Rb and Tfdp1 proteins are cytoplasmic in retinal cells .
Indeed , immunostaining revealed that Rb and E2f3 colocalize to SAC processes .
The nuclear <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of E2f3b contrasts with that of other <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressive </term> E2fs in <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> muscle , where E2f5 <termsem="GO:0006810"> switches </term> from the nucleus to cytoplasm , while E2f4 <termsem="GO:0051235"> remains </term> in both compartments [ 23 ] .
The distinct <termsem="GO:0051179"> compartmentalization </term> of E2f3a and E2f3b in the retina suggests temporally and functionally distinct activities .
Rb <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> matches that of E2f3a , consistent with its critical role in <termsem="GO:0048518"> supporting </term> SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through E2f3a .
Ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> Division </term> and <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> .
Rb is critical to ensure that many types of terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> cells leave the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> ( e.g. , neurons , gut and skin epithelia , muscle , and lens fibres ) ( reviewed in [ 66 ] ) .
Early overexpression studies in vitro suggested Rb might <termsem="GO:0048519"> temper </term> <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of cycling cells , but KO studies in vivo indicate that its major role is to block <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> in terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> cells .
In its absence , many ( but clearly not all ) aspects of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> go ahead relatively unperturbed .
In the retina , <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> transition cells are born in the absence of Rb , <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> to the correct layer , and <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> appropriate markers ( [ 2 ] and this work ) .
In brain , Rb KO neurons <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> away from the ventricular zone and switch on Tubb3 ( III-tubulin ) , but continue to incorporate BrdU [ 13 ] , and in gut epithelia , <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> enterocytes <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> up the villi and activate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of serotonin , yet continue to incorporate BrdU [ 67 ] .
In the case of SACs , the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects we observed ( e.g. , loss of Slc18a3 and <termsem="GO:0004102"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chat </term> </term> ) were not due to aberrant <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> , but it is possible there are other problems with these cells that are caused by ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> .
Nevertheless , it is clear that many aspects of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in multiple cell types are compatible with ectopic <termsem="GO:0051301"> division </term> .
However , division of terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiating </term> cells is dangerous , since it may facilitate <termsem="GO:0030154"> transformation </term> , as is the case in retinoblastoma ( reviewed in [ 66 ] ) .
How Does E2f3a Perturb SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> ?
E2f3a could disrupt SAC <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> through its well known role as a <termsem="GO:0016563"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> activator </term> </term> , or , in view of the discovery that it is partially cytoplasmic , E2f3a may affect processes other than gene <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> .
Both scenarios are feasible since E2fs <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> genes [ 44 -- 48 ] , and <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> regulators , such as Cdkn1b , have cytoplasmic activities that influence <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 68,69 ] .
Many <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0006810"> shuttle </term> between nucleus and cytoplasm during <termsem="GO:0022008"> neurogenesis </term> ( e.g. , [ 70 ] and references therein ) .
It may be difficult to identify E2f3a-specific target genes or cytoplasmic proteins in SACs since these neurons are a small proportion ( < 1 % ) of the total retina and only ~ 5.2 % of amacrine neurons [ 38 ] .
Do E2fs Mediate All Rb Functions ?
Others have suggested that Rb <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> differentiation in non-neuronal cells through E2f-independent means [ 31 -- 33 ] .
However , these studies did not assess whether these cell types <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> normally if Rb is deleted along with one or more E2f family members .
One study reported that Rb mutants that do not <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> E2f still <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 30 ] .
However , the <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> assays were performed in solution , and we have found that several of these mutants do <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> E2f , albeit weakly , on chromatin ( T. Yu and R. B. , unpublished data ) .
It is possible that Rb-mediated <termsem="GO:0048518"> potentiation </term> of tissue-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> may , at least in some cases , be a redundant activity , and that the only critical Rb function is to inhibit E2f .
Our study is the first to our knowledge to assess comprehensively whether Rb KO cells can <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> in the absence of different E2fs .
In light of our findings , it will be important to reassess <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> defects in other Rb KO tissues in the absence of individual and combined activating E2f family members .
Mouse strains and genotyping .
Mice were treated according to institutional and national guidelines .
-Cre mice ( P. Gruss ) , Chx10-Cre mice ( C. Cepko ) , RbloxP/loxP mice ( A. Berns ) , E2f1 -- / -- mice , E2f2 -- / -- mice , E2f3loxP/loxP mice , and E2f3a  /  mice were maintained on a mixed ( NMRI  C57/Bl  FVB/N  129sv ) background .
A detailed description of E2f3a  /  mice will be published elsewhere .
Mice of different genotypes were compared within the same litter and across a minimum of three litters .
We have not noted any phenotypic differences in separate litters .
Genotyping was performed as before [ 2,5 ] , and the primers used for genotyping E2f3a  /  mice were E2f3a KL ( 5  - CTCCAGACCCCCGATTATTT-3  ) , E2f3a KR1 ( 5  - TCCAGTGCACTACTCCCTCC-3  ) , and E2f3a KM ( 5  - GCTAGCAGTGCCCTTTTGTC-3  ) .
Histology , immunofluorescence , and measurements .
Eyeballs were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 C , embedded in OCT ( TissueTek 4583 , Sakura , http://www.sakuraeu.com ) , frozen on dry ice , and cut into 12-m sections on Superfrost plus slides ( VWR , http://www.vwr.com ) .
For <termsem="GO:0051320"> S-phase </term> analysis , BrdU ( 100 g/g of body weight ) was injected intraperitoneally 2 h prior to sacrifice .
BrdU + cells were detected using a <termsem="GO:0009305"> biotin-conjugated </term> sheep polyclonal antibody ( 1:500 , Maine Biotechnology Services , http://www.mainebiotechnology.com ) .
All other antibodies are described in Table S1 .
For E2f3 , Mki67 , and Rb staining , antigen retrieval was performed by boiling sections in citric acid solution for 15 min according to Ino [ 50 ] , except on frozen sections .
TUNEL was performed as described [ 13 ] .
Briefly , sections were incubated for 1 h at 37 C with 75 l of mixture solution consisting of 0.5 l of <termsem="GO:0003912"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> terminal deoxynucleotide transferase </term> </term> , 1 l of biotin-16-dUTP , 7.5 l of CoCl2 , 15 l of 5  <termsem="GO:0003912"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> terminal deoxynucleotide transferase </term> </term> buffer , and 51 l of distilled water .
After three washes in 4  SSC buffer , sections were incubated with Alexa 488 -- or Alexa 568  streptavidin ( 1:1,000 ; Molecular Probes , http://probes.invitrogen.com ) for 1 h at room temperature .
Primary antibodies or labelled cells were visualized using donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 , donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 , donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 , and streptavidin Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 ( 1:1,000 ; Molecular Probes ) .
Nuclei were counter-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole ( DAPI ; Sigma , http://www.sigmaaldrich.com ) .
Labelled cells were visualized using a Zeiss ( http://www.zeiss.com ) Axioplan-2 microscope with Plan Neofluar objectives and images captured with a Zeiss AxionCam camera .
For double-labelled samples , confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 5.0 laser scanning microscope .
The retina was separated into three bins by dividing the ventricular edge of the retina into equal parts and extending a line to the vitreal edge [ 2 ] .
Bin 1 contains only cells that <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> Cre as progenitors ; bin 3 is at central retina and contains cells derived from progenitors that did not <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Cre .
For cell counts or thickness measurement we used a region 0 -- 100 m peripheral to the boundary separating bins 1 and 2 .
Measurements were performed on an Axioplan-2 microscope using Axiovison software .
Quantification of <termsem="GO:0051320"> S-phase </term> , <termsem="GO:0000279"> M-phase </term> , and <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> cells was performed on horizontal sections that included the optic nerve .
Quantification of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> cell types was performed using horizontal sections at equal distances from the optic nerve .
A minimum of three sections per eye and three eyes from different litters were counted .
RNA extraction , <termsem="GO:0006410"> reverse transcription </term> , and PCR .
Total RNA was isolated from dissected peripheral retina using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , http://www.invitrogen.com ) followed by <termsem="GO:0009056"> digestion </term> with <termsem="GO:0004540"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RNase </term> </term> - free <termsem="GO:0004536"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DNase </term> </term> ( DNA-free , Ambion , http://www.ambion.com ) to remove DNA contamination .
First-strand cDNA was <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesized </term> from 0.2 -- 0.5 g of total RNA using the SuperScript II first-strand <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> system ( Invitrogen ) .
PCR primers are listed in Table S2 .
Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems ( http://appliedbiosystems.com ) PRISM 7900HT .
Tests were run in duplicate on three separate biological samples with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) exactly as we described previously [ 71 ] .
Briefly , master stocks were prepared such that each 10-l reaction contained 5 l of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix , 0.1 l of each forward and reverse primer ( stock 50 M ) , 0.8 l of blue H2O ( 0.73 % Blue Food Colour ; McCormick , http://www.mccormick.com ) , 2 l of diluted cDNA template , and 2 l of yellow H2O ( 0.73 % Yellow Food Colour ) .
PCR consisted of 40 cycles of <termsem="GO:0032508"> denaturation </term> at 95 C for 15 s and <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> annealing </term> </term> and <termsem="GO:0006354"> <termsem="GO:0022616"> extension </term> </term> at 55 C for 30 s .
An additional cycle ( 95 C , 15 s , 60 C ) generated a dissociation curve to confirm a single product .
The cycle quantity required to reach a threshold in the linear range was determined and compared to a standard curve for each primer set generated by five 3-fold dilutions of genomic DNA or cDNA samples of known concentration .
Values obtained for test RNAs were normalized to Hprt1 mRNA levels .
Western blots .
Mouse retinas were homogenized by passing them through a 30-gauge BD 9 http://www.bd.com ) needle 5 -- 10 times in 1  PBS solution .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit ( Product # 78833 , Pierce Biotechnology , http://www.piercenet.com ) .
Proteins were separated by 10 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose .
After blocking overnight at 4 C in 5 % skim milk , membranes were incubated in the primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature .
After three 10-min washes in TPBS ( 100 mM Na2HPO4 , 100 mM NaH2PO4 , 0.5 N NaCl , 0.1 % Tween-20 ) , membranes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the secondary horseradish <termsem="GO:0004601"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> peroxidase </term> </term> - <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , http://www.jacksonimmuno.com ) .

Electroretinography .
ERGs were recorded from dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> mice as described [ 72 ] .
Briefly , mice were dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> overnight and anaesthetized by subcutaneous injection of ketamine ( 66.7 mg/kg body weight ) and xylazine ( 11.7 mg/kg body weight ) .
The pupils were dilated and single-flash ERG recordings were obtained under dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ( scotopic ) and light - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ( photopic ) conditions .
Light <termsem="GO:0022401"> adaptation </term> was accomplished with a background illumination of 30 candela ( cd ) per square meter starting 10 min before recording .
Single white-flash stimulation ranged from 10  4 to 25 cd  s/m2 , divided into ten steps of 0.5 and 1 log cd  s/m2 .
Ten <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> were averaged with an inter-stimulus interval of either 5 s ( for 10  4 , 10  3 , 10  2 , 3  10  2 , 10  1 , and 3  10  1 cd  s/m2 ) or 17 s ( for 1 , 3 , 10 , and 25 cd  s/m2 ) .
Band-pass filter cut-off frequencies were 0.1 and 3,000 Hz .
