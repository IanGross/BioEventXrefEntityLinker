Spontaneous Autoimmunity in 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mice </term> -- Implications for Autoimmunity Described in Gene-Targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mice </term> .
Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder in which complex genetic factors play an important role .
Several strains of gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> have been reported to develop SLE , implicating the null genes in the causation of disease .
However , hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , widely used in the generation of gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , develop spontaneous autoimmunity .
Furthermore , the genetic background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype of SLE in gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
This suggests an important role in the expression of autoimmunity of as-yet-uncharacterised background genes originating from these parental <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strains .
Using genome-wide linkage analysis , we identified several susceptibility loci , derived from 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , mapped in the lupus-prone hybrid ( 129  C57BL/6 ) model .
By creating a C57BL/6 congenic strain carrying a 129-derived Chromosome 1 segment , we found that this 129 interval was sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens , which had previously been attributed to a disrupted gene .
These results demonstrate important epistatic modifiers of autoimmunity in 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strains , widely used in gene targeting .
These background gene influences may account for some , or even all , of the autoimmune traits described in some gene-targeted models of SLE .
Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies ( auto-Abs ) against a wide spectrum of self-antigens , mainly from subcellular compartments , especially the cell nucleus .
Genetic predisposition is an important contributor to susceptibility to SLE in both <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> ( Vyse and Todd 1996 ; Harley et al. 1998 ; Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999 ; Wakeland et al. 2001 ) .
Genes in multiple pathways participate in mediating disease pathogenesis , and epistatic interactions amongst these genes influence the expression of disease .
In this context , both genetic linkage studies in spontaneous lupus-prone models and synthetic <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> models of autoimmunity generated by targeted disruption of specific genes modulating the immune system have widely been used to investigate the complexity of SLE .
The best-studied strains of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that spontaneously develop a lupus-like pathology are the New Zealand Black/New Zealand White hybrid strain ( NZB/WF1 ) ; the MRL/Mp lpr/lpr strain , which carries the lpr mutation of the FAS receptor gene ; and the BXSB strain , which carries the Y chromosome autoimmune accelerator ( Yaa ) gene ( Theofilopoulos and Dixon 1985 ) .
Extensive genetic mapping studies in all three strains have identified multiple intervals associated with disease susceptibility .
Interestingly , the majority of the intervals detected are strain-specific , confirming the genetic complexity of the disease and indicating the presence of extensive heterogeneity in the genes contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease .
However , some susceptibility loci have been mapped to similar chromosome locations in different strains , suggesting that at least some susceptibility may be shared amongst lupus-prone strains .
Amongst these shared susceptibility loci , the most striking are loci on distal Chromosome 1 , for which important contributing genes have been found in New Zealand and BXSB models ( Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999 ; Wakeland et al. 2001 ) .
Although considerable efforts have been made to identify the genes responsible for the development of the disease , with the exception of the lpr mutation , none of the genetic contributions to disease in the three well-documented <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> SLE strains have yet been fully resolved at the molecular or protein level .
Thus , targeted genetic disruption of candidate genes encoding proteins of the immune system has been extensively used to examine their role in immune regulation .
However , the most surprising result of this powerful approach has been the high frequency with which such mutations have been associated with an autoimmune phenotype .
In this regard , it is of note that hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , widely used in the generation of gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , are spontaneously predisposed to development of humoral autoimmunity with low levels of glomerulonephritis ( Obata et al. 1979 ; Botto et al. 1998 ; Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ) .
Furthermore , the genetic background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype in gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ; Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
These observations led to the hypothesis that the autoimmune phenotype described in some gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> might be due primarily to combinations of as-yet-uncharacterised background genes , originating from 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> strains , interacting or not with the mutated allele .
To test this , we conducted a genome-wide scan analysis of two large cohorts of ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , one of which carried a mutation in the serum amyloid P component gene ( Apcs ) .
The Apcs-deficient <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( Apcs  /  ) were chosen as an example of a gene-targeted strain previously reported to develop a lupus-like disease on the hybrid genetic background ( 129  C57BL/6 ) ; autoimmunity in Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> persists even after backcrossing the mutated gene onto C57BL/6 ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) .
We chose this targeted gene in particular to study since the Apcs gene is located on Chromosome 1 , approximately 94 cM from the centromere , within a region where several lupus-susceptibility loci , designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001 ) , Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995 ; Vyse et al. 1997 ) , and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998 ; Haywood et al. 2000 ) , have been mapped in NZW , NZB , and BXSB lupus-prone strains , respectively .
This region contains several genes , including those encoding FcRII , the complement receptor CR1/2 ( CD35/CD21 ) , and the decay-accelerating factor CD55 ( Prodeus et al. 1998 ; Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Miwa et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) , which have each been implicated in the causation of SLE when inactivated by gene-targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells .
Here we show that there are multiple genetic loci , derived from both 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , contributing to autoimmunity .
Furthermore , a 129-derived interval on distal Chromosome 1 , when transferred onto the C57BL/6 genome , a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 a gene that has been inactivated in 129 embryonic stem cells , was sufficient to cause humoral autoimmunity in its own right , irrespective of the presence of the mutated Apcs gene .
These results demonstrate important epistatic interactions between genes from 129 and C57BL/6 genomes on the development of autoimmunity and illustrate the important effects of background genes in the analysis and interpretation of autoimmune phenotypes associated with targeted genetic disruptions .
Disease Traits in ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 and ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mice </term> .
To investigate the genetic basis of the lupus-like disease observed in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , we generated two large cohorts of ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> , one carrying a mutation in the Apcs gene , and monitored them for 1 y under identical environmental conditions .
Since female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in the original reports showed a higher penetrance of disease , the present study was conducted only on female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
The results of the phenotypic analysis at 1 y of age are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 .
As previously reported ( Botto et al. 1998 ) , the wild-type ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> developed lupus traits with elevated levels of auto-Abs , starting from 6 mo of age ( data not shown ) , and histological evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis .
In agreement with our previous observations ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) , the titres of anti-nuclear Abs ( ANAs ) and anti-chromatin Ab were considerably greater in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> compared with the strain-matched controls .
However , in contrast to our original findings , the levels of the other two disease serological markers analysed ( anti-single-stranded DNA [ ssDNA ] and anti-double-stranded DNA [ dsDNA ] Abs ) and the severity of the renal pathology were not different between the two experimental groups .
In view of the possibility of an association between the fixed 129-derived segment flanking the mutated Apcs gene and the autoimmune traits observed , the genome-wide linkage analysis of the two experimental cohorts was carried out separately .
Mapping of Loci Predisposing to Lupus in the Hybrid Strain ( 129  C57BL/6 ) .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mice </term> were genotyped with 143 microsatellite markers distributed throughout the autosomes such that 98 % of the genes were within 20 cM of an informative marker .
A summary of the genome-wide linkage analysis for each of the disease traits measured is shown in Table 3 .
The areas of linkage were defined according to the parental origin , 129 or C57BL/6 .
Only linkages identified in both experimental groups are reported in Table 3 , with the exception of the Chromosome 1 distal segment , where the linkage analysis could not be applied to the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> as this region was of fixed 129 origin .
Chromosomes where linkages were present only in one of the two cohorts are shown in Figures 1 -- 3 .
The quantitative trait linkage ( QTL ) analysis identified several intervals on Chromosome 1 with linkage to disease serological markers , and these regions were all derived from the 129 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strain ( see Table 3 ; Figures 4 and 5 ) .
Interestingly , whilst ANA and anti-chromatin Ab levels showed suggestive or significant linkages only to the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 , with an estimated peak occurring at a position approximately 90 cM near the Apcs gene , anti-dsDNA or anti-ssDNA Ab production was also linked to other segments on Chromosome 1 , indicating a more complex genetic contribution from the 129 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strain .
Guided by these observations , we investigated whether the increased levels of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab observed in the Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were caused by a gene ( s ) within the fixed 129 region surrounding the mutated Apcs gene , rather than caused by the mutated Apcs gene itself .
We compared the levels of these auto-Abs between all ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and a group of 33 wild-type <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that were selected for being homozygous 129 in the region of Chromosome 1 between microsatellites D1Mit105 and D1Mit 223 ( 80 -- 106 cM ) ( Figure 6A -- 6D ) .
In contrast to the results reported in Table 1 , this comparison showed no significant differences between the two experimental groups .
This result demonstrates that , most likely , the 129-derived region and not the lack of Apcs was mediating the production of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab .
Consistent with this explanation , we found that the 129 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> have significantly higher levels of Apcs in circulation compared with the C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( median , 83 mg/l ; range , 25 -- 208 ; n = 16 versus median , 5 mg/l ; range , 4 -- 9 ; n = 10 , respectively ; p < 0.0001 ) .
The C57BL/6 strain has previously been reported to be one of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> strains defined as low Apcs producers ( Pepys et al. 1979 ; Baltz et al. 1980 ) .
In addition , sequence analysis of the entire Apcs coding region in both strains failed to identify any coding sequence polymorphisms in the Apcs gene ( data not shown ) , indicating that a structural variant of the protein is unlikely to be the explanation for our findings .
This is consistent with a previous report by Drake et al. ( 1996 ) that showed no Apcs coding sequence differences amongst several autoimmune and nonautoimmune <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> strains .
In addition to the 129-derived segments , in both cohorts the C57BL/6 strain contributed to the autoimmune traits with one major susceptibility locus on Chromosome 3 .
A genomic region between D3Mit40 and D3Mit13 , with an estimated peak at position approximately 51 cM , showed a significant linkage to ANA production and weaker linkages to anti-ssDNA and anti-chromatin production ( see Table 3 ; Figure 7 ) .
The high frequency of autoimmune phenotype in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid genetic background and its absence in either of the inbred parental strains imply that there are essential interactions between 129 - and C57BL/6-derived alleles for the expression of autoimmunity .
We investigated further the effects of genes from the C57BL/6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal Chromosome 1 , as previously described ( Zeng 1994 ) .
The results of this analysis showed that the statistical support for the linkage of the C57BL/6 locus on Chromosome 3 for ANA increased from logarithm of odds ( LOD ) 5.4 to LOD 6.4 .
In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers , the QTL analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis : one in the wild-type <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> on Chromosome 7 across a 10 cM region between D7Mit246 ( 15 cM ) and D7Mit145 ( 26.5 cM ) of 129 origin ( LOD 2.86 , p = 0.0013 ) , and one on Chromosome 17 between D17Mit100 ( 11.7 cM ) and D17Mit216 ( 29.4 cM ) from the C57BL/6 strain ( LOD 1.3 , p = 0.049 and LOD 1.67 , p = 0.021 in the wild-type and Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , respectively ) .
Histological evidence of glomerulonephritis was only found in approximately 20 % of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in each cohort , which reduces the power of the QTL analysis for this disease trait .
Production of a C57BL/6 .129 Chromosome 1 Congenic Line and Its Phenotypic Analysis .
We generated a C57BL/6 congenic line carrying the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 from the 129 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strain , in order to dissect the complex polygenic disease phenotype of the ( C57BL/6  129/Sv ) F2 hybrid strain into its individual genetic components .
The 129 interval was backcrossed seven times onto C57BL/6 , and at each generation the presence or absence of the Chromosome 1 interval was determined with several microsatellite markers .
Each backcrossed generation was screened with more than three markers per chromosome to facilitate the removal of unselected 129 genomic regions .
At the end of the backcrossing , the 129-derived Chromosome 1 interval in the congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> extended from microsatellite marker D1Mit105 to D1Mit223 ( 80 -- 106 cM ) , which encompasses the most important 129 interval identified by the linkage studies in the ( C57BL/6  129/Sv ) F2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Female Chromosome 1 congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( C57BL/6 .129 [ D1Mit105 -- 223 ] ) , together with sex-matched Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations ( C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  ) and C57BL/6 controls , were monitored for the presence of lupus .
In the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , the 129 genome around the Apcs locus was mapped as a stretch of approximately 17 cM , positioned from 87.9 cM ( D1Mit15 ) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17 ) .
Thus , the congenic line carried a similar 129 region ( 80 -- 106 cM ) to the one present in the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( 87.9 -- 105 cM ) .
At 1 y of age , all <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> were sacrificed , the auto-Abs assessed , and the renal histology examined .
The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 8 .
As previously reported ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) , the levels of auto-Abs were markedly increased in the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  compared to the wild-type C57BL/6 controls .
However , the C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> also expressed high levels of auto-Abs , and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> containing a null mutation of the Apcs gene .
These results clearly demonstrated that epistatic interactions between 129 loci on Chromosome 1 and C57BL/6 genes were sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear autoantigens .
However , in contrast to the serological data , the histological assessment of the kidneys showed evidence of markedly increased glomerulonephritis in the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  compared to both control groups ( Figure 9 ) , suggesting that the lack of Apcs , when combined with other C57BL/6 susceptibility alleles , can induce the development of severe renal damage .
There is accumulating evidence that background genes may influence the expression of autoimmunity in gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Here we report what is to our knowledge the first systematic study that has examined this in the 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strains , widely used for gene targeting .
Our results demonstrate interacting loci between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> that can cause the expression of a powerful autoimmune phenotype in these <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> , in the absence of any gene-targeted mutations .
We also developed a congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> strain bearing a portion of 129 Chromosome 1 on a C57BL/6 background and showed that this wild-type congenic line expressed striking anti-nuclear autoimmunity .
By comparing this Chromosome 1 congenic strain with matched congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> lacking the Apcs gene , we demonstrated that serum amyloid P component deficiency influences the severity of glomerulonephritis , but is not the prime mover in the induction of anti-nuclear autoimmunity , contrary to our own original interpretation of our data ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) .
The same consideration applies to other genes located in the same Chromosome 1 region that have been implicated in the development of SLE when inactivated by gene-targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed onto a pure genetic background ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Miwa et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) .
For each , there has to be a question as to whether the anti-nuclear autoimmunity is due to the gene-targeted mutant gene or to the normal 129 genes expressed in the same region as the targeted gene .
The influence of background genes on the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease is well known , especially with respect to the lpr and Yaa disease-susceptibility genes .
In MRL/Mp <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , the presence of the lpr gene accelerates the development of high level and broad-spectrum auto-Ab production and lethal glomerulonephritis , in addition to marked lymphoproliferative disease .
In contrast , homozygosity of the lpr gene in other strains such as C57BL/6 , AKR , LG/J , and C3H leads only to auto-Ab production ( Izui et al. 1984 ) .
Similarly , the Y-chromosome-linked Yaa gene in BXSB and MRL/Mp males enhances the rapid development of auto-Abs and glomerulonephritis ( Izui et al. 1988 ; Merino et al. 1989 ) .
However , in the C57BL/6 background , the Yaa gene does not lead to an autoimmune phenotype ( Izui et al. 1988 ) .
Not surprisingly , important effects of the genetic background on the expression of autoimmunity have also been reported in gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ; Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
Thus , SLE exists as a complex-trait disorder in which specific combinations of susceptibility alleles are required for the expression of the full phenotype .
Through the use of microsatellite marker maps , the identification of <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> SLE susceptibility intervals in experimental crosses has been made possible .
These mapping studies have shown that the disease expression in relation to the inheritance of the different alleles followed a threshold liability pattern in which a positive phenotype depended upon the presence of multiple discrete susceptibility loci with no single locus being a prerequisite factor .
We have employed the same approach to analyse the genetic basis of disease inheritance in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid strain , the most common genetic background in gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Although spontaneous autoimmunity has not been documented in either of the pure 129 or C57BL/6 strains , a spontaneous lupus-like phenotype has been described in ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid strains ( Obata et al. 1979 ; Botto et al. 1998 ; Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ) , suggesting that the predisposition in these hybrid <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> may arise as a result of the interaction between specific combinations of alleles inherited from both the 129 and C57BL/6 parental strains .
This was confirmed by the mapping study reported here .
We showed that there are multiple genetic loci contributing to the disease and these are derived from both 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
We demonstrated that a 129-derived segment of Chromosome 1 was strongly linked to the expression of auto-Abs .
This region is probably capable of causing the initiation of a humoral autoimmune response to nuclear antigens ; however , this response does not occur in the absence of C57BL/6 genes .
In support of this , we identified a C57BL/6 segment on Chromosome 3 , which may interact with the 129 genes on Chromosome 1 to mediate the loss of tolerance .
Interestingly , although the C57BL/6 SLE-susceptibility region on Chromosome 3 is novel , disease-modifying alleles derived from C57BL/10 and C57BL/6 strains have been mapped to a portion of Chromosome 3 close to the region identified in this study ( Morel et al. 1999 ; Haywood et al. 2000 ) .
Furthermore , the region on Chromosome 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> models of SLE ( Santiago et al. 1998 ; Morel et al. 1999 ; Xie et al. 2002 ) , suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility loci .
Taken together our results suggest a complex genetic contribution from the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid background genome , with both enhancing as well as inhibitory loci from the 129 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , in addition to genes promoting autoimmunity from the C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
The impact that these interacting loci may have on the lupus-like disease present in several gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> was further assessed by comparing Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> with Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls .
In the context of SLE susceptibility , one of the most consistently mapped non-MHC regions of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> genome is the telomeric Chromosome 1 segment , where several disease loci , designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001 ) , Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995 ; Rozzo et al. 1996 ; Vyse et al. 1997 ) , and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998 ) , have been mapped in lupus-prone strains .
Moreover , this region of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Chromosome 1 is orthologous to a region on <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> Chromosome 1q22 -- 1q25 , which has also been linked with <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> SLE ( Moser et al. 1998 ) .
The Apcs gene is one of the candidate genes known to lie within this region .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> serum amyloid P component binds avidly to DNA , chromatin , and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro ( Pepys 1974 ; Pepys and Butler 1987 ; Butler et al. 1990 ) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo ( Hintner et al. 1988 ; Breathnach et al. 1989 ; Familian et al. 2001 ) .
We have previously reported that ( 129  C57BL/6 ) .
Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) .
On the basis of these observations , it was postulated that Apcs , by altering the clearance of chromatin , contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE .
However , in this study we found that only ANA and anti-chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the loci from the parental strains .
Furthermore , the whole-genome analysis identified the 129 region surrounding the Apcs gene as the main locus contributing to the development of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab .
In agreement with this , when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and Chromosome 1 genetically matched controls , we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto-Abs .
These findings , taken together , indicated that the phenotype associated with Apcs deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 genes from the telomeric region of Chromosome 1 operating in the C57BL/6 genomic background .
Strong supportive evidence for this was provided by the analysis of the C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> congenic for this 129 region .
The generation and analysis of congenic strains have successfully been used to dissect the contribution of individual susceptibility alleles to a multigenic trait such as SLE .
We adopted the same strategy to investigate the relative contribution of the 129 Chromosome 1 segment and the Apcs gene to each disease trait .
Using this approach , we demonstrated that the 129 interval on distal Chromosome 1 , when transferred onto the C57BL/6 genome , a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 a mutated gene located in that chromosomal region , was sufficient to mediate the production of auto-Abs .
In this context , it is of note that several strains of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> with targeted mutations of genes encoded in this region have been reported to express a lupus-like illness , including <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> lacking FcRIIB ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ) , complement receptors ( CR1/2 ) ( Prodeus et al. 1998 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) , and decay-accelerating factor ( CD55 ) ( Miwa et al. 2002 ) .
In each case , the autoimmune phenotype was described in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in which the null mutation was generated in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed to the C57BL/6 or another genetic background .
Thus , in view of our findings , one may postulate that in each of these <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> models of SLE , the effects of the targeted null gene were irrelevant .
Similar conclusions may apply to other gene-targeted <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> carrying mutations of genes mapped in the 129-derived susceptibility allele on Chromosome 7 ( O'Keefe et al. 1996 , 1999 ) .
The expression of anti-nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
The only difference in phenotype between these <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> was in the expression of glomerulonephritis , which was more pronounced in the Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> compared with the congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Although these findings demonstrate that Apcs is not implicated in the processing of autoantigens , as it had previously been suggested , they indicate that Apcs might still play an important protective role in lupus nephritis .
In support of this , the expression of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> C-reactive protein , an acute-phase protein closely related to Apcs , has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB/W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex ( Szalai et al. 2003 ) .
Consistent with this , a polymorphism associated with reduced basal level of C-reactive protein has been reported to be linked to SLE in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> ( Russell et al. 2004 ) .
However , as the congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and the Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> carried similar but not identical 129 regions on Chromosome 1 , an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL/6 genes involved in self-tolerance and end organ damage .
Thus , whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility genes for the full expression of lupus , further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of Apcs in the pathogenesis of renal damage .
In summary , our findings demonstrate the impact of epistatic interactions between 129 and C57BL/6 genomes on the development of SLE and illustrate how these background gene effects may lead to incorrect interpretations when analysing the autoimmune phenotype of specific genetic disruptions .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mice </term> .
All the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were females .
Wild-type C57BL/6 and 129/Sv ( 129S6 , according to the revised nomenclature ) were bred and maintained in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> care facility at Imperial College , London , United Kingdom .
( 129  C57BL/6 ) F1 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were generated by intercrossing the two wild-type strains and ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> by interbreeding the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F1 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
The Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were generated as previously reported ( Botto et al. 1997 ) , and the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were generated by intercrossing Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> on the 129 genetic background with Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations .
A total of 141 ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 and 158 ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were produced and monitored for 1 y. Wild-type congenic C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were generated by backcrossing the 129 interval between microsatellites D1Mit105 and D1Mit223 ( 80 cM to 106 cM ) onto the C57BL/6 strain .
Inherited 129 regions were mapped with microsatellite markers polymorphic between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( see below ) .
After seven generations of backcrossing , siblings were intercrossed to generate C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) congenic <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> homozygous for the 129 Chromosome 1 interval .
Inside 129 markers at positions 81.6 cM ( D1Mit159 ) and 105 cM ( D1Mit17 ) , respectively , and an outside C57BL/6 marker at position 74.3 cM ( D1Mit159 ) were used to further define the interval .
In the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations ) , the 129 genome around the Apcs locus was mapped as a segment from 87.9 cM ( D1Mit15 ) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17 ) .
In this analysis , the inside 129 markers were at positions 93 cM ( D1Mit36 ) and 99.7 cM ( D1Mit115 ) and the outside C57BL/6 markers at positions 81.6 cM ( D1Mit159 ) and 106 cM ( D1Mit223 ) .
Along with 28 C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and 30 C57BL/6 wild-type <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> , 26 C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) female <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term>  /  were followed up to 1 y of age .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> Animals </term> were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions .
All <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines .
Serological analyses .
Sera , collected at 6 and 12 mo of age , were assayed for the presence of auto-Abs .
Levels of IgG ANA were sought by indirect immunofluorescence using Hep-2 cells , and anti-dsDNA Abs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on <termsem="NCBITaxon:46909"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Crithidia luciliae </term> </term> as previously described ( Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
Serum samples were screened at a 1:80 ( ANA ) or 1:20 ( anti-dsDNA ) dilution and the positive samples titrated to endpoint .
Abs to ssDNA and anti-chromatin were measured by ELISA , as previously described ( Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
Samples were screened at a 1:100 dilution , and the results were expressed in arbitrary ELISA units ( AEUs ) relative to a standard positive sample ( derived from an MRL/Mp .
lpr/lpr <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> ) , which was assigned a value of 100 .
For interplate comparison , serial dilutions of a positive control serum sample were included on each plate .
Apcs levels were assessed by ELISA using <termsem="NCBITaxon:9940"> sheep </term> anti- <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Apcs and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> anti- <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Apcs Abs ( Calbiochem , Nottigham , United Kingdom ) .
Samples were screened at a 1:3,000 dilution , and the results were expressed in milligrams per liters , referring to a standard curve derived from an acute-phase serum with a known concentration of Apcs ( Calbiochem ) .
Apcs  /  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> serum was included as a negative control .
Histological analysis .
All the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , except the few that died before the end of the experiment , were sacrificed at 1 y of age , and kidney portions were fixed in Bouin 's solution and paraffin embedded , and sections were stained with periodic acid -- Schiff reagent .
Glomerular histology was graded in a blinded fashion as follows : grade 0 , normal ; grade 1 , hypercellularity involving greater than 50 % of the glomerular tuft in 25 % -- 50 % of glomeruli ; grade 2 , hypercellularity involving greater than 50 % of the glomerular tuft in 50 % -- 75 % of glomeruli ; grade 3 , glomerular hypercellularity in greater than 75 % of glomeruli or crescents in greater than 25 % of glomeruli .
Non-parametric data are expressed as median with range of values in parentheses .
All statistics were calculated using GraphPad PrismTM version 3.0 for Windows ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , California , United States ) .
Non-parametric tests were applied throughout , with differences being considered significant for p values < 0.05 .
The Mann -- Whitney test was used for comparison of two groups , whilst for analysis of three groups the Kruskal -- Wallis test with Dunn 's multiple comparison test was used .
Genotyping was carried out by PCR of genomic DNA using 143 polymorphic markers ( list available on request ) distributed throughout all 19 autosomes .
PCRs were performed using standard reagents containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 M primers .
Microsatellite markers were screened for size polymorphisms between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Only primers with differences detectable on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels or on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used .
The QTL program MAPMANAGER.QTL ( ftp://mcbio.med.buffalo.edu/pub/MapMgr/ ) was used , and the two experimental groups were examined independently .
Only data from <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> at 12 mo of age were analysed .
Log transformations of auto-Abs levels resulted in more normalised distribution and were used in QTL mapping .
LOD thresholds for suggestive and significant linkages were determined by using a cohort - and trait-specific permutation test ( 1,000 permutations ) .
The average threshold for suggestive , significant , and highly significant linkages were LOD  2.1 ( p  7.8  10  3 ) , LOD  3.6 ( p  2.4  10  4 ) , and LOD  5 ( p  1  10  5 ) , respectively ( Manly and Olson 1999 ) .
