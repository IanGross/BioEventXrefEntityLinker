A Signaling Pathway Involving <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> and <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in Hair Follicle Morphogenesis .
In a common theme of organogenesis , certain cells within a multipotent epithelial sheet exchange signals with their neighbors and develop into a bud structure .
Using hair bud morphogenesis as a paradigm , we employed mutant mouse models and cultured keratinocytes to dissect the contributions of multiple extracellular cues in orchestrating adhesion dynamics and proliferation to shape the cluster of cells involved .
We found that <termsem="PR:000000183"> transforming growth factor 2 </term> signaling is necessary to transiently induce the transcription factor <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> and activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway in the bud .
In the epidermis , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> misexpression leads to hyperproliferation and a reduction in intercellular adhesion .
When <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> is transcriptionally down-regulated , associated adhesion proteins with dual functions in signaling are released from cell-cell contacts , a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras-MAPK activation .
These studies provide insights into how multipotent cells within a sheet are stimulated to undergo transcriptional changes that result in proliferation , junctional remodeling , and bud formation .
This novel signaling pathway further weaves together the web of different morphogens and downstream transcriptional events that guide hair bud formation within the developing skin .
Mammalian development involves the morphogenesis of complex three-dimensional structures from seemingly uniform sheets or masses of cells .
A simple bud-like structure initiates the formation of many organs , including lungs , spinal cord , mammary glands , and hair follicles [ 1 ] .
The multipotent , adhering epithelial cells are typically attached to an underlying basal lamina that polarizes the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme .
Budding morphogenesis is guided by a reciprocal exchange of signals between epithelium and mesenchyme to specify the identity of the organ that will form and to govern its growth .
At the helm of these molecular communication pathways are Wnts , <termsem="PR:000000034"> bone morphogenic proteins </term> ( <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMPs </term> ) , <termsem="PR:000000046"> transforming growth factor s </term> ( <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF-s </term> ) , and fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) .
Through activation of cell surface transmembrane receptors , these external signaling molecules trigger distinct cascades of intracellular events that culminate in changes in gene expression , growth , and differentiation [ 2 ] .
How this constellation of signals collaborates in tailoring each budding process so that it executes a distinct morphogenetic program has yet to be comprehensively defined .
However , the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud formation , since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to develop and cell fates are specified .
The development of a bud requires a number of coordinated changes in the behavior of the targeted cells within an epithelial sheet .
The process must be accompanied by alterations in the proliferation , polarity , shape , and adhesiveness of selected cells , as well as by modifications in their underlying basal lamina .
Thus , extracellular epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk must be intricately orchestrated to couple the determination of distinct cell fates with the contemporaneous remodeling of the physical and structural properties of the cell .
Among the few dispensable organs , hair follicles offer an excellent model system to study epithelial bud formation .
Mammalian skin epithelium begins as a single sheet of multipotent ectodermal cells .
During development , specialized mesenchymal cells populate the skin in a spatially defined pattern to initiate the complex epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk that will specify the bud [ 3 ] .
Once committed , a small cluster of epithelial cells , the placode , instructs a group of underlying mesenchymal cells to condense and form the nascent dermal papilla , which will be a permanent fixture of the hair follicle .
Subsequent exchanges between the placode and nascent dermal papilla result in further growth of the follicle into the underlying dermis , or down-growth , and eventual differentiation into the six concentric layers of the mature follicle .
Previously , we delineated how two respective epithelial and mesenchymal signals , Wnts and the <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMP </term> - inhibitory factor <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> , function in concert to induce <termsem="PR:000009751"> lymphoid enhancer factor-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> ( <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> ) - mediated gene transcription within the follicle placode [ 4 ] .
The downstream changes elicited through convergence of these two early signaling pathways include down-regulation of the gene encoding <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> , the prototypical epithelial <termsem="PR:000001327"> cadherin </term> that forms the transmembrane core of intercellular adherens junctions ( AJs ) [ 5 ] .
We subsequently showed that when <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> is transgenically elevated in mouse skin , hair follicle morphogenesis is blocked , suggesting that <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> down-regulation is a critical event in governing the adhesion dynamics necessary for budding morphogenesis [ 4 ] .
Like <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> , <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> also binds to <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> .
At sites of cell-cell contact , however , <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> - <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> complexes recruit -catenin , which in turn coordinates the associated actin polymerization dynamics necessary to stabilize nascent AJs and integrate the cytoskeleton across an epithelial sheet [ 6,7,8 ] .
-Catenin also binds to the class III Lin-1 , Isl-1 , Mec-3 ( LIM ) protein <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> ( a member of the <termsem="PR:000018242"> zyxin </term> family of proteins ) , which appears to function dually in both adhesion and in activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway [ 9,10 ] .
Through these links , AJs appear able to couple adhesion with cytoskeletal dynamics as well as with nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling .
This provides a framework for conceptualizing why <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> levels appear to impact upon a plethora of developmental processes ( reviewed in [ 11 ] ) .
As we probed more deeply into the underlying mechanisms governing <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> promoter activity , we were intrigued by the close proximity of the <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> binding site to a site known to bind the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> / <termsem="PR:000015309"> Slug </term> family of zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins [ 12,13,14,15 ] .
Both activity of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> and down-regulation of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> play pivotal roles in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( EMTs ) , typified by the transformation of polarized , adhering epithelial cells into motile mesenchymal cells [ 16,17 ] .
Bud formation differs from an EMT in that <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> activity needs to be down-regulated but not prevented , so that adhesive junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired .
Supportive of an underlying ability to fine-tune <termsem="PR:000001327"> cadherin </term> expression at the transcriptional level , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> seems to have an additive effect with <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> in negatively modulating <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> promoter activity [ 4 ] .
In the present study , we discovered that <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is expressed briefly at an early stage of hair bud formation , when <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> down-regulation and activation of proliferation take place .
Thereafter , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> disappears and remains absent during subsequent follicle down-growth and maturation .
This exquisite pattern appears to be functionally relevant since altering it in vivo correspondingly affects features associated with hair bud formation , including down-regulation of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> , increased proliferation , and repressed terminal differentiation .
Although the temporal spike of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in the hair bud is reflected at the mRNA level and seems to follow Wnt signaling and <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMP </term> inhibition , <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> activation does not appear to induce <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression in embryonic skin keratinocytes .
In contrast , we provide in vitro , transgenic ( Tg ) , and gene targeting evidence to show that <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> and <termsem="PR:000000364"> small phenotype -- and mothers against decapentaplegic -- related protein 2 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000000364"> SMAD2 </term> ) signaling are upstream inducers of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression in skin epithelium .
In the absence of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling and <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression , hair placodes can form , but further follicle down-growth is blocked .
Our studies point to the view that <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> likely functions downstream of cell fate specification , at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit enhanced proliferation and migration .
<termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA and Protein Are Expressed Transiently at the Hair Bud Stage of Follicle Morphogenesis .
Although <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members are most frequently associated with EMTs , they also participate in many malignant processes involving a down-regulation but not a quantitative abrogation of intercellular junctions [ 18 ] .
The range of developmental processes in which <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members have been implicated thus includes the type of epithelial remodeling that is observed in hair follicle bud formation .
Given our prior observation that exogenously added <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> can participate with <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> in down-regulating <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> expression in keratinocytes [ 4 ] , coupled with the established requirement for <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> in hair follicle morphogenesis [ 4,19 ] , we turned to addressing whether <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> / <termsem="PR:000015309"> Slug </term> family members might also participate in the process .
PCR analyses identified transient <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA expression during a period of skin embryogenesis when waves of hair follicles are forming ( unpublished data ) .
To pinpoint specifically where <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA is expressed in the developing skin , we conducted in situ hybridization using a cRNA probe unique to the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> 3  untranslated region ( UTR ) .
Embryonic day 17.5 ( E17 .5 ) was chosen , since the multiple waves of follicle morphogenesis occurring at this time enabled us to evaluate <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression at different stages of the process .
As shown in Figure 1A , specific hybridization was detected within the epithelium of nascent hair buds .
By contrast , as follicles progressed further through their development ( e.g. , germ and peg stages ) , they exhibited no signs of hybridization ( Figure 1A ) .
The transient nature of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA expression during follicle development was most apparent in hybridized skin sections containing follicles from two different waves of morphogenesis ( as shown in Figure 1 ) .
Hybridizing hair buds from a later wave appeared juxtaposed with nonhybridizing follicles from an earlier wave .
To determine whether this transient nature of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA expression is reflected at the protein level , we generated an antibody against the N-terminal sequence that resides upstream of the more conserved zinc finger domains .
As judged by Western blot analysis , the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes , but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently expressing a hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein ( Figure 1B ) .
The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> ( approximately 28 kDa ) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin , the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of hair follicle morphogenesis from E15 .5 to newborn when over 90 % of the hair on the mouse is formed ( Figure 1B ) .
Consistent with the Western blot data , immunohistochemical analysis did not detect <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in single-layered E13 .5 epidermis ( Figure 1C ) nor in the placode , which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate ( Figure 1D ) .
Consistent with the in situ hybridization results , anti- <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of development ( Figure 1E ) .
Taken together , the anti- <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> antibody appeared to be specific for its target protein .
It did not detect other <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members known to be expressed in keratinocytes and/or skin ( unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , the immunohistochemical data paralleled our <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in situ hybridization data revealing transient <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression at the hair bud stage ( Figure 1A ) .
As judged by immunohistochemistry , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein was localized to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( Figure 1E ) .
This feature was consistent with <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> 's known function as a transcriptional repressor [ 12,13 ] .
Additionally , anti- <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> labeling was detected in only three of the four major waves of follicle morphogenesis .
<termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> was not found in the buds of guard hairs that are the earliest of all hairs to form ( at E13 .5 ) , and which constitute less than 5 % of the mouse coat ( unpublished data ) .
As judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> , the timing of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression coincided with the stage at which the developing follicle enhanced its proliferation and down-growth ( Figure 1F ) .
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active ( phosphorylated ) form of MAPK ( pMAPK ) marked a subset of the proliferating ( <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> - positive ) cells , and pMAPK-positive cells were enriched in the hair bud ( Figure 1G ) .
The timing of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> induction and <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> and pMAPK enrichment in the hair bud appeared to follow closely the induction of <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> activity , known to initiate in the hair placode stage [ 20 ] .
However , like placodes , hair buds exhibited down-regulation in <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> expression ( Figure 1H ; see also [ 4 ] ) .
Sustained Expression of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Results in Epidermal Hyperproliferation and Differentiation Defects in Tg Mouse Skin .
The striking spike of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression coincident with hair bud formation and enhanced proliferation prompted us to examine the consequences of ectopically expressing <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> elsewhere in mouse skin epidermis .
To distinguish Tg from endogenous <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> , we used the HA-epitope , shown previously not to alter <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> 's transcriptional activity [ 12 ] .
Of 20 <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> [ HA ] Tg animals generated , three expressed the transgene and all exhibited analogous phenotypes .
Mice that integrated the transgene at the single-cell stage died at or shortly after birth .
The three surviving full-Tg founder mice harbored transgene integrations that gave stable transmission of mosaic <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression through the germline .
Progressively poor health necessitated our sacrificing most offspring from these lines within a year of birth .
As <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg animals grew , they became distinguished by their small size , short tails , and flaky skin ( Figure 2A ) .
Histological analyses of 3-d old ( P3 ) mice revealed mosaic patches marked by epidermal thickening ( Figure 2B ) .
The mosaic morphology was reflected at the level of Tg <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein , with only the hyperthickened regions expressing nuclear HA-tagged <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> ( Figure 2C ) .
These hyperthickened areas were marked by excessive proliferation , as revealed by antibodies against the proliferating nuclear antigen <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> ( Figure 2D and 2E ) .
Activated , pMAPK-positive cells were also prevalent in these areas ( Figure 2F and 2G ) , as were cells expressing keratin 6 , a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin ( Figure 2H and 2I ) .
Expression of the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> transgene did not block terminal differentiation in the hyperproliferative epidermis , but it distorted it markedly ( Figure 3A -- 3H ) .
Typical of most hyperproliferating conditions , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression led to a large expansion in layers with spinous and granular morphology .
Additionally , however , was a marked and variable expansion of <termsem="PR:000009481"> keratin 5 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000009481"> K5 </term> ) , normally restricted to the innermost basal layer ( see Figure 3 ) .
Although the failure of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - null mice to develop past gastrulation [ 21 ] precluded our ability to study the loss of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> function in skin development , a good correlation emerged between the expression of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein and the extension of <termsem="PR:000009481"> K5 </term> , <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> , and pMAPK suprabasally ( compare data in Figures 2 and 3 ) .
The changes in hyperproliferation and differentiation were not initially accompanied by gross signs of epithelial invaginations .
With age , however , epidermal folds and undulations developed in areas where <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> was expressed , and proliferative markers persisted in these regions ( Figure 3I and 3J ; anti-cyclin D staining ) .
The undulations were accompanied by partial dissolution of the underlying basement membrane ( Figure 3K and 3L ) .
Aberrant staining was also observed with antibodies against components of the hemidesmosomes , which provide strong adhesion of basal epidermal cells to the underlying basal lamina ( Figure 3M and 3N ) .
Interestingly , similar types of alterations occur in the basement membrane in the hair bud of embryonic and newborn mice when <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is normally expressed .
The fact that the basement membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis is altered only in the adult Tg animals suggests the involvement of intermediary factors not as readily available in the epidermis as they are in the follicle .
Possible Links between Epidermal Hyperproliferation and Down-regulation of AJ Proteins in <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg Mice .
Given that the <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> promoter is a direct target for <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - mediated repression in vitro [ 4,12,13 ] , and that <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> was down-regulated in <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - expressing hair buds , we examined the status of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> and other AJ proteins within regions of hyperproliferative epidermis where Tg <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> was present ( Figure 4A ) .
In these regions , immunofluorescence staining of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> and -catenin were markedly diminished .
In contrast , the intensity of antibody staining for two other AJ proteins , <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> , was still strong .
Interestingly , however , despite appreciable immunofluorescence , localization of <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> appeared to be largely cytoplasmic rather than at cell-cell borders ( Figure 4A insets ) .
Architectural differences in the epidermis made Western blot analyses somewhat difficult to gauge .
However , in regions such as ear skin , where the highest levels of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein were expressed , the effects were accentuated .
In both back skin and ear skin , overall levels of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> and -catenin were reduced , under conditions where <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> levels remained unchanged relative to controls ( Figure 4B ) .
Taken together , these data were consistent with our results obtained from immunofluorescence microscopy .
A priori , the decrease in -catenin levels could be due to either direct transcriptional repression by <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> or perturbations in AJ formation caused by the decrease in <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> gene expression .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we tested whether -catenin levels could be restored by exogenous expression of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> in <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - expressing keratinocytes .
As shown in Figure 4C , transiently transfected keratinocytes expressing HA-tagged <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> displayed a loss of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> and -catenin at cell-cell borders .
Coexpression of exogenous HA-tagged <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> not only enabled cell-cell border localization of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> protein , but also rescued the cell-cell border staining of -catenin ( Figure 4C ) .
The ability to restore -catenin expression and localization under these conditions argues against the notion that <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> transcriptionally represses -catenin .
Rather , the findings are consistent with a previous report that <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> is required for the translation of -catenin mRNA [ 22 ] .
Despite the reductions in AJ markers , Tg skin still displayed sealed membranes and intercellular junctions that were largely intact , as judged by ultrastructural analyses ( unpublished data ) .
In this respect , the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud , where the down-regulation in junction proteins is permissive for cell-cell remodeling without abrogating intercellular adhesion .
The similarities between <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state , leading us to wonder whether the down-regulation of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition .
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg epidermis ( see Figure 2G ) , we used pMAPK levels as our assay to test whether the loss of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> contributed to the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - mediated increase in proliferation .
Consistent with our in vivo observations , transfected keratinocytes expressing <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> exhibited a substantial increase in pMAPK levels relative to control cells ( Figure 4D ) .
Coexpression of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> with <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> appeared to abrogate this effect .
Together , these findings raised the possibility that an AJ-associated protein that is normally sequestered at the plasma membrane may participate in a proliferation signaling pathway when AJs are deconstructed .
Numerous studies have correlated a down-regulation of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> with a translocation of <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are regulated by the <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / T cell factor ( TCF ) family of DNA binding proteins [ 23,24,25 ] .
The presence of nuclear cyclin D in hyperproliferative <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg epidermis was particularly intriguing since prior studies have reported cyclin D gene as a direct target of TCF / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> transcription [ 26 ] .
This said , we did not detect nuclear <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> in our Tg epidermis , and mating the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg mice against the TOPGal reporter mouse [ 20 ] gave no signs of ectopic <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / Tcf / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> activity ( unpublished data ) .
We next turned to the presence of cytoplasmic <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> for a possible mechanistic link to the proliferative increase in our <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg epidermis .
In addition to its documented ability to bind -catenin [ 10 ] , <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> can also associate with <termsem="PR:000008224"> growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 </term> ( <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> ) / son of sevenless ( Sos ) , the nucleotide exchange factor for Ras , which is upstream from activation of MAPK [ 9 ] .
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin , we examined the possibility that <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> might have changed its binding partner in <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - expressing epidermis .
Interestingly , <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> was readily detected in anti- <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> immunoprecipitates of protein lysates from skins of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg mice but not from the corresponding wild-type ( WT ) animals ( Figure 4E ) .
When these experiments were repeated with -catenin-null epidermis , a similar <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> - <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> association was detected , and again , this interaction was not detected in the protein extracts from control littermate skin ( Figure 4E ) .
Together , these data demonstrate that the reduction in -catenin levels , either by <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - mediated down-regulation of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> or by -catenin conditional targeting , allows <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> to interact with <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> / Sos .
If the competition between <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> / Sos and -catenin for <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> is functionally relevant to the hyperproliferative state of a keratinocyte , then overexpression of <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> would be expected to bypass the competition and promote activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway in WT keratinocytes .
Indeed , when serum-starved keratinocytes were transiently transfected with an <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> expression vector , the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those transfected with the <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - HASnail transgene ( Figure 4F ) .
This activation was abolished when cells were treated with a small peptide inhibitor that specifically interrupts the <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> / Sos interaction ( Figure 4F ; see lanes marked `` inh '' ) [ 27 ] .
<termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> 's pre-LIM domain is the segment that associates with <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> 's Src-homology 3 domain [ 9 ] .
When this domain was overexpressed in serum-starved keratinocytes , a comparable elevation in pMAPK was observed ( Figure 4F ) .
As expected , the small peptide inhibitor that interrupts the <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> / Sos association blocked the effects .
These data suggested that by elevating cytosolic <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> levels , <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> 's pre-LIM domain may associate with <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> / Sos in a manner that stimulates its nucleotide exchange activity and leads to activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway .
Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression and proliferation may be coupled in skin epithelium , proliferative circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven .
Future studies will be needed to systematically dissect these putative intricacies at a molecular level .
Probing the Regulation of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Gene Expression Reveals an Essential Link to <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> Signaling in the Developing Hair Bud .
The temporal spike of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA expression in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor ( s ) may be regulating the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene .
A variety of extracellular signals have an impact on the cell type-specific expression of different <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members , and many of them , including Wnts , <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMPs </term> , FGFs , and <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF-s </term> , also affect hair bud development [ 2,16,28 ] .
Since <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is not expressed in cultured skin keratinocytes that secrete active <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMPs </term> and FGFs ( see Figure 1B ) , we focused our attention on Wnt and <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- </term> signaling as more likely candidates for <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> induction in this cell type .
Previously , we showed that effective transmission of a <termsem="PR:000017443"> Wnt-3a </term> signal in cultured keratinocytes can be achieved through their exposure to the <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMP </term> inhibitor <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> , which induces <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> expression [ 4 ] .
In vitro , these conditions down-regulated the <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> promoter and induced a <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> - sensitive reporter gene , TOPFLASH [ 4 ] .
In contrast , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression was not induced by these conditions ( Figure 5A ) .
Thus , despite essential roles for Wnts and <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> in hair follicle specification [ 4,29,30 ] , our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in governing <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression in keratinocytes .
<termsem="PR:000000182"> TGF-1 </term> has been shown to induce <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members in hepatocytes and heart [ 15 , 31 ] .
In keratinocytes , however , <termsem="PR:000000182"> TGF-1 </term> inhibits keratinocyte growth and seems to be involved in triggering the destructive phase of the cycling hair follicle [ 32 ] .
Of the loss-of-function mutations generated in each of the <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- </term> genes , only the <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null state blocked follicle development at the hair bud stage [ 32 ] .
Thus , we turned towards addressing whether <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> might be involved in regulating <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis .
Though there is no cell culture system available to specifically study placodal cells , these keratinocytes are their progenitors and are the closest approximation available to study the behavior of epithelial cells of the placode .
Interestingly , treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng/ml of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> caused a rapid and transient induction of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> ( Figure 5B ) .
Following this treatment , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein was detected within 30 min , peaked at 2 h , and then declined thereafter .
The induction of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> appeared to be specific for the active form of the growth factor , as pretreatment of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> for 10 min at 100 C obliterated the response [ Figure 5B , lanes marked ( -- ) ] .
By contrast , although <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- </term> receptor activation remained elevated during the duration of the experiment ( as measured by the sustained phosphorylation of the downstream effector <termsem="PR:000000364"> SMAD2 </term> ) <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression could not be maintained ( Figure 5B ) .
Thus , although <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression correlated with phosphorylated <termsem="PR:000000364"> SMAD2 </term> ( pSMAD2 ) induction , its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events .
The rapid kinetics of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression were reflected at the mRNA level , suggesting that <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling ( Figure 5C ) .
To test this possibility , we engineered a transgene driving the -galactosidase reporter under the control of approximately 2.2 kb of promoter sequence located 5  from the transcription initiation site of the mouse <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene .
At 2 d after transient transfection , keratinocytes were treated with <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> ( t = 0 ) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein induction .
The results of this experiment are presented in Figure 5D .
Within 0.5 h of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> treatment , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> promoter activity had increased 3-fold , and by 2 h , it peaked to approximately 10-fold over control levels ( Figure 5D ) .
Thereafter , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes .
The kinetics of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein induction .
Moreover , the stimulatory effects appeared to be specific to <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> , since they were abrogated either by heat inactivation of the <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> protein or by mutation of a putative <termsem="PR:000000027"> SMAD </term> binding element located about 1.8 kb 5  from the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> transcription start site ( Figure 5D ) .
Taken together , these results suggested that in keratinocytes , <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling results in a pSMAD2-dependent transient activation of the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene , and that maintenance of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein relies , in part , upon sustained promoter activity .
The brevity of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene and protein induction in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> treated cultured keratinocytes resembled the temporal appearance of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNA and protein at the initiation of hair follicle morphogenesis in embryonic mouse skin .
To test whether <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> might be required for <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> induction in hair bud formation in vivo , we first analyzed whether <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> was expressed in or around the hair bud .
Consistent with previous observations [ 33 ] , an anti- <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> antibody labeled developing hair buds ( Figure 6A ) .
This labeling appeared to be specific as judged by the lack of staining in follicle buds from mice homozygous for a <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null mutation ( Figure 6A ; [ 34 ] ) .
Moreover , the downstream effector of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling , pSMAD2 , was also expressed in WT , but not <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null , hair buds ( Figure 6B ) .
Together , these data underscore the importance of the <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> isoform despite expression of both <termsem="PR:000000182"> TGF-1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> in developing hair buds at this stage .
To further explore the possible relation between <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> and <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> , we examined the status of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null hair buds .
As judged by immunohistochemistry , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein was absent from E17 .5 skin of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( Figure 6C ) .
This effect appeared to be exerted at the transcriptional level , since <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mRNAs were also not found in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( Figure 6D ) .
Conversely , in 2-wk-old <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000000364"> Smad2 </term> Tg mice , which display elevated <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- </term> signaling in skin [ 35 ] , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein was readily detected by Western blot analyses , where it was not found in postnatal skin ( Figure 6E ) .
Taken together , these results provide compelling evidence that <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> is functionally important for inducing <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression in a pSMAD-dependent manner in developing hair buds .
Whether pMARK activity also contributes to <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> induction was not addressed in the present study [ 15 ] .
Although some hair buds still formed in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null skin , their number was reduced by approximately 50 % [ 32 ] .
Thus , although the pathway mediated by <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling impacts the earliest step of epithelial invagination , it does not appear to be essential for bud morphogenesis .
Consistent with this notion , basement membrane remodeling still took place in the <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null buds , as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against <termsem="PR:000009140"> 4 integrin </term> , an integral component of keratinocyte-mediated adhesion to its underlying basement membrane ( Figure 6F ) .
In contrast , <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling appeared to be an important factor for the early proliferation that occurs in the developing hair buds , as judged by anti- <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> and anti-pMAPK immunofluorescence ( Figure 6F and 6G ) .
If <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> stimulates <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression in developing buds , loss of this morphogen would be expected to affect the expression of genes that are typically repressed by <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> .
Since a major target for <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - mediated repression is the E-cadherin gene [ 12,13 ] , we investigated the status of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null buds .
As shown in Figure 6H , hair buds in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null skin displayed elevated immunofluorescence staining relative to their WT counterparts .
Previously we demonstrated that the concerted action of the extracellular signals Wnt and <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> are required for the generation of a <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> transcription complex to repress <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> transcription at the onset of hair fate specification .
As shown in Figure 6I and 6J , both WT and <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null buds exhibited nuclear <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> localization , signs that the Wnt - <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> signaling pathway was intact .
These data suggest that during hair follicle morphogenesis , <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> functions subsequently to Wnt / <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> - mediated determination of hair fate .
Moreover , through activation of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression , <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> appears to work in tandem with these other morphogens to down-regulate <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> levels , which contributes to the activation of proliferative circuitries .
During budding morphogenesis , intersecting signaling networks from the epithelium and mesenchyme govern transcriptional , adhesive , polarity , and motility programs in these select groups of cells .
The dynamic nuclear and cytosolic changes that take place during this time form the cornerstone for organ morphogenesis .
Two major challenges in understanding the mechanisms underlying a particular budding process are to order the temporal sequence of external cues involved and then to dissect how the cells of the developing bud translate these signals into the downstream events of cellular remodeling , proliferation , and differentiation .
Our studies here provide some insights into how these events are orchestrated during hair bud formation in developing skin .
Signaling during Early Hair Follicle Morphogenesis .
Recent studies on hair bud morphogenesis suggest that Wnt signals likely from the epithelium and <termsem="PR:000000034"> BMP </term> inhibitory signals from the underlying mesenchyme converge to produce an active transcription factor complex involving <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> , which in turn plays a key role in specifying the hair follicle fate [ 4,29,30,36,37 ] .
<termsem="PR:000014841"> Sonic hedgehog </term> ( <termsem="PR:000014841"> Shh </term> ) and <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling also play essential roles in follicle morphogenesis , but in contrast to <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> null skin , in which follicle invaginations are absent [ 30 ] , some hair buds still form in the absence of <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> , <termsem="PR:000014841"> Shh </term> , or <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> [ 32,38 ] .
These likely reflect the first wave of follicle ( i.e. , guard hair ) morphogenesis , which accounts for a small number ( fewer than 5 % ) of hairs and is under distinct regulatory control .
Guard hairs form in the absence of <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> and <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> , and we have found that they also fail to express <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> at the budding stage of development ( unpublished data ) .
How <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> is regulated in guard hairs remains to be determined .
Several candidates include other <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members such as <termsem="PR:000015309"> Slug </term> or <termsem="PR:000016846"> twist </term> , or alternatively , transcription factors involving <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and a different member of the <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / TCF / <termsem="PR:000015643"> Sry </term> - type HMG box ( commonly known as SOX ) family [ 39,40 ] .
Further investigation will be required to determine whether the signaling pathway we have elucidated here is a theme with multiple variations .
<termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF-s </term> are known to promote withdrawal of keratinocytes from the cell cycle [ 41 ] .
Hence , when <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> protein was detected at the transition between the growing and destructive phases of the adult hair cycle , research initially and naturally focused on a role for this family member in cessation of growth and/or triggering apoptosis ( [ 42 ] and references therein ) .
However , in contrast to <termsem="PR:000000182"> TGF-1 </term> - null skin , which exhibits an extended growing phase of postnatal hair follicles , <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null skin displays an embryonic block in follicle bud progression [ 32 ] .
Although this phenotype is consistent with <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> 's embryonic expression patterns [ 33 ] , about 50 % of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> null buds appear unable to progress to the down-growth phase , a feature that can not be explained readily on the basis of previously established effects of <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF-s </term> .
Our finding that <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> is upstream from <termsem="PR:000010425"> Ki67 </term> expression and MAPK activation lends further support to the notion that hair follicle keratinocytes at this early stage of development react to <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling in a fashion opposite to that typically expected for <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- factors </term> .
This said , based upon pSMAD2 immunohistochemistry , the immediate steps of downstream signaling appeared to be intact .
Thus , we surmise that the proliferative outcome is likely to be rooted in differences in the repertoire of activated <termsem="PR:000000027"> SMAD </term> target genes .
In this regard , the positive effects of <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> on proliferation within the hair bud may be more analogous to what has been seen in progression of squamous cell carcinoma to metastatic carcinoma [ 43 ] rather than that typically observed for keratinocytes [ 44,45,46 ] .
The prior identification of the <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene as a potential target of <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- </term> signaling [ 15 ] was intriguing , given the temporal wave of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> gene expression that occurs in the developing hair bud .
The additional correlation between epithelial hyperproliferation and <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> transgene expression further fostered our interest in a possible link between <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> and <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> .
Our functional studies demonstrate that without <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression is abolished in the mutant hair buds , and conversely , in <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000000364"> Smad2 </term> skin , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is ectopically activated .
Moreover , our in vitro studies indicate that even sustained <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> exposure may cause only a transient induction of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> , offering a possible explanation as to why <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is so briefly expressed during hair follicle morphogenesis .
An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged expression of Tg <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions ( unpublished data ) , underscoring why transient <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression may be so important during normal hair follicle morphogenesis [ 18 ] .
At first glance , the sparsity in hair coat of <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg mice seemed indicative of a defect in follicle formation ( see Figure 2A ) .
Closer inspection , however , revealed that not all hairs penetrated the hyperthickened Tg epidermis .
Several factors may contribute to the seemingly normal follicle development in these mice .
One obvious factor is the <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> promoter , which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS ) of the hair follicle , but is markedly down-regulated in developing embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells .
The <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent response of the ORS to ectopic <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> .
Additional contributing factors could be the multiplicity of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members and their differential expression , the saturation , and/or diversity of regulatory mechanisms that govern AJ formation , migration , and proliferation in the follicle ORS .
Distinguishing between these possibilities must await the generation of mice harboring skin-specific loss-of-function <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mutations .
Links between Signaling , Transcriptional Cascades , Epithelial Remodeling , and Proliferation in the Hair Bud .
Previously , we discovered that early during hair follicle morphogenesis , <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> gene expression is down-regulated concomitantly with the invagination of developing bud cells into the skin [ 4 ] .
Because the timing of this event correlated with the activation of a <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> transcription factor complex [ 20 ] , we were intrigued by the presence of a putative <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / TCF binding site in the <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> promoter .
This prompted an investigation that subsequently led to our discovery that <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> can contribute to repression of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> gene expression in skin keratinocytes [ 4 ] .
In the course of these studies , we also noted that <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro , and our present studies revealed that <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is expressed at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process .
In <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> - null embryonic skin , <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> expression and subsequent activation of the <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> reporter gene is abrogated in the developing placodes .
The corresponding failure of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> down-regulation underscores the importance of Wnt / <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> signaling in regulating this event in follicle morphogenesis [ 4 ] .
Conditional gene targeting studies will be necessary to establish whether <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> family members also contribute to the down-regulation in <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> gene expression that occurs during follicle formation .
However , it is intriguing that <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg epidermis displayed a marked down-regulation in <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> expression , thereby demonstrating its potential to do so in skin .
Our prior findings showed that by elevating <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> levels or by conditionally ablating -catenin , hair follicle morphogenesis can be impaired [ 4,7 ] .
The marked epidermal hyperproliferation seen in the <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> Tg skin , coupled with the converse suppression of proliferation and <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> - null hair buds led us to wonder whether the down-regulation of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> during follicle morphogenesis might have a direct impact on elevating the proliferative state of these cells .
Our Tg studies suggested that , at least in part through its regulation of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> is able to influence the subcellular localization of a variety of AJ-associated proteins .
One of these appears to be <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> , which was previously shown to have the dual capacity to bind <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> as well as -catenin [ 9,10 ] .
Our studies revealed that in skin keratinocytes that either harbor a conditional null mutation in -catenin or that overexpress <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> , <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> develops an interaction with <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> that is otherwise not observed in WT keratinocytes .
The corresponding abilities of either <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - transfected or <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> - transfected keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway suggest that the <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> association of <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation .
In stable epithelial ( i.e. , Madin-Darby canine kidney , or MDCK ) cell lines , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> has been shown to block cell cycle progression and promote motility and shape changes for invasion [ 47 ] .
While our in vivo studies are consistent with a role for <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in motility and epithelial remodeling , they differ with respect to <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> 's apparent proliferative effects .
A priori , this could be simply due to variations in the response of different cell types to <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> expression .
Alternatively , these differences may be relevant to the benefit of using mouse models to reveal functions not always recapitulated in stable cell line models .
Future studies should highlight the underlying reasons for these opposing results .
Irrespective of these differences , our in vivo studies do not stand alone , as there are many situations in which a down-regulation in AJ proteins correlate with enhanced proliferation .
In fact , a myriad of diverse mechanisms have been implicated in activating epithelial proliferation upon down-regulation of AJ proteins [ 7,23,24,48 ] .
Sifting through these converging pathways is likely to be a difficult and painstaking process .
This said , by identifying the status of different players involved in specific cell types and at specific stages in development , our mechanistic understanding of how intercellular remodeling is linked to proliferation in epithelial morphogenesis should begin to surface in the future .
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which these networks converge is also a prerequisite for understanding how these processes go awry during tumorigenesis .

( B ) Expression of <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein coincides with hair development .
Protein extracts were prepared from keratinocytes transfected with empty expression vector ( <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> ) , containing the <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> promoter or with the vector driving HA-tagged <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> ( <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> ) ; or from whole skin from E13 .5 to P5 animals , including newborn ( nb ) .

Insets denote magnified tail segments , which displayed a mosaic , flaky appearance in Tg mice .
Size differences appeared with age , and are likely due to <termsem="PR:000009454"> K14 </term> - promoter activity in the tongue and oral epithelium , resulting in progressive defects and reduced food intake .
Hence , skin sections from young ( P3 ) mice were analyzed ( B -- I ) .

( I -- N ) Immunohistochemistry ( I and J ) or immunofluorescence ( K -- N ) of sections of P30 Wt ( I , K , and M ) and Tg ( J , L , and N ) ( affected areas ) skins using the antibodies indicated .
Note that with age , affected areas of the Tg epidermis became increasingly undulating , often exhibiting papilloma-like invaginations ( J ) .
Insets in I and J are magnified views of the boxed areas , illustrating the absence ( Wt ) or presence ( Tg ) of nuclear anti-cyclin D staining .
With age , affected areas of the Tg epidermis also displayed perturbations within the basement membrane , as judged by antibody labeling against either basement membrane ( K and L ) or hemidesmosomal ( M and N ) components .

( A ) Immunofluorescence of skin sections from P30 Wt and Tg mice .
Shown are affected areas of Tg skin ; in areas where <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> protein was not expressed , stainings were normal .
Antibodies used are against AJ proteins and include <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> ( <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cad </term> ) , the transmembrane core protein ; <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> ( <termsem="PR:000002198"> -cat </term> ) , which binds <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> at AJs and which can also participate as a transcription cofactor when associated with <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / TCF proteins in the nucleus ; -catenin ( -cat ) which binds to both <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> , a close relative of <termsem="PR:000018242"> zyxin </term> ; and <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> , which can associate with proteins that bind to the actin cytoskeleton , as well as with <termsem="PR:000008224"> Grb-2 </term> , a mediator of the GTP nucleotide-exchange protein Sos , involved in activation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade .
In <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> - expressing Tg regions , there was a reduced staining with anti- <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cad </term> and anti--cat and a more diffuse staining with anti- <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> .
Insets in the panels for <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> and <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> staining are magnified views of the boxed areas .
Arrows mark membrane localization of the protein and asterisks mark cells with elevated levels of cytoplasmic <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> or <termsem="PR:000009231"> Ajuba </term> .
( B ) Western blot analyses of protein extracts from P30 Wt and Tg back and ear skins .

Note that the reductions seen in <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> and -catenin are likely to be underestimates of the actual differences in affected regions , since the Tg skin expressed <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> mosaically .
( C ) In the presence of elevated <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> , -catenin levels can be restored by overexpression of <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> .

( A ) Failure of Wnt and <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> signaling to induce <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> in cultured keratinocytes .
Primary mouse keratinocytes were treated with Wnt - and/or <termsem="PR:000000021"> noggin </term> - conditioned medium ( + ) or the corresponding control medium ( -- ) .
These conditions are known to activate the <termsem="PR:000009751"> LEF-1 </term> / <termsem="PR:000002198"> -catenin </term> reporter TOPGal and down-regulate the <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> promoter ( see [ 4 ] for details ) .

Keratinocytes were transfected with a -galactosidase reporter driven by a <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> promoter that is either WT ( wt prom ) or harbors a mutation in a putative pSMAD2/pSMAD4 binding site ( mt prom ) .
At 2 d posttransfection , cells were treated with either <termsem="PR:000000046"> TGF- </term> or heat-inactivated <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> ( inact ) for the times indicated .
-galactosidase assays were then conducted , and results are reported as fold increase over a basal level of activity of 1 .
The experiment was repeated three times in triplicate , and error bars reflect variations in the results .

Our results are particularly interesting in light of the recent implication that <termsem="PR:000008288"> GSK-3 </term> controls <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> 's stability and subcellular localization [ 50 ] .
Since Wnts are known to deactivate <termsem="PR:000008288"> GSK-3 </term> , Wnt and <termsem="PR:000000183"> TGF-2 </term> signaling may contribute to <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> 's transient induction and accumulation .
Moreover , since inhibition of <termsem="PR:000008288"> GSK-3 </term> results in <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> upregulation and <termsem="PR:000001447"> E-cadherin </term> downregulation , <termsem="PR:000015308"> Snail </term> and <termsem="PR:000008288"> GSK-3 </term> may function at a crossroads in controlling hair bud development .
