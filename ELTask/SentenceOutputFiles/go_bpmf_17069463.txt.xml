The <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> protein 2 ( RanBP2 ) is a large multimodular and pleiotropic protein .
Several molecular partners with distinct functions interacting specifically with selective modules of RanBP2 have been identified .
Yet , the significance of these interactions with RanBP2 and the genetic and physiological role ( s ) of RanBP2 in a whole-animal model remain elusive .
Here , we report the identification of two novel partners of RanBP2 and a novel physiological role of RanBP2 in a mouse model .
RanBP2 associates in vitro and in vivo and colocalizes with the mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0016530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metallochaperone </term> </term> , Cox11 , and the pacemaker of <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolysis </term> , <termsem="GO:0004396"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hexokinase </term> </term> type I ( HKI ) via its leucine-rich domain .
The leucine-rich domain of RanBP2 also exhibits strong chaperone activity toward intermediate and mature <termsem="GO:0006457"> folding </term> species of Cox11 supporting a chaperone role of RanBP2 in the cytosol during Cox11 <termsem="GO:0009058"> biogenesis </term> .
Cox11 partially colocalizes with HKI , thus supporting additional and distinct roles in <termsem="GO:0009987"> cell function </term> .
Cox11 is a strong inhibitor of HKI , and RanBP2 <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppresses </term> the inhibitory activity of Cox11 over HKI .
To probe the physiological role of RanBP2 and its role in HKI function , a mouse model harboring a genetically disrupted RanBP2 locus was <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> .
RanBP2  /  are embryonically <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> , and haploinsufficiency of RanBP2 in an inbred strain causes a pronounced decrease of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system .
Inbred RanBP2 + /  mice also exhibit deficits in <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> rates and <termsem="GO:0006007"> glucose catabolism </term> without impairment of <termsem="GO:0046323"> glucose uptake </term> and <termsem="GO:0006094"> gluconeogenesis </term> .
These phenotypes are accompanied by a decrease in the electrophysiological <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> of <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> and postreceptoral neurons .
Hence , RanBP2 and its partners emerge as critical modulators of neuronal HKI , <termsem="GO:0006007"> glucose catabolism </term> , energy <termsem="GO:0042592"> homeostasis </term> , and targets for <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic </term> , <termsem="GO:0007568"> aging </term> disorders and allied neuropathies .
The <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> protein 2 ( RanBP2 ) is a large protein with several domains .
Although several protein partners were found to interact with selective domains of RanBP2 , none to this date were found toward its large leucine-rich domain ( LD ) .
Cell-based experiments support several roles of RanBP2 in <termsem="GO:0009987"> cell function </term> , such as the production of functional proteins , <termsem="GO:0051223"> control of <termsem="GO:0015031"> protein trafficking </term> </term> between the nuclear and cytosol compartments , and <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of multiple facets underlying <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> .
Still , the genetic and physiological implications of the interactions between RanBP2 and its partners and of the function of RanBP2 in a whole-animal model remain elusive .
The authors report the identification of two novel mitochondrial partners of the LD of RanBP2 , Cox11 and <termsem="GO:0004396"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hexokinase </term> </term> type I ( HKI ) ; and with multidisciplinary approaches probe the role of RanBP2 and its LD on Cox11 , HKI , and functions allied to these .
The authors found that RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity toward HKI and Cox11 .
RanBP2 and Cox11 profoundly <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulate </term> HKI activity .
Moreover , partial loss-of-function of RanBP2 in a mouse model induces deficits in <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> rates and <termsem="GO:0006007"> breakdown of glucose </term> , <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of HKI and ATP levels selectively in the central nervous system , and impairs <termsem="GO:0007601"> visual function </term> .
These findings support a critical role of RanBP2 and its partners in <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic processes </term> and allied disease states .
The RanBP2/Nup358 is a unique vertebrate and large <termsem="GO:0032947"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> scaffold </term> </term> protein comprised of multiple structural and functional domains [ 1 -- 4 ] .
Several roles of RanBP2 have emerged that implicate RanBP2 in <termsem="GO:0006913"> nucleocytoplasmic trafficking </term> [ 3,5 ] , <termsem="GO:0006412"> protein biogenesis </term> [ 6,7 ] , the <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> of the <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> spindle , <termsem="GO:0022607"> assembly </term> of the nuclear envelope [ 8 ] , and the integration of the <termsem="GO:0051081"> nuclear envelope breakdown </term> with <termsem="GO:0051382"> kinetochore formation </term> and maturation during early <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> progression [ 9 ] .
The specific interaction of RanBP2 with a diverse set of partners likely reflects a pleiotropic role of RanBP2 in <termsem="GO:0009987"> cell function </term> , possibly through the integration of multiple pathways .
On the other hand , the cell ( tissue ) - selective interaction of RanBP2 with some of its partners may also impart cell-restricted roles to RanBP2 .
For example , the <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> domains RBDn = 1-4 of RanBP2 associate with the <termsem="GO:0051170"> nuclear import </term> <termsem="GO:0015026"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> co-receptor </term> </term> , importin- [ 10,11 ] , and antibodies against RanBP2 inhibit the <termsem="GO:0051170"> nuclear import pathway </term> in HeLa cells [ 3 ] ; but such a role seems dispensable in Xenopus oocytes [ 12 ] .
In addition , the combination of the C-terminal domains , RBD4 and CY ( of RanBP2 ) , associates with a subset of <termsem="GO:0004930"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> G protein-coupled receptors </term> </term> , the red/green opsin , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons and <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhances </term> opsin functional <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> [ 6,7 ] , while the interaction of the KBD of RanBP2 with a subset of the conventional <termsem="GO:0003777"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> microtubule-based motor </term> </term> proteins , the kinesins , KIF5B and KIF5C , occurs selectively in the central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 13 ] .
A diverse set of additional molecular partners , each associating specifically with a selective domain of RanBP2 , are likely to impart and integrate additional roles to RanBP2 .
For example , the cyclophilin-like domain ( CLD ) , the internal repeat ( W1W2/IR ) , and zinc-finger rich ( ZnF ) domains of RanBP2 associate specifically with components of the 19S cap of the proteasome [ 14 ] , the E2 SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme ( Ubc9 ) [ 15 ] , and the <termsem="GO:0005049"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0051168"> nuclear export </term> receptor </term> </term> , CRM1/exportin -1 [ 16 ] , respectively .
RanBP2 itself was also found to exhibit SUMO1 E3 <termsem="GO:0016874"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ligase </term> </term> activity [ 17 ] , supporting a direct link between RanBP2-mediated SUMO-1 substrate modification and <termsem="GO:0006810"> relocation </term> of SUMO-1 modified cytosolic substrates ( e.g. , RanGAP ) to the cytosolic face of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) [ 18 ] .
Finally , RanBP2 was also found to <termsem="GO:0051179"> localize </term> prominently to the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid subcellular compartment of <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons [ 19 ] and to RanGTPase-restricted foci along cytoplasmic tracks [ 19 ] , in addition to its <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> at cytoplasmic fibrils emanating from nuclear pores [ 2,3,10,12,19 ] .
Emerging evidence supports that the CNS-selective effects of RanBP2 may also underlie the pathogenesis of certain neuropathies .
Parkin is ubiquitously <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> and interacts with the Ubc9-interacting domain of RanBP2 [ 20 ] .
This <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> the <termsem="GO:0016567"> ubiquitination </term> and <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> of RanBP2 [ 20 ] , possibly via the interaction of the CLD domain of RanBP2 with the 19S cap subunits of the proteasome [ 14 ] .
Interestingly , the small yeast <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> protein 1 ( RanBP1 ) , Yrb1p , with strong homology to the <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> domains of RanBP2 , is also required for <termsem="GO:0051726"> <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell-cycle </term> regulated </term> <termsem="GO:0030163"> protein degradation </term> [ 21 ] .
Parkin , like RanBP2 [ 17 ] , has E3 - <termsem="GO:0016874"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ligase </term> </term> activity [ 22 -- 24 ] ; and loss-of-function of parkin leads to early onset autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism [ 25 ] .
While the dopaminergic neuronal-restricted effects of mutations in parkin are not understood [ 25 ] , parkin  /  mice exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and energy and <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> deficits , and a fraction of parkin <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> to the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondria , where together with other partners is thought to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> the <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> of selective mitochondrial substrates and to exert a <termsem="GO:0043526"> neuroprotective function </term> [ 26 -- 29 ] .
These data suggest that deficits in RanBP2 and parkin may share ( patho ) <termsem="GO:0008150"> physiological pathways </term> and support a multifaceted role of RanBP2 .
Yet clear functions of RanBP2 in animal and cell physiology remain elusive .
Here , we report on the identification and function of two novel partners of RanBP2 , Cox11 and <termsem="GO:0004396"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hexokinase </term> </term> type I ( HKI ) , which interact with a large and orphan domain of RanBP2 , the leucine-rich domain ( LD ) ; and on the outcome of partial loss-of-function of RanBP2 on HKI , animal physiology , and glucose/energy metabolism .
The LD of RanBP2 Interacts with Cox11 and HKI .
The LD of RanBP2 ( Figure 1A ) is a large and orphan domain of ~ 700 residues ( ~ 80 kDa ) , for which no molecular partners have been identified until this date .
Brain and retina yeast two-hybrid libraries were screened with LD .
Cox11 was identified as a partner to this domain ( Figure 1B and 1C ) .
Cox11 is a <termsem="GO:0016530"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metallochaperone </term> </term> implicated in <termsem="GO:0008535"> <termsem="GO:0004129"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytochrome c oxidase </term> </term> assembly </term> [ 30,31 ] .
Structure-function analysis of the interaction between mCox11 , LD of RanBP2 , and subdomains thereof , with quantitative yeast two-hybrid assays [ 32 ] , showed optimal interaction between the intact LD and Cox11 proteins ( Figure 1C ) .
Pull-down assays of retinal extracts with <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutathione S-transferase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> ) - LD precipitates a sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant dimer isoform of Cox11 ( Figure 1D , top panel ) , which does not <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GST </term> </term> - LDZIP alone .
In addition to Cox11 , we also found that other mitochondrial components such as the outer membrane-associated protein , HKI [ 33 ] ( Figure 1D , bottom panel ) and mHsp70 ( unpublished data ) , associated with LD of RanBP2 .
This association was highly specific toward the HKI isoform , because HKII , HKIII , and <termsem="GO:0004340"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glucokinase </term> </term> did not interact with the LD of RanBP2 ( unpublished data ) .
The interaction of Cox11 , HKI , and mHsp70 with RanBP2 occurred in vivo in retinal extracts , since antibodies against these and RanBP2 coimmunoprecipitated RanBP2 ( Figure 1E ) and HKI ( Figure 1F ) , respectively , and these interactions were observed across different tissues ( Figure S1 ) .
Since RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity , we assessed whether the interaction between the LD of RanBP2 and Cox11 was direct and the chaperone activity of LD toward <termsem="GO:0006457"> folding </term> species of Cox11 .
Reconstitution <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> assays were carried out between purified LD and Cox11 , fully and partially <termsem="GO:0030164"> denatured </term> with GnHCl and urea , respectively , and native Cox11 ( Figure 1G and 1H ) .
Partial <termsem="GO:0030164"> denatured </term> Cox11 exhibits significantly higher and concentration-dependent <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> affinity toward LD compared with the native and fully <termsem="GO:0030164"> denatured </term> Cox11 ( Figure 1G ) .
In addition , native Cox11 purified upon <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the presence of CuSO4 ( a prosthetic group tightly <termsem="GO:0005488"> bound </term> to Cox11 ) [ 31 ] , shows significantly higher <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> activity toward the LD of RanBP2 , than in the absence of CuSO4 ( Figure 1H ) .

( C ) Structure-function analysis of the interaction between the LD of RanBP2 and Cox11 .
Optimal interaction between the LD and Cox11 occurred in the presence of constructs comprising both the complete LD and Cox11 .
Although removal of the cytosolic N-terminal ( Cox11-C ) significantly decreased the interaction with LD , the mitochondrial intermembrane domain of Cox11 ( Cox11-C ) together with the C-terminal half of LD ( LD-C ) retained most of the interaction activity .
LD-N and LD-C ended and began with the leucine zipper domain of RanBP2 .

Cox 11 Inhibits HKI Activity and the LD of RanBP2 Reverses the Inhibition of Cox11 over HKI .
To probe whether the interaction of Cox11 and HKI with the LD of RanBP2 <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulates </term> the enzymatic activity of HKI , we first examined the effect of increasing concentrations of Cox11 on the initial rates of HKI enzymatic activity ( Figure 2A ) .
Cox11 strongly inhibits HKI activity in a concentration-dependent fashion , and at ~ 15 nM of Cox11 , HKI activity could not be recorded ( Figure 2A ) .
Cox11 behaves as a partial noncompetitive inhibitor of HKI by affecting the Vmax of HKI for glucose ( Figure 2B ) .
Then , we evaluated the effect of the LD of RanBP2 on the <termsem="GO:0004396"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> HK </term> </term> activity in the presence of a fixed inhibitory concentration of Cox11 , saturating concentration of glucose substrate , and increasing concentrations of LD .
As shown in Figure 2C , the LD domain sharply reversed the inhibitory effect of Cox11 on HKI activity in a concentration-dependent manner , but under saturating ( and stochiometric ) amounts of LD , the velocity of the reaction did not reach that observed for HKI activity in the absence of Cox11 ( Figure 2A ) , suggesting the LD by itself may also have an effect on HKI activity .
Indeed , a saturating concentration of LD reduced the Vmax but not the Km of HKI ( Figure 2D ) by ~ 20 % under similar conditions .

Cox11 behaves as a noncompetitive inhibitor of HKI by reducing the Vmax of HKI but not its Km toward glucose .
( C ) HKI rate is plotted as a function of LD concentration at saturating glucose and fixed Cox11 ( 7.5 nM ) concentrations .
Note that increasing concentrations of the LD of RanBP2 reverse the inhibition of HKI activity by Cox11 .
A half-maximal effect of the LD of RanBP2 on HKI activity in the presence of 7.5 nM of Cox11 was observed at a concentration of ~ 0.05 nM of LD .
( D ) Rate versus glucose plot in the absence and presence of the LD of RanBP2 .
At a saturating concentration of the LD of RanBP2 ( 3.75 nM ) , the HKI activity was reduced by about 20 % .

RanBP2 Colocalizes with HK1 , Cox11 , and mHsp70 in the Retina and Cultured Neurons .
In addition to its presence at the vicinity of NPCs , we have shown previously that RanBP2 is <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to and abundant in the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid subcellular compartment of <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> ( photoreceptor ) neurons of the retina [ 19 ] .
We extended the subcellular colocalization studies on RanBP2 and its novel partners by immunocytochemistry to determine if RanBP2 , Cox11 , HKI , and mHsp70 colocalize in hippocampal neurons ( Figure 3A -- 3C ) , cerebral cortex neurons ( Figure 3D -- 3F ) , ellipsoid ( mitochondria-rich ) subcellular compartments of <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons of the retina ( Figure 3G -- 3O ) , and dissociated primary glia and neuron cultures from the brain ( Figure 3P -- 3Z ) .
Double immunostaining with antibodies against these proteins showed that they colocalize to the mitochondria ( Figure 3A -- 3Z ) .
<termsem="GO:0051179"> Localization </term> of RanBP2 and Its LD Molecular Partners .
( A -- F ) are thin cryosections of an area of the hipocampus ( CA1 neurons ) and cerebral cortex , respectively , immunostained against HKI ( A and D ) , RanBP2 ( B and E ) , and merged images thereof ( C and F ) .
Note that while RanBP2 and HKI are widely <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> among and colocalize to hippocampal neurons ( C ) , HKI <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> with RanBP2 is restricted to a subset of cortical neurons ( likely interneurons ) ( F ) .
Images of the distal region of bovine retinal cryosections comprising part of the nuclear layer of photoreceptor neurons and their inner ( myoid and ellipsoid ) segment compartment ( G -- O ) are immunostained against mHsp70 ( G ) and RanBP2 ( H ) , mHsp70 ( J ) and Cox11 ( K ) , HKI ( M ) and Cox11 ( N ) , and merged images thereof ( I -- O ) .
Note the prominent <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of RanBP2 , mHsp70 , and Cox11 at the mitochondria-rich ellipsoid compartment of photoreceptors and the colocalization of RanBP2 and Cox11 with mHsp70 ( I and L ) , while HKI colocalization with Cox11 was limited to restricted foci ( R , arrowheads ) .
High-resolution images of dissociated primary cerebral neurons and glial cells confirmed that the colocalization of HKI and Cox11 was highly restricted ( P -- R ) , while RanBP2 extensively colocalized with HKI ( S -- U ) and mHsp70 ( V -- Z ) .
Scale bars in A -- O and P -- Z are 40 and 10 m , respectively .

Haploinsufficiency of RanBP2 Causes Decreased Levels of HKI and Partial Mislocalization of HKI .
To determine the physiological implications of the interaction between RanBP2 and HKI ( and other partners ) , we employed a murine embryonic stem 129Ola cell line with a targeted RanBP2 locus <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> by gene-trapping to <termsem="GO:0000003"> produce </term> stable inbred ( coisogenic ) and mixed background lines , respectively ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Genotyping of 299 F2 offspring revealed a RanBP2 + / + : RanBP2 + /  : RanBP2  /  distribution ( 89:210:0 ) that deviated from the expected Mendelian ratio and supports that the RanBP2  /  mice were embryonically <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> .
E12 .5 embryos show strong <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of RanBP2 in the optic vesicle and throughout much of the embryo , which had no apparent <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities ( Figure 4C ) .
In agreement with previous immunocytochemistry analysis [ 19 ] , the RanBP2 gene is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> across mature retinal neurons , but <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in ganglion cells of the adult retina was extremely strong ( Figure 4D and 4E ) .

In light of the association in vivo of RanBP2 with Cox11 and HKI ( Figures 1 and 3 ) , profound in vitro <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulation </term> of HKI enzymatic activity by RanBP2 and Cox11 ( Figure 2 ) , and the critical role of HKI in catalyzing a rate-limiting step of <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolysis </term> , we probed whether RanBP2 + /  mice presented disturbances in HKI , Cox11 , and energy <termsem="GO:0042592"> homeostasis </term> .
Monoallelic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of RanBP2 does not affect the number of NPCs and their <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> in hippocampal neurons ( Figure 5A , unpublished data ) , but it led to consistent lower <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of RanBP2 by more than 50 % in the CNS ( brain and retina ) in 129Ola ( Figure 5B -- 5D ) , but not in C57BL/6J/129Ola backgrounds ( unpublished data ) .
Hence , we focused our analysis on the inbred RanBP2 + /  129Ola mouse line .
Although the levels of RanBP2 were decreased in the retina , brain , and hippocampus of RanBP2 + /  mice by ~ 50 % -- 60 % ( Figure 5B and 5C ) , the levels of others nucleoporins , Nup153 and Nup62 , and mHsp70 and Cox11 , remained unchanged ( Figure 5B , unpublished data ) .
In addition , we observed a strong decrease of the levels of HKI ( 3 - to 4-fold ) ( Figure 5B and 5C ) .
This decrease was selective to the CNS , since HKI levels remained largely unaffected in the skeletal muscle , spleen , and liver ( Figure 5D ) .
Because HKI plays a key role in the <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> of energy intermediate substrates and HKI is virtually the sole <termsem="GO:0004396"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> HK </term> </term> isoform <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the CNS [ 33,34 ] , we probed the impact of HKI and RanBP2 reduction in the levels of ATP .
As shown in Figure 5E , there was significant and concordant reduction in levels of ATP in the CNS ( brain and retina ) , but not in non-neuronal tissues .
Finally , we also observed partial and selective delocalization of HKI , but not of Cox11 , from the ellipsoid ( mitochondria-rich ) to the adjacent myoid subcellular compartment of rod <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons ( Figure S2A -- S2E ) .
This was also accompanied by reduced HKI levels in the inner retina , in particular in the inner plexiform ( synaptic ) layer ( Figure S2A -- S2E ) .

No difference in the density of NPCs ( 3 -- 4 NPC/m2 ) at the nuclear envelope was found between RanBP2 + / + and RanBP2 + /  mice .

<termsem="GO:0008152"> Metabolic </term> Disturbances Caused by Haploinsufficiency of RanBP2 .
The <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> rates of inbred RanBP2 + /  mice on high-fat ( ~ 10 % fat ) diet were significantly slower than RanBP2 + / + mice ( Figure 6A ) .
Beginning at around 4 mo of age , RanBP2 + /  mice exhibit a significant slower gain in body mass than wild-type mice ( Figure 6A ) .
In addition , RanBP2 + /  inbred mice presented deficits in body mass that were erased by changing the genetic background to a mixed C57BL/6J/129Ola ( Figure 6B ) .
<termsem="GO:0007631"> Food consumption </term> did not account for the body weight differences observed ( Figure 6C ) .
RanBP2 + /  Mice on High-Fat Diet Exhibit Deficits in <termsem="GO:0040007"> Growth </term> .
( A ) In comparison to wild-type mice , RanBP2 + /  mice show slower <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> rates beginning at 4 mo of age ( arrow ) , and the difference in body weight between these is maintained afterward .
Note that RanBP2 + /  mice lack the <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> spur observed in wild-type mice between 3 and 4 mo of age .
( B ) In comparison to inbred RanBP2 + /  mice ( 129Ola genetic background ) , the difference in body weight between RanBP2 + / + and RanBP2 + /  mice is masked upon placing these on a mixed 129Ola/C57Bl6 genetic background .
( C ) RanBP2 + / + and RanBP2 + /  inbred mice exhibit similar rates of <termsem="GO:0007631"> food consumption </term> .
Mice in ( A ) , ( B ) , and ( C ) were placed on a high-fat diet since <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( n = 5 ) .
HKI in the CNS ( brain and retina ) accounts virtually for all <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of <termsem="GO:0004396"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> HK </term> </term> isozymes and glucose utilization in the CNS [ 33,34 ] .
Moreover , glucose is the sole reliance source of energy in the CNS under normal conditions , the CNS lacks glucose storage sources , and despite the disproportionate mass of the CNS to the rest of the body , the CNS consumes daily about 60 % of the body 's glucose and 25 % of the total oxygen [ 35,36 ] .
To determine the impact of RanBP2 haploinsufficiency on the utilization , formation , and <termsem="GO:0046323"> uptake of glucose </term> , we carried out several physiological assays .
In contrast to mice placed on a normal chow diet ( ~ 5 % fat ; unpublished data ) , RanBP2 + /  mice on a higher fat diet ( ~ 10 % fat ) performed significantly worse in the glucose tolerance test beginning at 6 mo of age ( Figure 7A and 7B ) , thus supporting that the RanBP2 + /  mice exhibited a deficit in glucose clearance .
This deficit was rescued in RanBP2 + /  mice of mixed C57BL/6J/129Ola background ( Figure S3 ) .
Glucose clearance was not affected due to a disturbance in insulin-mediated <termsem="GO:0046323"> glucose uptake </term> ( Figure 7C ) .
Then , we probed whether RanBP2 induces impairment of <termsem="GO:0006094"> gluconeogenesis </term> , which could contribute to the pathophysiological production and clearance of glucose .
To this end , the administration of the <termsem="GO:0006094"> gluconeogenic </term> substrate precursor , pyruvate ( pyruvate tolerance test ) , showed that there was no difference in <termsem="GO:0006094"> glucose production </term> in RanBP2 + /  mice ( Figure 7D ) .
Hence , partial loss-of-function of RanBP2 had no impact on the <termsem="GO:0006094"> gluconeogenesis pathway </term> .
However , upon <termsem="GO:0006094"> glucose production </term> ( 15 min ) , the clearance rates of glucose were again significantly slower in RanBP2 + /  than in RanBP2 + / + mice ( Figure 7D ) , confirming an impairment in <termsem="GO:0006007"> glucose breakdown </term> .
<termsem="GO:0008152"> Metabolic </term> Phenotypes of RanBP2 + /  Inbred Mice on High-Fat Diet .
( A ) 3-mo-old inbred RanBP2 + /  mice ( n = 5 ) have normal glucose clearance rates upon glucose challenge and overnight fasting .
( B ) In contrast , 6-mo-old inbred RanBP2 + /  mice ( n = 5 ) have significantly decreased glucose clearance rates upon glucose challenge and overnight fasting .
( C ) Fasted 6 - to 8-mo-old RanBP2 + / + and RanBP2 + /  mice have no difference in insulin-mediated <termsem="GO:0046323"> glucose uptake </term> as assayed by insulin tolerance test ( n = 5 ) .
( D ) Pyruvate tolerance test shows normal rise in glucose but decreased glucose clearance between inbred RanBP2 + / + and RanBP2 + /  mice ( n = 5 ) .
Haploinsufficiency of RanBP2 Causes Deficits in the Electrophysiological Output of Receptoral and Postreceptoral Retinal Neurons .
In light of the prominent <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of RanBP2 and HKI in retinal neurons [ 1,19 ] , the vital dependence of the neuronal retina ( and brain ) on glucose as the main substrate source for energy production , and the determinant impact of <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic </term> disorders , such as diabetes , in retinal function ( e.g. , diabetic retinopathy ) [ 37 ] , we probed the impact of deficits in RanBP2 , HKI , and ATP , on the electrophysiological <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> of subclasses ( rod and cone ) photoreceptor and postreceptor retinal neurons of RanBP2 + /  and in RanBP2 + / + mice .
The scotopic ( dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ) <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> mediated by the rod <termsem="GO:0007602"> photoreceptor pathway </term> at low-stimulus intensities and mixed rod and cone pathways at high-stimulus intensities were substantially reduced in RanBP2 + /  mice ( Figure 8A ) .
The differences in the photopic ( light - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ) <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> , initiated by cone photoreceptors , which make up 3 % of the <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons in the mouse retina [ 38 ] , were less obvious but still exhibited a trend toward reduced amplitudes across a range of increasing light stimulus intensities ( Figure 8B ) .
The reduction in the scotopic <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> included decreases in both b-wave ( Figure 8C ) and a-wave ( Figure 8D ) amplitudes mediated by postreceptoral and receptoral neurons , respectively .
Postreceptoral second-order neuron <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> , represented by the b-wave , tended to be more consistently and substantially reduced than the a-waves , which directly reflect photoreceptor activity .
Since second-order neuron <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> depend on input from photoreceptors , this suggests that reduced b-wave amplitudes are the result of the accumulation of decreases in the <termsem="GO:0009416"> light response </term> of both photoreceptors and postreceptoral neurons .
Anesthetics , particularly ketamine , can cause sustained elevation of glucose in mice , which in turn affects electroretinogram <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> [ 39 ] .
Thus , we were concerned that differences in electroretinogram amplitudes between RanBP2 + /  and RanBP2 + / + may reflect differences in glucose level changes in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to anesthesia .
However , we found no significant differences in glucose levels measured before and every 15 min during 75 min of anesthesia ( n = 4 -- 5 ) .
Glucose rose at the same rate and reached a maximum of approximately 3.3 times the pre-anesthesia level in both genotypes ( unpublished data ) .
Electroretinograms from 6-Mo-Old RanBP2 + /  and RanBP2 + / + Inbred Mice Showing Photoreceptor and Postreceptor Neuron Electrophysiological <termsem="GO:0050896"> Response </term> Phenotypes .
( A ) Scotopic ( dark - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> ) responses from RanBP2 + /  mice to light stimuli of increasing intensity , beginning at threshold , have reduced amplitudes compared to those observed in RanBP2 + / + mice .
The three lower intensities represent <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> generated in the rod photoreceptor neuronal pathway .
The upper intensities are comprised of <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> generated in both the rod and cone pathways .
( B ) Photopic ( light - <termsem="GO:0022401"> adapted </term> , cone photoreceptor pathway ) responses of RanBP2 + /  mice to increasing light stimulus intensities also exhibited reduced amplitudes compared to those observed in RanBP2 + / + mice .

( D ) Average  SE ( n = 5 ) scotopic a-wave amplitudes , representing photoreceptor function , for RanBP2 + /  and RanBP2 + / + mice in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to bright flashes .
Amplitudes of <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> from RanBP2 + /  mice were lower over the entire range of stimulus intensities for both b - and a-waves .
Asterisks represent significant differences between the groups ( Student 's t test , p < 0.05 ) .
Statistical significance was found across all intensities for b-wave amplitudes ( 2-way ANOVA , p < 0.0001 ) , but not for the a-wave .
Our findings support that RanBP2 plays a determinant role in <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulating </term> glucose and energy homeostasis .
The data support that Cox1 and HKI are novel partners in vivo for the large LD of RanBP2 ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
The LD of RanBP2 exhibits chaperone activity toward <termsem="GO:0006457"> folding </term> intermediates of Cox11 , and possibly , the mature HKI ( Figure 1 ) .
Cox11 inhibits noncompetitively the activity of HKI with ~ 2 -- 3 molecules of Cox11 ( assuming formation of Cox11 dimer ) required to inhibit completely the activity of a molecule of HKI ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
Cox11 <termsem="GO:0051235"> sequesters </term> HKI by <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to HKI at a site that is distinct from the active site and effectively reduces the availability of [ HKI ] tot for catalysis .
This is reflected by a reduction of the Vmax of HKI without significantly affecting the Km of the active site of HKI toward glucose ( Figure 2A and 2B ) .
The inhibitory property of Cox11 over HKI is <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppressed </term> by RanBP2 ( Figure 2C ) , which by itself has a weak but significant inhibitory activity over HKI ( Figure 2D ) .
The sub-stochiometry effect of the LD of RanBP2 over the inhibition of HKI by Cox11 supports that a LD-dependent chaperonin-like mechanism underlies the <termsem="GO:0048519"> suppression </term> of Cox11-dependent inhibition of HKI by RanBP2 , and that RanBP2 acts as a molecular `` buffer '' over HK1 and Cox11 activities .
The partial loss of the RanBP2 chaperone activity in RanBP2 + /  mice also leads to deficits in the <termsem="GO:0051235"> sequestration </term> of HKI in the ellipsoid compartment of <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons .
This possibly underlies the mistargeting of HKI to the myoid compartment of these neurons ( Figure S2 ) .
The data support that the ultimate pathophysiological outcome in HKI , caused by a reduction in RanBP2 levels and its chaperone activity , is the selective <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> of HKI as reflected by the reduced levels of HKI ( and ATP ) but not of other mitochondrial and NPC components ( Figure 5 ) .
Through this process , it is also possible that deficits in RanBP2 cause a disturbance in the equilibrium between Cox11 , HK1 , and RanBP2 by leading to an increase of the inhibitory activity of Cox11 over HKI that <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> the uncoupling of the interaction of HKI from RanBP2 , ultimately causing HKI <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> .
Regardless , lower levels of HKI likely contribute to the decreased levels in ATP , slower <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> rates , and diminished ability to <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolize </term> glucose of RanBP2 + /  mice ( Figures 5 -- 7 ) .
As discussed subsequently , the ATP deficits in the retina likely account for the reduced electrophysiological <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> of retinal neurons ( Figure 8 ) .
Various domains of RanBP2 have been previously implicated with a chaperone role in the cell .
These include the enhancement of the <termsem="GO:0009058"> biogenesis </term> of red/green opsin by the combination of the RBD4-CY domains [ 6,7 ] and the <termsem="GO:0050821"> stabilization </term> by the <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> domains of RanBP2 of the <termsem="GO:0005525"> guanosine triphosphate-bound </term> conformational state of RanGTPase and interaction of Ran with importin- [ 11,40,41 ] .
The data herein show that the multi-chaperone role of RanBP2 extends also to its LD in light of its ability to associate to distinct <termsem="GO:0006457"> folding </term> species of Cox11 and to prevent HKI from being <termsem="GO:0009056"> degraded </term> .
This chaperone function is likely to be complemented by other partners of RanBP2 with similar and pleiotropic functions .
For example , the combination of the CLD of RanBP2 with several subunits of the 19S cap of the proteasome [ 14 ] , and of its neighboring internal repeat , W1W2/IR with the E3 - <termsem="GO:0004842"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ubiquitin ligase </term> </term> , parkin [ 20 ] , and the E2 SUMO-1-conjugating protein , Ubc9 [ 15 ] may contribute to the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of HKI by 26S <termsem="GO:0043161"> proteasome-mediated proteolysis </term> and <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulation </term> of the molecular and subcellular partitioning of these partners .
In this regard , it will be interesting to probe whether parkin also causes deficits in HKI in dopaminergic neurons , since parkin was reported to <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulate </term> RanBP2 turnover [ 20 ] , and parkin loss-of-function also causes energy and <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> deficits [ 26 -- 29,42 ] .
These data add a new dimension to the complexity of the regulation of the <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolytic pathway </term> , in particular in the CNS , where <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolysis </term> plays a major role in supplying energy and where the proteasome machinery may play a critical role in <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulating </term> components of the energy supply machinery [ 43 ] .
This is further evidenced by the presence of genetic modifiers in RanBP2 + /  mice on a mixed genetic background that compensates for deficits in RanBP2 and deregulation of its partners in glucose/energy homeostasis as observed in the coisogenic line .
The presence of such compensatory mechanisms is also supported by the identification of a quantitative trait locus , which encompasses RanBP2 , and modifies the expression of diabetes-related phenotypes [ 44 ] .
The data herein show tissues with a decrease of RanBP2 and HKI levels mirror a reduction in the ATP levels .
Since the constitutive <termsem="GO:0005391"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Na + / K + ATPase pump </term> </term> and the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamine to glutamate ( both fundamental to maintain the electrical activity in the CNS ) consumes the vast majority of the energy produced by the CNS [ 45 -- 47 ] , this likely underlies the suppression of the electrophysiological output <termsem="GO:0050896"> responses </term> of retinal neurons ( Figure 8 ) .
Moreover , deficits in HKI may lead to intracellular hyperglycemia in the CNS , <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> sorbitol-induced osmotic stress , and compromise further the <termsem="GO:0005391"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ATPase-dependent Na + / K + pump </term> </term> activity [ 48 -- 50 ] .
This may be exacerbated by a decrease of ATP , since the activity of HKI is also stimulated by ATP [ 51 ] .
The cumulative effects of a reduction in ATP and intracellular hyperglycemia are known to act synergistically and <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulate </term> the electrophysiological properties of neuronal activity .
Figure 9 integrates in a model these variables and implications of the data presented herein .
Still , other bona fide RanBP2 partners previously identified and described in the Introduction also become strong candidates to play a role in energy <termsem="GO:0042592"> homeostasis </term> .
For example , the <termsem="GO:0043335"> unfolding </term> and chaperone activity of components of the 19S cap of the proteasome may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> modulated </term> by the CLD of RanBP2 [ 14 ] and contribute to the selective HKI ( and other substrates ) <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> [ 43 ] , while association of <termsem="GO:0051170"> nuclear import </term> <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> , importin- with the <termsem="GO:0008536"> Ran-binding </term> domains of RanBP2 [ 10,11 ] , may mediate the <termsem="GO:0051169"> nuclear translocation </term> of multifunctional substrates , such as <termsem="GO:0008943"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase </term> </term> .
This <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking process </term> is selectively inhibited by the <termsem="GO:0043526"> neuroprotective </term> drug , R - ( - ) - deprenyl and derivates thereof , and are often employed to treat Parkinson disease [ 52 -- 57 ] .
Hence , RanBP2 and its partners emerge as key players and target genes in mediating neuropathophysiological mechanisms implicated in various genetic and environmental lesions to the CNS , as in patients with Parkinson , diabetes with insulin-resistance , and other neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases , often linked to <termsem="GO:0007568"> aging </term> manifestations .
To this effect , the RanBP2 mouse model will serve as a unique genetic tool to probe selective , multiple and novel pathways , which may have not been anticipated to be linked to <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolic processes </term> and allied pathophysiological states .
Model Depicting a Role of RanBP2 and Some of Its Partners in Metabolic and Neuronal Function .
RanBP2 interacts with Cox11 and HKI and the triad is in equilibrium under normal physiological conditions .
RanBP2 prevents the inhibition of HKI by Cox11 and its <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> .
The ultimate effect of RanBP2 on its partners is the stimulation of the <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolytic pathway </term> and <termsem="GO:0006754"> production of ATP </term> .
The <termsem="GO:0006096"> glycolytic pathway </term> is critical to fuel the constitutive <termsem="GO:0005391"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Na + / K + - ATPase pump </term> </term> to maintain the dark current between the inner and outer segment compartments of <termsem="GO:0050953"> photosensory </term> neurons .
A deficit ( haploinsufficiency ) in RanBP2 disturbs the equilibrium between RanBP2 , HKI , and Cox11 .
This pathophysiological event <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> the <termsem="GO:0031648"> destabilization </term> and <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> of HKI and a decrease in <termsem="GO:0006754"> ATP production </term> required to maintain the <termsem="GO:0051899"> depolarization </term> state neurons , and , hence , a reduction in the <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> of receptoral and postreceptoral neurons .
A reduction in ATP levels also <termsem="GO:0048519"> negatively modulates </term> HKI activity/level .
Decreased levels of HKI <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> intracellular hyperglycemia and activate <termsem="GO:0016909"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> stress kinases </term> </term> , which <termsem="GO:0048519"> modulate negatively </term> the <termsem="GO:0005391"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Na + / K + - ATPase pump </term> </term> by <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylation </term> .
Pathophysiological pathways <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoted </term> by RanBP2 haploinsufficiency are represented by dash lines .
RIS , rod inner segment ; ROS , rod outer segment .
Finally , RanBP2 appears to join other nucleoporins , such as Nup96 [ 58 ] , in novel physiological functions that are vital for complex organisms and that were not anticipated from cell-based studies .
The reduced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of these proteins in whole-animal models generates phenotypes that are tissue-restricted and more importantly , do not seem to recapitulate phenotypes observed with knockdown experiments in cell-based culture assays .
For example , short <termsem="GO:0016246"> interfering </term> RNA-mediated knockdown of RanBP2 [ 9 ] and members of the Nup107-Nup160 complex [ 59 -- 61 ] have shown , respectively , to cause <termsem="GO:0007067"> mitotic </term> <termsem="GO:0007050"> arrest </term> and disruption of <termsem="GO:0051292"> nuclear pore assembly </term> and deficits in <termsem="GO:0006406"> mRNA export </term> in cell culture .
Yet , haploinsufficiency of RanBP2 ( this work ) and Nup96 [ 58 ] predominantly produce , instead , CNS-restricted deficits in energy <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolism </term> and alterations in the immune system linked to the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of interferon- - <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> proteins and increased susceptibility of viral infection , respectively .
While these apparent outcome disparities among experimental systems remain unclear , they could potentially result from variations in redundancies and compensatory mechanisms inherent to each experimental system .
Regardless , these genetic and whole-animal models set the stage to probe novel molecular pathways in various physiological and genetic contexts , and provide also a link to pathophysiological processes underlying several human diseases .
Yeast two-hybrid screening and assays .
The LD of human RanBP2 ( residues 62 -- 711 ) was subcloned in-frame into the GAL4 <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> domain of bait vector , pBUTE ( a kanamycin-resistant version of GAL4 bait vector pGBDUC1 ) [ 62 ] and HybriZAP pBD-GAL4 vector ( Stratagene , La Jolla , California , United States ) .
The former was used to screen ~ 18 million clones via <termsem="GO:0007618"> mating </term> from murine 9 - to 10-d-old embryo and brain cDNA libraries at the Molecular Interaction Facility ( MIF ) , University of Wisconsin , Madison , Wisconsin .
The latter was used to screen via <termsem="GO:0009294"> transformation </term> of ~ 5 million clones from bovine retinal cDNA libraries [ 32 ] .
The screens <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> six clones .
One and two in-frame clones were independently isolated from the embryonic and adult brain libraries , respectively , and the interactions were validated .
The three clones encoded Cox11 .
