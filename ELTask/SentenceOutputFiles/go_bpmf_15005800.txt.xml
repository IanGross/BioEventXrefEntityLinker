Late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> lung hypoplasia in a mouse model of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome .
Normal post-squalene <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> is important for mammalian <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> .
Neonatal mice lacking functional <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> ) , a model for the human disease of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome , <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> within 24 hours of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Although they have a number of biochemical and structural abnormalities , one cause of <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> is from apparent respiratory failure due to <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> pulmonary abnormalities .
In this study , we characterized further the role of cholesterol deficiency in <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> of these mice .
Significant <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation , beginning at E14 .5 ~ E16 .5 , was observed in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Normal lobation but smaller lungs with a significant decrease in lung-to-body weight ratio was noted in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos , compared to controls .
Lung <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> was comparable between <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and controls at early stages , but delayed saccular <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> was visible in all <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos from E17 .5 onwards .
Impaired pre - <termsem="GO:0048286"> alveolar development </term> of varying severity , inhibited <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> , delayed differentiation of type I alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs ) and delayed <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> were all evident in knockout lungs .
<termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> of type II AECs was apparently normal as judged by surfactant protein ( SP ) mRNAs and SP-C immunostaining .
A significant amount of cholesterol was detectable in knockout lungs , implicating some maternal <termsem="GO:0030301"> transfer of cholesterol </term> .
No significant differences of the spatial-temporal <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) or its downstream targets by immunohistochemistry were detected between knockout and wild-type lungs and Shh <termsem="GO:0016540"> autoprocessing </term> occurred normally in tissues from <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Our data indicated that cholesterol deficiency caused by <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null was associated with a distinct lung saccular hypoplasia , characterized by failure to terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> alveolar sacs , a delayed <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of type I AECs and an immature vascular network at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages .
The molecular mechanism of impaired lung development associated with sterol deficiency by <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> loss is still unknown , but these results do not support the involvement of dysregulated Shh-Patched-Gli pathway in causing this defect .
Cholesterol is a necessary membrane constituent of all mammalian , reptile and avian cells , as well as a few other organisms , but not all eukaryotic organisms .
In the latter cases , such as plants and fungi , cholesterol-like sterols ( phytosterols , ergosterol etc. ) seem to substitute for cholesterol .
The precise need for sterols in biological membranes still remains poorly defined , though its link with microdomains ( variously termed rafts , caveoli etc. ) may be part of the answer [ 1 ] .
Although the accumulation of cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques has led to the concept that ` too much ' cholesterol may be deleterious , too little cholesterol has now been proven pathophysiological for abnormal <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> .
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS , MIM 270400 ) , a relative common dysmorphology disorder , is caused by mutations in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> DHCR7 </term> </term> [ 2-5 ] , which encodes for <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> 7-dehydrocholesterol 7-reductase </term> </term> and catalyzes a final step of <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> .
Recognition of other dysmorphology syndromes caused by defects in the post-squalene <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis pathway </term> , such as desmosterolosis , lathosterolosis , X-linked chondrodysplasia punctanta and CHILD syndrome [ 6-15 ] , has strengthened this concept .
Genetic disruption of the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> results in neonatal lethality [ 16 ] .
Neonatal mice homozygous for the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> gene disruption are deficient in cholesterol and have increased accumulation of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol ( 7DHC ) .
Although no embryonic lethality was noted , these knockout pups exhibited a number of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities and <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> within 24 h after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
A similar mouse SLOS model , <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by replacing exons 3 , 4 and part of exon 5 of the murine <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> gene , with similar biochemical and structural defects and a 100 % neonatal lethality , has also been reported [ 17 ] .
Poor <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> or diffuse lung alveolar atelectasis with cyanotic and lethargic breathing are consistent between both <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null models [ 16,17 ] , and therefore is the likely reason for the respiratory insufficiency and subsequent <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - pups .
These <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> knockout mice are models for human SLOS , especially the more severely affected patients , since early postnatal lethality with respiratory failure has been reported in severe SLOS cases [ 4,5 ] .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Developmental </term> lung abnormalities are also relatively common in SLOS patients , including pulmonary hypoplasia , abnormal pulmonary lobation and pulmonary arteries , anomalies of laryngeal and tracheal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 18 ] .
Mammalian lung is unique in that it is fully <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> , but does not function for <termsem="GO:0007585"> gas exchange </term> until at the moment of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ; the majority of structural <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> takes place in utero .
<termsem="GO:0030324"> Lung development </term> is a complex process that involves <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> of epithelium , interstitial <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> including <termsem="GO:0001570"> vasculogenesis </term> , <termsem="GO:0030154"> cellular differentiation </term> , biochemical <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and physical <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> .
Four stages of mouse <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> have been described , based upon the histological appearances of lung ; pseudoglandular , canalicular , terminal saccular and alveolar stages [ 19 ] .
Impaired hedgehog function has been proposed as a mechanism underlying malformations found in SLOS .
Hedgehog family members play diverse roles in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> , and cholesterol is necessary for <termsem="GO:0051604"> maturation </term> of these <termsem="GO:0016015"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> morphogens </term> </term> [ 20-23 ] .
The sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) signaling cascade has been shown to play a central role in <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> [ 24-26 ] .
Loss of Shh function resulted in severe lung defects associated with loss of <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> , but preserved proximal-to-distal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of lung epithelium [ 24 ] .
Overexpression of Shh in the distal lung epithelium resulted in the absence of functional alveoli and an increase in interstitial tissue caused by an increased proliferation of both epithelial and mesenchyme cells [ 26 ] .
Mice with Shh overexpression <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> less than 24 h after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , probably owing to respiratory failure .
It has been reported that inhibition of <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> by chemical inhibitors of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> also led to a disturbance of the Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> with abnormal <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> [ 27,28 ] , and severe sterol deprivation can indeed inhibit the <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> of <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> Shh in cultured mammalian cells [ 29 ] .
In the present studies , we characterized <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos from E10 .5 to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Our results showed that cholesterol deficiency , caused by loss of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> activity , did not alter lung <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> ( early <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages , E9 .5 to E14 .5 ) .
However , lung saccular development was impaired , with arrested or partially <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> epithelial tubules and delayed <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> .
Differentiation of type II alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs ) appeared normal but <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of type I AECs was severely impaired .
Therefore , cholesterol deficiency resulted in a distinct late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> lung hypoplasia , characterized by impaired sacculation with delayed type I AECs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and immature <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> .
However , this study does not support the concept that the perturbation of Shh-Patched-Gli pathway was involved in the pathogenesis of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> lung hypoplasia in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Patterns of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling cascade </term> members were not altered , and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> of Shh appeared normal .
Body <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> stage in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
<termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - mice were <termsem="GO:0007567"> born </term> in the expected Mendelian ratios from heterozygous parents , but all of these pups <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> within 24 h and most within 14 h of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> [ 16 ] .
At <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , they were clearly smaller than wild-type or heterozygous littermates .
An experienced investigator can pick out knockout pups based on this along with presence of hypoxia and their lack of spontaneous <termsem="GO:0050879"> movement </term> .
The breathing frequency in P0 <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - pups was markedly slower than control littermates ( 34  7 breaths/min in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - , n = 10 vs. 92  16 breaths/min in controls , n = 32 , p < 0.001 ) and the breathing was observed to be more irregular and shallow , with long periods of apnea .
To determine the <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stage at which <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> of the knockout embryos was affected , embryos were harvested at various stages of <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> and their body lengths compared between <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and controls .
A linear increase in body length from E9 .5 to E19 .5 in control embryos was observed ( Fig. 1 ) .
No significant differences in body length between wild-type and heterozygous embryos were noted ( data not shown ) .
In contrast , knockout embryos showed comparable body length <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> until E14 .5 ~ E16 .5 , then began to show a slower increase in length , such that by E17 .5 , this was statistically significant ( 18.87  1.29 mm in controls , n = 15 compared to 16.69  1.05 mm in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - , n = 7 , p < 0.05 , Fig. 1 ) .
Body length <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> curves .
Body length <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> vs. <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> days is as shown .
Control embryos ( filled triangles , wild-type and heterozygous embryos were pooled together as there were no differences between these two groups ) and knockout embryos ( filled circles ) were as shown .
The <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> curve showed a linear increase from E9 .5 to E19 .5 in controls , but deviated at ~ E14 .5 in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Body lengths at E17 .5 ( 18.87  1.29 mm in controls , n = 15 vs. 16.69  1.05 mm in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - , n = 7 , p < 0.05 ) , E18 .5 ( 21.35  1.05 mm in controls , n = 15 vs. 19.38  0.9 mm in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - , n = 5 , p < 0.05 ) and E19 .5 ( 23.4  0.97 mm in controls , n = 13 vs. 20.3  0.44 mm in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - , n = 4 , p < 0.05 ) were significantly decreased , compared to those in controls .
Results are expressed as mean  s.d. <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos at late stages displayed pulmonary hypoplasia with delayed saccular <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Wet lung weights , as well as lung to body weight ratios were significantly lower in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - at E18 .5 compared to those in wild-type but not at E13 .5 ( Table 1 ) .
Both body and lung weights were reduced , but lungs seemed to be more affected .

At P0 , the knockout pups were significantly smaller and appeared hypoxic ( panel B ) .
Panel C shows dorsal views of lungs from knockout and wild-type at E13 .5 and panel D those at P0 .
Cross-sectional examination at the cardiopulmonary level at E 20.5 ( prior to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ) showed normal lobar septation , but lungs from knockout animals were smaller in size and had less distal sac space ( cf. panels E and F ) .

Labels : r , right ; l , left ; b , bronchial ; br , bronchiole ; e , esophagus ; pa , pulmonary artery ; ra , right atrium ; la , left atrium ; rv , right ventricle ; lv , left ventricle .
We examined the lungs for any gross morphological abnormalities .
The overall <termsem="GO:0030324"> organogenesis of lungs </term> was preserved in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - pups ; four right lung lobes and a single left lobe flanking the heart were easily seen on external examination at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( Fig. 2D ) .
Examination for lobation at E13 .5 also showed comparable gross anatomy ( Fig. 2C ) between wild-type and knockout embryos .
Histological analyses of the cardiopulmonary structures at E20 .5 , taken just before <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> to avoid artifacts from lack of lung inflation , also confirmed normal gross <termsem="GO:0048856"> anatomic development </term> ( Fig. 2E and 2F ) .
Additionally , no cardiac defects were identified and this was confirmed by more detailed histological analyses ( data not shown ) .
Thus , despite the obvious hypoxia frequently observed at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> of the knockout pups , major cardiac structural abnormalities were not observed to account for this phenotype .
No distinguishable morphological differences were discernable between <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and wild-type lungs at E10 .5 , E13 .5 , E14 .5 and E16 .5 at low ( 10X ) or high ( 40X ) magnifications ( Fig. 3 , panel A : a-h , data for E10 .5 and E13 .5 not shown ) .
However , from E17 .5 onwards , lungs from knockout embryos appeared to have less saccular space and relatively more mesenchyme compared to wild-type lungs ( Fig. 3 , panel A : I-x ) .
Lungs from control animals showed normal progression with <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of sac-like structures , the precursors of the alveoli ( Fig. 3 , panel A : i , m , q and u ) .
In lungs from knockout embryos , <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> of epithelial tubules occurred but was significantly delayed ( Fig. 3 , cf. panel A : j , n , r , v with i , m , q and u ) .
Morphometric measurements of lung sections at E17 .5 , E18 .5 , E20 .5 and in lungs from neonates showed that the proportion of terminal sac space area was significantly decreased in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs , compared wild-type lungs ( Fig. 3 , panel B ) .
Interstitial mesenchyme appeared thicker and the lungs had less septation compared to control lungs .
This ` thickening ' of the alveoli may explain the hypoxia frequently seen in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - pups at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Histological analyses of lungs at various embryonic stages .
Panel A indicates lung sections stained with H and E , and taken at various <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages as indicated .
The first two columns are at lower magnification ( 10X ) and the last two columns at higher magnification ( 40X ) .
The first and third columns are representative sections from wild-type ( + / + ) embryos and the second and fourth columns from knockout ( - / - ) embryos .
No differences were visible at E14 .5 or E16 .5 ( panel A , a-h ) .
Significant differences were visible from E17 .5 onwards ( panel A , i-x ) .
Distal tubules showed dilation and mesenchyme thinning , with progression of septation in wild-type lungs ( panel A , i , m and q ) , whereas the knockout lungs showed less saccular structures and more mesenchyme ( panel A , j , n and r ) .
At higher magnifications of wild-type lungs ( panel A , k , o and s ) , <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> pre-alveoli and thinning mesenchyme ( arrowheads ) were seen but sections from knockout embryos showed a delay in this sequence of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( panel A , l , p and t ) .
At <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , lungs from knockout pups showed deficient septation and thick-walled mesenchyme ( panel A , x , arrowheads ) .
Labels : de , distal epithelium ; m , mesenchyme ; PA , pulmonary artery ; a , pre-alveoli ; b , bronchi .
Panel B shows the morphometric analyses of lung terminal sac spaces in lungs at various <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages .
A significant reduction in the terminal sac space was noted from E17 .5 onwards .
Results are expressed as mean  s.d. Attenuated <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> in late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs .
Does the loss of normal <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> lead to abnormalities of <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> / division or <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> ?
<termsem="GO:0008283"> Cell proliferation </term> was examined by immunostaining for PCNA and also by BrdU incorporation .
Both PCNA and BrdU staining of wild-type and knockout lungs at early <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages ( E13 .5 and E14 .5 ) showed comparable patterns ( Fig. 4 , panels A-D ) .
However , a clear reduction of PCNA and BrdU labeling was visualized in distal lungs of knockout embryos at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages ( E18 .5 and E20 .5 , Fig. 4 , panels E-H ) .
Attenuated PCNA labeling was also noted in knockout hearts at term ( Fig. 4 , cf. panels I and J ) .
When lungs were stained for pHH3 , a marker of active <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> , a clear reduction of pHH3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the epithelium of knockout lung was observed at E20 .5 but not at E14 .5 ( Fig. 4 , panels K , L , O and P ) .
In contrast , using the TUNEL assay , no apparent differences in <termsem="GO:0006915"> cell apoptosis </term> rates were observed between wild-type and knockout lungs at E18 .5 ( Fig. 4 , cf. panels M and N ) .
Thus , at the late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages , <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> / division was impaired in knockout embryos with no increase in <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> rates .
Analyses of <termsem="GO:0008283"> cell proliferation </term> , <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> and <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> .
<termsem="GO:0008283"> Cell proliferation </term> ( PCNA : panels A , B , E and F ; BrdU : panels C , D , G and H ) , <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> ( pHH3 : panels K , L , O and P ) and <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> ( TUNEL : panels M and N ) were analyzed by immunostaining on lung sections at early and late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages .
Both PCNA and BrdU labeled cells in both epithelial and mesenchymal regions were comparable at early stages ( E14 .5 for PCNA and E13 .5 for BrdU ) between wild-type ( + / + ) and knockout ( - / - ) lungs .
Positively stained cells in distal lungs at late stage ( E20 .5 for PCNA and E18 .5 for BrdU ) from knockout lungs were markedly reduced , compared with wild-type .
PCNA labeling of cardiac muscle was also attenuated in knockout embryos at E20 .5 ( cf. panels I and J ) .
No apparent differences in TUNEL immunostaining were observed in lung sections at E18 .5 between wild-type and knockout .
The pHH3 immunostaining was comparable between wild-type and knockout lungs at E14 .5 , and the lungs from wild-type at E20 .5 showed a high index of positive cells , whereas lungs from knockout showed a apparent reduced staining pattern .
Note the <termsem="GO:0051301"> dividing </term> cells are mainly epithelial .

Sterol content of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> lungs in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficient mice .
Markedly elevated 7-DHC/8-DHC levels and reduced body cholesterol levels have been reported previously in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - P0 mice [ 16,17 ] .
A significant amount of cholesterol was detectable in lungs of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - mice , comprising ~ 60 % and ~ 30 % of total tissue sterols at E13 .5 and neonate , respectively .
In contrast to the doubling of cholesterol in the lungs of wild type embryos ( 1.82 mg/g tissue at E13 .5 to 3.55 mg/g tissue at P0 ) , cholesterol content in the lungs of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null embryos remained at almost constant low levels between E13 .5 and P0 <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages ( Fig. 5 ) .
There was a progressive increase in 7-DHC and 8-DHC ; the latter is <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> as a spontaneous isomerization from the former .
Total sterols at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> were reduced in lungs of the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null mice , but were only lower by ~ 30 % ( Fig. 5 , see values for P0 mice ) .
Sterol analyses of embryonic lungs .
Sterol contents , including cholesterol ( black bars ) and 7DHC/8DHC ( white bars ) , were quantitated by GC-MS in the lungs from wild-type ( + / + ) and knockout ( - / - ) embryos .
Results are expressed as mean  s.d and the number of lungs analyzed is as indicated .
Total sterols were lower at all stages in knockout lungs , with almost no increase in cholesterol content with time ( black bars ) , but there was a progressive increment in the precursor sterols , 7DHC/8DHC ( open bars ) , with increasing <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> .
Cholesterol is absolutely required for steroid <termsem="GO:0042446"> <termsem="GO:0005179"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> hormone </term> </term> synthesis </term> by the adrenal glands .
Adrenal insufficiency , as has been reported in some severe cases of SLOS patients , could be responsible for the lung hypoplasia and perinatal lethality [ 30 ] .
Steroids , but particularly corticosteroids , are necessary for lung <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> , especially the <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesis </term> and <termsem="GO:0046903"> secretion </term> of surfactant components [ 31 ] .
We determined plasma corticosterone levels in P0 mice within 12 h of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Wild type P0 mice had corticosterone levels of 158  50 ng/ml ( n = 11 ) , compared with 225  50 ng/ml ( n = 7 , p < 0.01 ) in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - P0 mice .
Thus , the corticosterone levels in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - mice were not decreased , but increased by ~ 40 % .
However , since these P0 mice were <termsem="GO:0016265"> dying </term> , perhaps this increase was sub-optimal given the stress .
Nevertheless , an absolute lack of corticosterone was not present in these knockout pups .
To further rule out any effects of corticosterone deficiency on lung immaturity , we examined lungs for surfactant protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Surfactant protein C , as determined by IHC , was comparable in lung sections from wild-type or <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null embryos at either E18 .5 or at E20 .5 <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> ages ( Fig. 6 , panel A ) .
Northern analyses for SP-A , SP-B , SP-C or SP-D showed no significantly differences between wild-type and <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null mice at term ( Fig. 6 , panel B ) .
Thus , surfactant protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was not altered by <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficiency .
Surfactant protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in lungs .
Panel A shows the immunostaining patterns for SP-C in lungs at E18 .5 and E20 .5 from wild-type ( + / + ) and knockout ( - / - ) embryos .
No significant differences in the patterns of SP-C staining were evident between wild-type and knockout lungs ( panel A , a-d ) .
Note that the underdeveloped epithelial tubules in knockout lungs also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> SP-C ( panel A , b and d , arrowheads ) , indicating normal type II AECs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Original magnification : 10X .
Panel B , left-hand panel , shows a representative result from Northern analyses of total RNA from wild-type , heterozygous and knockout P0 lungs for SP-A , SP-B , SP-C and SP-D <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Densitometry analyses showed the relative <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( n = 3 , mean  s.d. ) of these surfactant protein mRNAs were not significantly different between these three genotypes .
<termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs showed abnormal differentiation of type I alveolar epithelial cells ( AECs ) .
At E20 .5 , the distal lung of wild type embryos consisted of saccular structures lined by flat type I AECs , and by cuboidal surfactant - <termsem="GO:0009058"> producing </term> type II AECs ( Fig. 7A ) .
In contrast , the <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of these typical saccules was impaired in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficient lungs .
Instead , these saccular structures were lined by a low columnar epithelium that lacked flattened type I-like cells with the presence of many undeveloped or arrested epithelial tubules ( Fig. 7B ) .
Consistent with disruption of type I AECs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> was the dramatic reduction of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of T1 , an apical membrane protein marker of lung type I AECs ( Fig. 7 , cf. panels C and D ) .
Decreased immunostaining for AQP5 , another type I AEC marker , was also noted in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficient lungs at E20 .5 , compared to control lungs ( Fig. 7 , cf. panels E and F ) .
Megalin , a <termsem="GO:0005041"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> low density lipoprotein receptor </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0005041"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> LDLR </term> </term> ) gene family member , is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by embryonic epithelial cells and can function as an <termsem="GO:0006897"> endocytic </term> Shh <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> [ 32 ] .
Megalin was highly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> on the distal epithelium at E20 .5 from wild-type lungs , as well as type I AECs lining the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> saccules ( Fig. 7G ) .
In contrast , though megalin staining was detected in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> saccules in knockout embryonic lungs , its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was confined to undifferentiated cuboidal cells ( Fig. 7H ) , further indicating a delay in type I AECs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the knockout lungs .
Characterization of type I AECs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
The normal distal saccules of wild-type ( + / + ) at near term ( E20 .5 ) showed typical type I ( t1 ) and type II ( t2 ) epithelial cells ( panel A , arrowheads ) , but knockout ( - / - ) littermate lungs showed less <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> saccules lined by columnar epithelial cells ( panel B , black arrowheads ) , with partially arrested tubules in the distal lung ( panel B , green arrowheads ) .
Immunostaining for type I cell markers T1 and AQP5 demonstrated an intense staining in flat epithelial cells in wild-type lungs at E20 .5 ( panels C and E , arrowheads ) .
In contrast , in knockout littermate lungs , T1 and AQP5 staining was dramatically decreased ( panels D and F , arrowheads ) .
Megalin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Meg ) was detected in the airway epithelial cells , but not in proximal bronchiole epithelial cells ( data not shown ) in the lungs from both wild-type and knockout at E20 .5 .
The elongated megalin-positive epithelial cells , lining the normally <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> sacculi , were readily evident in many areas of the wild-type lungs .
In contrast , the terminal epithelial cells positively stained by megalin antibodies in knockout lungs were comprised mainly of undifferentiated cuboidal cells ( compare the arrowheads in G and H ) .

Delayed <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs .
There is a close relationship between <termsem="GO:0001568"> blood vessel development </term> and <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung structural development </term> .
At later <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung developmental </term> stages , timed capillary bed <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> is essential for the formation of mature alveolar <termsem="GO:0007585"> gas-exchange </term> , with a loss of mesenchyme separating the capillary beds and the AECs [ 19 ] .
In <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages , the relative abundance of mesenchyme was consistent with the general arrest in sacculation .
To investigate whether the delayed lung sacculation also involved abnormal <termsem="GO:0001568"> blood vessel development </term> , immunostaining for the -isoform of caveolin-1 ( cav-1 ) and platelet endothelial <termsem="GO:0007155"> cell adhesion </term> molecular ( PECAM-1 ) were performed on sections from wild-type and <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs .
In the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> lung , cav-1 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> strictly in the endothelium of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> capillary and blood vessels .
Cav-1 is present in the terminally <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> type I AECs , but is not detectable in its progenitors or type II AECs [ 33 ] .
At E14 .5 , both the epithelium and mesenchyme were negative for cav-1 staining , and cav-1 was detected in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> blood vessels and capillaries , with no differences observed between wild-type and <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs ( Fig. 8 , panels A and B ) .
Cav-1 immunostaining demonstrated that the <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> proceeded rapidly during saccular stages in normal lungs ( E17 .5 and E20 .5 ) .
In near-term normal lungs ( E20 .5 ) , an extensive vascular network , associated with markedly thinned septation walls of well - <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> alveoli and close apposition to flat type I AECs , was observed ( Fig. 8 , panels C and E ) .
In contrast , the cav-1 patterns in lungs from <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos revealed a relatively undeveloped pulmonary capillary bed ( Fig. 8 , panels D and F ) .
At E20 .5 , cav-1 stained cells in knockout lungs were embedded in a relatively thick mesenchyme surrounding undeveloped epithelial tubules , and these epithelial cells remained cuboidal , instead of flattening out ( Fig. 8 , panel F ) .
PECAM-1 staining at E20 .5 confirmed the delayed lung <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> at these late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficient embryos ( Fig. 8 , cf. panels G and H ) .
Immunostaining patterns for caveolin-1 and PECAM-1 in lung sections .
Cav-1 staining was compared at E14 .5 , E17 .5 and E20 .5 stages of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Both the epithelium and mesenchyme were negative for cav-1 at E14 .5 .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Developing </term> blood vessels ( red arrowheads ) and capillaries ( arrows ) ( panels A and B ) were stained positively for cav-1 , but the staining patterns between wild-type ( + / + ) and knockout ( - / - ) lungs were not altered .
Cav-1 was also detected at the proximal bronchiole sub-epithelial matrices ( panels A-D , black arrowheads ) .
At E17 .5 , the airway epithelium , negative for cav-1 staining , was surrounded by rings of cav-1 positively stained capillary networks ( panels C and D , arrows ) .
Cav-1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns in lungs from knockout embryos at E17 .5 were similar to wild-type embryos , but relative less capillary bed was noted in knockout lungs ( cf. panels C and D ) .
At E20 .5 of wild-type lungs , both cav-1 and PECAM-1 staining demonstrated an extensive vascular network in the well <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> saccules , with staining observed in close proximity to flat epithelial cells lining the air spaces ( panels E and G , arrows ) .
However , delayed <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> was observed in knockout lungs , showing capillaries ( panels F and H , arrows ) of the knockout lungs at E20 .5 were embedded in a relatively thick mesenchyme around the undeveloped epithelial tubules in which the epithelial cells were remained cuboidal ( arrowheads ) .
Original magnification : A-D are 20X ; E-H are 40X .
Is the pattern of sonic hedgehog <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> or signaling altered in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos ?
Shh is critical for normal <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> and its <termsem="GO:0016540"> autoprocessing </term> , resulting in a cholesterol molecule covalently <termsem="GO:0005488"> attached </term> at its C-terminus , is a necessary step for its <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> function [ 23,34 ] .
Thus , disruption of <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> could conceivably disrupt its pattern of <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> and thus affect normal <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
To determine whether aberrant <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Shh contributed to the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lung phenotype , <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of Shh in the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and wild-type lungs was assessed from E10 .5 to P0 by IHC using Shh-N peptide antibody .
At E10 .5 , the <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of Shh was detected in the epithelial cells of lung buds ( Fig. 9 , left panel : C and D ) , as well as in the more typical Shh - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> locations , such as the floor plate , notochord and mid gut ( Fig. 9 , left panel : A-D ) .
Importantly , no differences between <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and control embryos were noted .
Likewise , examination of lung sections from increasing <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> ages through to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> showed no significant differences between wild-type and <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficient tissues .
The patterns of staining observed were comparable to those previously reported for Shh in mouse lungs [ 25 ] .
Shh and Ptch <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns at different <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and wild-type mice .
Left panel shows the Shh immunostaining patterns using an antibody to Shh N-peptide at various <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages as indicated by the legend on the y-axis .
There were no significant differences noted at any of the stages examined between wild-type ( + / + ) and knockout ( - / - ) embryos .
At E10 .5 , Shh was detected in the floor plate ( fp ) , notochord ( nc ) ( A and B ) , mid-gut ( mg ) and the epithelial buds of lungs ( lb ) ( C and D ) .
Shh staining was restricted to epithelial cells in the distal region of the primordial tubes of lungs at E13 .5 and E15 .5 .
Note that proximal epithelial cells of primordial tubes were not immunostained for Shh ( E and F , arrows ) .
Shh was detected in the lung epithelial cells on E18 .5 , and mainly in the conducting airways in the neonates .
Original magnifications : A ~ H , K and L are 10X , I and J are 20X .
Right panel shows the patterns of Ptch IHC at various <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages .
Immunostaining of Ptch from E13 .5 to P 0 confirmed concordance with Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and was not significantly different between wild-type and knockout embryos .
Note that the proximal epithelial cells of primordial tubes were also not immunostained for Ptch at E13 .5 lungs ( arrows ) .
Original magnifications : A ~ F , I and J are 10X .
G and H are 20X .
To further investigate Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> in these embryos , we examined the patterns of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Patched ( Ptch ) , a cognate <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> for Shh and one whose <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is also <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
The patterns of Ptch in lung sections from various <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages were also indistinguishable between wild-type and knockout embryos ( Fig. 9 , right panels ) .
The <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Ptch was in concordance with that of Shh ( Fig 9 , left and right panels ) , showing lung epithelial cell <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Downstream of the Shh-Ptch <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling cascade </term> are proteins such as smoothened ( Smo ) , and Gli proteins , key regulators of target - <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
No differences in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns for Smo ( Fig. 10 , upper panels ) , Gli1 ( Fig. 10 , middle panels ) or Gli3 ( Fig. 10 , bottom panels ) were noted between wild-type and knockout lungs at E13 .5 , E15 .5 and E17 .5 <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> days .
Comparisons of Smo , Gli1 and Gli3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in lung sections .
Smoothened ( Smo , upper panel ) , Gli1 ( middle panel ) and Gli3 ( bottom panel ) showed a pattern of <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> similar to that seen with Shh and Ptch ( compare to Fig. 7 ) .
No differences between wild-type ( + / + ) and knockout ( - / - ) embryos were evident .

Shh <termsem="GO:0016485"> protein processing </term> in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Since Shh <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , as well as some of the Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> components appeared to be normal in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos , endogenous <termsem="GO:0016540"> autoprocessing </term> of Shh to <termsem="GO:0009058"> generate </term> a cholesterol - <termsem="GO:0043412"> modified </term> N-terminal fragment of Shh ( Shh-Np ) was evaluated .
COS-1 cells , <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with full length Shh cDNA ( capable of endogenous autocleavage ) or a truncated Shh cDNA ( Shh-N , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the shorter form constitutively ) were used as controls ( Fig. 11 , tracks 1 and 2 ) .
<termsem="GO:0009294"> Transfection </term> of the full-length cDNA for Shh led to the detection of an ~ 20 kD protein that corresponds with the <termsem="GO:0030908"> cleaved </term> and tailed Shh ( Fig. 11 , track 1 ) , as previously described [ 35 ] .
<termsem="GO:0009294"> Transfection </term> of COS cells with the constitutive truncated Shh-N cDNA led to two slower migrating bands that correspond to truncated Shh , but which are thought to be <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> by differences in lipid <termsem="GO:0043412"> modifications </term> , as previously demonstrated [ 35 ] .
In tissue lysates from wild-type , <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> + / - and <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos at E11 .5 , a band running at the same position as Shh-Np ( autocleaved and tailed ) was detected in all of the lysates .
There were no distinguishable differences between <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - and the wild-type samples , suggesting that Shh <termsem="GO:0016540"> autoprocessing </term> occurred normally , despite an absolute deficiency of cholesterol in knockout embryos .
More importantly , no band corresponding to a full-length Shh ( ~ 45 kD ) was present in the lung lysates from the knockout embryos , suggesting that <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> of Shh was not impaired .
Shh <termsem="GO:0016540"> protein autoprocessing </term> in mouse embryos .
Western blotting of lysates from wild-type ( track 3 ) , heterozygous ( track 4 ) and knockout ( track 5 ) embryos at E11 .5 , or COS1 cells <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with Shh ( track 1 ) or Shh-N ( track 2 ) were probed with anti-Shh-N19 antibodies .
20  g of lysate proteins from Shh <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> COS1 cells and 75  g from embryos was loaded .
Both unprocessed ( Shh , upper arrow ~ 45 kDa , faint signal ) and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processed </term> ( Shh-Np , lowest arrow , strong signal , track 1 ) forms of Shh were detected from Shh <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> COS1 cells .
The two slower migrating bands in Shh-N <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> COS1 cells ( track 2 ) represented Shh-N proteins with different lipid <termsem="GO:0043412"> modifications </term> at its N terminus .
A major band running at the same position as <termsem="GO:0016485"> processed </term> Shh was detected in lysates from all the embryos ( tracks 3 -- 5 ) .
Importantly , no significant amounts of unprocessed or aberrantly migrating Shh proteins were detected in lysates from knockout embryos at this stage .
The elucidation that SLOS is caused by a defect in an enzyme necessary for <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> has improved our understanding of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> .
This discovery has led to the identification of other disorders of <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> caused by mutations in genes encoding other enzymes in the post-squalene steps of <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> .
Although these genetic studies now implicate the need for normal <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol synthesis </term> , the mechanistic role ( s ) of cholesterol in normal <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> remains to be clarified .
In the present study , we report the characterization of <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Although cardiac abnormalities are common in human SLOS [ 36 ] , no structural abnormalities of the heart or the great vessels were observed in the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - pups .
<termsem="GO:0030324"> Lung development </term> in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos at the early stages , from lung bud <termsem="GO:0030324"> formation </term> to canalicular stage , was morphologically similar to controls .
Instead , a distinct lung hypoplasia at the saccular stage , characterized by arrested or partially <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> distal epithelial tubules , reduced terminal sac space , delayed type I AECs <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> and delayed <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> , was consistently observed at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
At late stages of normal <termsem="GO:0009790"> fetal development </term> , the mammalian alveolar epithelium undergoes an abrupt <termsem="GO:0030855"> differentiation </term> as a part of the preparation of the lungs for the postnatal demands of <termsem="GO:0007585"> gas exchange </term> [ 37 ] .
Both type II AECs , <termsem="GO:0009058"> producing </term> pulmonary surfactants , and type I AECs , lining the <termsem="GO:0008283"> expanded </term> alveoli , are important for alveolar <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> .
In addition , the <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular <termsem="GO:0048286"> development </term> of alveoli </term> is also essential for normal lung <termsem="GO:0009887"> morphogenesis </term> at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages [ 19 ] .
We show here that the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of type I AECs but not type II AECs in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs was blocked or delayed , as indicated by fewer flattened type I cells and by reduced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of markers of type I AECs , T1 and AQP5 .
Delayed <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> was also involved in the delayed sacculation of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs .
Additionally , the mesenchyme separating the AECs from the vascular beds remained thickened .
In support of normal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of type II AECs , no alteration in the <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> patterns for surfactant proteins A , B , C or D was noted , nor was the pattern of <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> of SP-C altered in lungs from knockout embryos .
Thus , impaired <termsem="GO:0007585"> gas exchange </term> , as opposed to poor inflation and alveolar tension , may be the cause of respiratory failure in these pups .
Loss of functional <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> led to a retardation of embryonic <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> from E14 .5 ~ E16 .5 onwards .
By this stage , cholesterol levels were already lower and its immediate precursor , 7-DHC , elevated in the lungs ( this study ) as well as in the whole body [ 16,17 ] .
Intrauterine <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation ( IUGR ) followed by postnatal failure to thrive is a universally observed phenotype in SLOS patients [ 2,18 ] .
We showed here that body length was significantly reduced at later stages of <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestation </term> in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - animals , compared to controls .
Whole body weights and fresh lung weights ( as well as brain , heart and kidney , data not shown ) at late <termsem="GO:0007565"> gestational </term> stages were also lower in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Interestingly , the lower lung/body ratios at E18 .5 in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos compared to wild-type suggested a disproportionate inhibition of lung <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> than other organs .
<termsem="GO:0008283"> Cell proliferation </term> and division in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - lungs were markedly arrested without apparent increase in <termsem="GO:0006915"> cell apoptosis </term> .
Therefore , it appears that <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation caused by cholesterol deficiency was primarily because of an inhibition of <termsem="GO:0016049"> cell growth </term> and proliferation , rather than an increase in <termsem="GO:0008219"> cell death </term> .
Cholesterol is present in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos , as it is in Sc5d - / - ( lathosterolosis ) and Dhcr24 - / - ( desmosterolosis ) embryos [ 15,38 ] .
Total sterols and cholesterol in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryonic lungs ( as well as in brain and liver , data not shown ) were reduced and 7DHC/8DHC elevated , but a significant amount of cholesterol was detectable , comprising ~ 60 % and ~ 30 % of total tissue sterols at E13 .5 and neonate , respectively .
Fetal cholesterol can either be <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesized </term> endogenously in fetal tissues or accrued from extra-embryonic tissues such as maternal serum , placenta , and yolk sac [ 39 ] .
Since these mice theoretically can not <termsem="GO:0009058"> synthesize </term> cholesterol , any accumulation of cholesterol must be derived from the maternal sources .
Interestingly , Dhcr24 null mice are viable but contained almost no cholesterol in plasma and tissues at 3-months , whereas cholesterol content in Dhcr24 null embryo tissues accounts for ~ 60 % at E11 .5 and ~ 30 % at E17 .5 , of total tissue sterols [ 38 ] .
These results , as well as this study , suggest that a considerable amount of maternal cholesterol can be <termsem="GO:0006810"> transferred </term> to the murine fetus .
One explanation of why the Dhcr24 - / - mice are <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmentally </term> normal but <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - mice are affected may be because desmosterol can functionally substitute for cholesterol , whereas the other cholesterol precursors can not .
Although a mechanistic understanding of why a deficiency in <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> leads to abnormal <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> is lacking , a frequently advanced explanation has been that Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , involved in early <termsem="GO:0007389"> developmental patterning </term> , may be disrupted .
In the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> lung primordium , Shh is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> initially at E9 and <termsem="GO:0048518"> promotes </term> <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> , which is impaired in Shh knockout mice [ 24 ] , suggesting that Shh , <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> by the epithelium , is critical for <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> .
In this study , the lack of evidence of abnormal lung <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> in the early stages , but a consistent delayed <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> of the <termsem="GO:0007585"> gas-exchange </term> region of the lung in the saccular period of development of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos was observed , suggesting early Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> was normal .
Shh protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and autoprocessing at E11 .5 was indistinguishable between wild-type and <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos .
Additionally , although these experiments were not quantitative , the abundance of Shh appeared unchanged between these genotypes .
Thus , it is possible that the cholesterol levels ( roughly 50 % of normal levels ) in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos were enough for completion of Shh <termsem="GO:0016540"> autoprocessing </term> or 7DHC accumulated in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryonic tissues can also participate efficiently as a sterol adduct in the Shh <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing reaction </term> [ 20 ] .
In this study , we also examined the Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathway </term> by immunohistochemistry of known key components of this pathway , such as patched , smoothened and Gli proteins .
Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> leads to the activation of <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> and increased protein levels of these components [ 40-42 ] .
If Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> were defective in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos , these could have resulted in abnormalities of the staining patterns of these components , but no such disturbance was detected .
Indeed , the patterns of protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> seemed comparable and indistinguishable from wild-type embryos at all stages of <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> examined .
In a recent in vitro study [ 43 ] , mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryos , <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> in lipid-depleted culture and transiently treated with cyclodextrin , showed no affect on Shh <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> .
However , a deficiency in their ability to <termsem="GO:0050896"> respond </term> to Shh activation , as judged by reporter <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , was demonstrable .
In contrast , when CHO cells , that stably <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> Shh , were subjected to sterol deprivation , an arrest of Shh <termsem="GO:0016540"> autoprocessing </term> was clearly demonstrable [ 29 ] .
In the present study , we did not detect unprocessed Shh in <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> - / - embryonic tissues at E11 .5 .
Subtle differences in Shh <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal transduction </term> can not be excluded by the present study .
However , we favor a model whereby the loss of normal <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol biosynthesis </term> is important , not so much for Shh autocleavage , as for the loss of the correct plasma membrane milieu .
Since the loss of cholesterol content in the plasma membrane ( and perhaps any membrane ) is likely to alter the function of <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> more sensitive to this , loss of normal <termsem="GO:0006695"> cholesterol synthesis </term> may cause a loss of <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal transduction </term> of a host of such pathways .
Thus , this effect may not be limited to the Shh pathway and other targets may be more important .
This hypothesis is amenable to testing in the <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> null mice .
Cholesterol deficiency caused by <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> deficiency in mice resulted in , along with IUGR , a distinct lung saccular hypoplasia with impaired <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of type I but not type II AECs and delayed associated <termsem="GO:0001944"> vascular development </term> .
Loss of the correct amounts of cholesterol in the membranes may perturb those <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> that depend upon cholesterol for efficient <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal transduction </term> .
Further investigation of which transcriptional and <termsem="GO:0007165"> signal transduction pathways </term> are more significantly affected by the loss of <termsem="GO:0047598"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Dhcr7 </term> </term> will be critical to elucidate the mechanism of lung hypoplasia of this model , as well as the role of cholesterol in <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonic development </term> .
All mice were housed in an animal facility at 22 C with a 12 h light ~ 12 h dark cycle and all protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee .
