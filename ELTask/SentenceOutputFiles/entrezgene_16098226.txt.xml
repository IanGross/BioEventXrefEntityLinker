A screen for proteins that interact with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> : C-terminal mutations disrupt interaction with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
The <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein is a transcriptional regulator with a key role in ocular and neurological development .
Individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> gene have malformations of the eye and brain .
Little is known about the interactions of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> with other proteins , so we carried out a systematic screen for proteins that interact with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> .
We used bioinformatics techniques to characterise a highly conserved peptide at the C-terminus of the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein .
Yeast two-hybrid library screens were then carried out to identify brain-expressed proteins that interact with the C-terminal peptide and with the entire <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> proline-serine-threonine-rich domain .
Three novel <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> - interacting proteins were identified : the post-synaptic density ( PSD ) protein <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , the dynein subunit <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> , and the tripartite motif protein <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
Three C-terminal <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations , previously identified in patients with eye malformations , all reduced or abolished the interactions .
Our preliminary data suggest that <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> interacts with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
We propose that the interaction of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> with <termsem="EG:9454"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:8655"> DNCL1 </term> is a mechanism by which synaptic activation could lead to changes in neuronal transcriptional activity , and that some of the neural anomalies in patients with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations could be explained by impaired protein-protein interactions .
The PAX6 protein is a member of the PAX ( paired-box ) family of transcriptional regulators and is essential for normal ocular and neural development [ 1 ] .
Heterozygous mutations of the <termsem="EG:5080"> human PAX6 </term> gene cause aniridia ( absence of the iris ) and a range of other congenital eye malformations [ 2 ] .
Neural defects such as foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve hypoplasia are common in <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> - associated eye disease [ 3-5 ] .
Homozygous mutations in man and mouse are lethal and result in severe developmental abnormalities including anophthalmia , severe reduction of the olfactory structures and gross brain malformations [ 2,6 ] .
The roles of <termsem="EG:25509"> PAX6 </term> in brain development have mainly been studied in homozygous mutant mice or rats and include arealisation of the cerebral cortex [ 7 ] , formation of the prosencephalon-mesencephalon boundary [ 8 ] , axon guidance [ 8 ] , differentiation of neurons from glia [ 9 ] and neuronal migration in the cerebellum [ 10 ] .
The discovery of multiple and diverse roles for <termsem="EG:18508"> PAX6 </term> in brain development prompted MRI analyses of aniridia patients , and a range of distinctive brain anomalies were uncovered .
The most common and striking of these was absence or hypoplasia of the anterior commissure [ 11 ] .
Other defects included absence or hypoplasia of the pineal gland , cortical polymicrogyria , white matter changes in the corpus callosum and grey matter changes in the cerebellum [ 11-13 ] .
Functional changes included hyposmia and abnormal inter-hemispheric auditory transfer [ 11,14 ] .
The defining feature of all PAX proteins is the presence of a 128 amino acid DNA-binding paired domain that has been highly conserved over evolution [ 1 ] .
In addition to the paired domain , PAX6 also contains a DNA-binding homeodomain and a proline , serine and threonine-rich ( PST ) domain at the C-terminus [ 1,6 ] .
The PST domain , which encompasses the C-terminal 145 amino acids of PAX6 , has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator [ 6 ] .
The PAX6 protein directly regulates a wide range of target genes [ 1,2 ] including Pax2 [ 15 ] , Ngn2 [ 16 ] and glucagon [ 17 ] .
The Pax6 gene has a spatially and temporally complex expression pattern in the eye , brain , nasal structures , spinal cord and pancreas [ 1 ] .
Although PAX6 is clearly involved in multiple developmental processes , common themes are now emerging concerning the role of PAX6 in neural tissues .
Gradients of Pax6 expression are important for determining positional characteristics in the retina [ 18 ] and the neocortex [ 7 ] .
PAX6 plays a role in development of specific axonal connections between the retina and the brain [ 18 ] and within the forebrain [ 8,19 ] .
It is also involved in the differentiation of neural cell types from multipotent precursors in the retina [ 16 ] and the cerebral cortex [ 9 ] through activation of bHLH genes such as Ngn2 and Mash1 .
These studies provide a clear link between PAX6 function in the retina and the brain , and are of particular relevance to the neurological phenotypes of individuals with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations .
It is becoming apparent that transcription factors do not act in isolation but are dependent on interactions with other proteins to carry out their function [ 20,21 ] .
These interactions introduce more specificity into the regulatory function of a given transcription factor .
To date only three PAX6 protein-protein interactions have been described : with SOX2 on the lens-specific enhancer element of the -crystallin gene [ 22 ] ; with MDIA , which modulates PAX6 activity in early neuronal development [ 23 ] , and with MAF proteins on the glucagon promoter , which causes increased expression of this pancreatic hormone gene [ 17 ] .
Here we report the preliminary results of the first systematic screen for proteins that interact with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> .
We used sequence alignment algorithms and secondary structure prediction programs to define a new domain of 32 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein .
We then screened a brain library with this peptide using the yeast two-hybrid technique and identified three novel interacting proteins , <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
The interaction between <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> and these proteins was disrupted by naturally occurring C-terminal <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations .
A highly conserved C-terminal PAX6 peptide .
We and others [ 31-33 ] noted that there is significant sequence conservation at the C-terminal end of the PAX6 protein .
BLAST analysis of the amino acid sequence of the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> PST domain ( aa 278 -- 422 ) revealed a highly conserved motif within the last 28 amino acids ( beginning at the ` GLISP ' motif , Figure 1a ) .
Strong conservation was seen in distantly related species such as axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum ) and sea urchin ( Paracentrotus lividus ) ( Figure 1a ) .
Characterisation of the PAX6 C-terminal peptide .
( a ) CLUSTAL alignment of the terminal 42 amino acids of PAX6 from diverse species .
( * ) indicates invariant residues , ( :) indicates highly similar substitutions and ( . )
indicates moderately similar substitutions .
( b ) Secondary structure analysis of the highly conserved terminal 28 amino acids predicts a single beta sheet ( arrow ) in the SVPVQ peptide .
( c ) When 4 residues are added in the N-terminal direction , 2 beta sheets are now predicted .
We subjected the whole <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> PST domain to secondary structure analysis using JPRED , a program that uses a number of different protein structure prediction algorithms to generate a consensus secondary structure ( Figure 1 ) [ 25,26 ] .
The PST domain was largely devoid of predicted secondary structure except for the C-terminal region , which contained two predicted beta sheets within the highly conserved domain , one in the ` GLISP ' motif and one in the ` SPVPQ ' motif ( identical to the pattern shown in Figure 1c ) .
Initially we defined the C-terminal domain as running from the ` GLISP ' motif up to the stop codon , since this region was most highly conserved and contained strongly predicted secondary structure elements .
However when we performed secondary structure prediction analysis on this 28 amino acid peptide , the first beta sheet was lost ( Figure 1b ) .
Addition of another 4 amino acids ( TTST ) immediately before ` GLISP ' caused recovery of the first beta sheet ( Figure 1c ) .
Although these 4 residues are not highly conserved ( Figure 1a ) , they appear to be important for seeding the first beta sheet and therefore for secondary structure .
Thus we define the C-terminal peptide as being the final 32 amino acids of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> , running from threonine 391 to the stop codon ( top line of Figure 1c ) .
We hypothesised that the C-terminal peptide might be involved in protein-protein interactions , and we tested this by screening a cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system with a construct ( PAX6CTP ) in which the 32 amino acid C-terminal peptide was fused to the <termsem="EG:855828"> yeast GAL4 </term> DNA binding domain .
We chose to screen a mouse brain cDNA library as no human libraries were available .
Given the fact that the amino acid sequence of the PAX6 protein is identical in man and mouse , we reasoned that a mouse brain library would yield relevant interactors .
For comparison we also carried out the screen using a construct containing the whole PST domain ( PAX6PST ) .
The C-terminal peptide screen gave 15 colonies that were positive with all three reporters and the PST domain screen gave 62 colonies .
The interacting plasmids were isolated and the cDNA inserts sequenced .
Three cDNAs were identified 3 or more times , <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> ( NM_011984 ) , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> ( <termsem="EG:56455"> Dynein cytoplasmic light chain 1 </term> , NM_019682 , also known as <termsem="EG:56455"> Pin </term> or <termsem="EG:56455"> Dlc8 </term> ) and <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> ( <termsem="EG:94091"> Tripartite motif protein family member 11 </term> , NM_053168 ) .
<termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> ( 6 clones ) and <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> ( 2 clones ) were identified in the C-terminal peptide screen .
<termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> ( 7 clones ) , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> ( 2 clones ) and <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> ( 6 clones ) were identified in the PST domain screen .
All cDNA inserts were in-frame with the coding region of the pPC86 <termsem="EG:855828"> GAL4 </term> activation domain .
None of the cDNAs was present in a list of known false positives [ 34 ] .
HOMER3 is a member of the HOMER family of neuronal post-synaptic density ( PSD ) proteins [ 35 ] .
DNCL1 is a subunit of two motor protein complexes , dynein and myosin-Va , both of which are involved in intracellular trafficking of proteins and organelles in neurons [ 36,37 ] .
TRIM11 is a member of the tripartite motif protein family and contains a RING finger , a B-box zinc finger , a coiled coil domain and a B30 .2 domain [ 38 ] .
The possible significance of the interactions between these proteins and <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> is discussed below .
To check that the <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> clones were not identified multiple times solely because they are highly abundant in the library , we performed a semi-quantitative PCR assay .
We compared the relative abundance of <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> , <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> and <termsem="EG:18508"> Pax6 </term> with <termsem="EG:14433"> Gapdh </term> and <termsem="EG:11946"> Atp5a1 </term> .
Gapdh and Atp5a1 both show strong constitutive expression in a variety of tissues including the brain [ 29,30 ] .
<termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> , <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> and <termsem="EG:18508"> Pax6 </term> were only amplified strongly after 35 cycles of PCR ( Figure 2 ) and were therefore present at relatively low levels compared to <termsem="EG:14433"> Gapdh </term> ( amplified strongly after 25 cycles ) and <termsem="EG:11946"> Atp5a1 </term> ( amplified strongly after 30 cycles ; Figure 2 ) .

Library cDNA was amplified with primers specific for <termsem="EG:18508"> Pax6 </term> ( 600 bp ) , <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> ( 485 bp band ) , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> ( 485 bp ) and <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> ( 609 bp ) for 20 , 25 , 30 or 35 cycles .
<termsem="EG:11946"> Atp5a1 </term> ( 415 bp ) and <termsem="EG:14433"> Gapdh </term> ( 450 bp ) , which are highly expressed in the brain , are included for comparison .
M indicates the   174 HaeIII DNA size marker ; the positions of the 603 bp and 310 bp marker bands are indicated .
We concluded that <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> clones were not highly abundant in the library .
This is consistent with the idea that they were pulled out because the encoded proteins interact specifically with the C-terminal peptide or PST domain of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> .
Yeast two-hybrid pairwise interactions .
By library screening we identified two proteins ( <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> ) that interact with the C-terminal peptide and three proteins ( <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> ) that interact with the whole PST domain .
This suggests that <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> interact specifically with the C-terminal peptide while <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> interacts with a more N-terminal part of the PST domain .
We conducted pairwise tests between specific constructs to confirm the interactions identified in the library screen and to further investigate the interaction between <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> and <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
The <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> clones that were pulled out of the library were full-length , but the <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> cDNAs lacked the N-terminal 70 amino acids .
The missing coding region was inserted into the truncated <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> cDNA to give a full-length expression construct ( see Methods ) .
Pairwise interactions were carried out with both the full-length and truncated <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> clones .
We confirmed that the whole <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> PST domain interacts with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> ( full-length and truncated constructs ) , <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> , as all three reporter genes were strongly activated in pairwise tests ( Figure 3 ; Table 1 ) .
In contrast the interaction between the C-terminal peptide and <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> or <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> could not be confirmed with pairwise tests ( Table 1 ) .
Occasionally , partial suppression of growth on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid was observed , indicating low-level activation of the URA3 reporter ; however HIS3 and LacZ activation were not observed .
The reasons for this are not clear , although it may be that the pairwise tests were of sub-optimal sensitivity compared to the library screen .
However we were able to confirm that the C-terminal peptide is important for the interaction with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> because interaction with the PAX6PST-CT construct , which lacks the final 32 amino acids , was completely abolished ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
<termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> interacted equally well with PAX6PST and PAX6PST-CT ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
This is consistent with the library screens in which <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> was isolated with the PST domain but not with the C-terminal peptide and supports the idea that the C-terminal peptide is not important for the interaction between <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .

Having confirmed that <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> interact with the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> PST domain , we next investigated how the interactions were affected by three C-terminal <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations that have been previously described in patients with ocular anomalies .
The first mutation is a single nucleotide substitution 1627A > G that causes a glutamine to arginine amino acid substitution in the last codon of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> .
This missense mutation ( Q422R ) has been reported in two patients , one affected by anterior segment dysgenesis with uveal ectropion and one with typical aniridia and foveal hypoplasia [ 27,33 ] .
The second mutation ( 1615del10 ) was found in an aniridia family [ 28 ] .
This frame-shifting deletion occurs just before the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> stop codon and is predicted to cause translational read-through into the 3 ' untranslated region , generating a protein in which the last 5 amino acids of the C-terminal peptide are replaced by a 103 amino acid-extension .
Affected individuals in this family showed unusual neurobehavioural traits including impaired social cognition and poor verbal inhibition [ 28 ] .
MRI analysis revealed grey matter abnormalities in the frontal lobe , temporal lobe and cerebellum , and white matter deficits in the corpus callosum [ 13 ] .
The third mutation 1629insT ( X423L ) has been reported in several aniridia patients [ 11,12,27,33 ] .
Insertion of a single T nucleotide at position 1629 changes the stop codon ( TAA ) to a leucine codon ( TTA ) and generates a full length <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein with a C-terminal extension that extends for a further 35 amino acids into the 3 ' untranslated region .
MRI analysis of six patients with this mutation revealed variable brain defects including absence or hypoplasia of the anterior commissure , pineal gland and olfactory bulbs [ 12 ] .
Two patients had temporal polymicrogyria , one in association with epilepsy [ 12 ] .
The three mutations were introduced into the PAX6PST construct , and pairwise tests were carried out to investigate the interaction of each mutant protein with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
All three mutations had a clear effect on the interactions .
The most subtle mutation ( Q422R ) caused a reduction in the interaction with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
The C-terminal extension mutations X423L and1615del10 mutations both dramatically reduced or abolished the interaction with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
None of the three mutations affected the interaction with <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> which again is consistent with the hypothesis that <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> interacts with a more N-terminal part of the PST domain .
On the basis of secondary structure predictions and amino acid sequence conservation , we defined a novel <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein domain , which we have called the C-terminal peptide .
We performed yeast two-hybrid library screens with the C-terminal peptide and the whole PST domain and we identified three novel interacting proteins , <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
In library screens , <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> interacted with the C-terminal peptide and the PST domain while <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> interacted only with the PST domain , suggesting that <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> specifically interact with the C-terminal peptide while <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> interacts with a more N-terminal part of the PST domain .
The interactions between the PST domain and <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> were confirmed in pairwise tests .
We were not able to confirm the interaction between <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> or <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> with the C-terminal peptide construct in pairwise tests , but we showed that the C-terminal peptide was important for <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> / <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> or <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> / <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> interaction because <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> did not interact with a PST domain construct lacking the C-terminal peptide .
HOMER3 is found in the PSD of neurons and directly binds to type I metabotropic glutamate receptors , which act via phospholipase C to stimulate IP3-mediated release of Ca2 + from intracellular vesicles [ 35,39 ] .
HOMER3 is a member of the HOMER family of proteins that are constitutively expressed in the brain and play a role in post-synaptic signalling and receptor trafficking by forming multivalent links with various receptors and PSD scaffolding proteins [ 35,39-41 ] .
HOMER proteins have also been implicated in axon guidance during brain development [ 42 ] .
DNCL1 is a subunit of two intracellular transport protein complexes , dynein and myosin Va [ 36 ] .
Dynein and myosin Va are involved in the microtubule-based and actin-based movement respectively of proteins , organelles and vesicles in neurons [ 36,37 ] .
Myosin Va is enriched in the PSD [ 43 ] , and DNCL1 binds to a variety of PSD proteins including guanylate kinase domain-associated protein [ 44 ] and neuronal nitric oxide synthase [ 45 ] .
<termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> is a member of the mouse tripartite motif protein family ( also known as the RBCC family ) , and contains the three characteristic structural motifs of this protein family , a RING finger , a B-box zinc finger , and a coiled coil domain , as well as a B30 .2 domain that is found in many but not all TRIM proteins [ 38 ] .
TRIM11 interacts with <termsem="EG:4550"> Humanin </term> , a protein that suppresses the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer 's disease [ 46 ] .
TRIM11 lowers <termsem="EG:4550"> Humanin </term> levels by a mechanism that appears to involve ubiqutin-mediated proteasomal degradation [ 46 ] .
At present our data must be considered preliminary because the interactions have not been confirmed by any other approach .
However it is interesting to speculate that the interaction of <termsem="EG:18508"> PAX6 </term> with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> may be the basis of a mechanism by which synaptic signalling causes changes in gene expression .
We propose that <termsem="EG:18508"> PAX6 </term> is sequestered in the PSD by binding to <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> .
Since receptor activation causes dissociation of HOMER proteins [ 35 ] , <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> may be released as a result of synaptic activity , allowing it to interact with <termsem="EG:8655"> DNCL1 </term> .
The <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> / <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> complex could then participate in myosin Va-mediated transport along the PSD-associated actin cytoskeleton followed by dynein-mediated transport along the microtubule network , eventually reaching the nucleus [ 36 ] .
Since TRIM11 is implicated in protein degradation [ 46 ] , it may play a role in <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein turnover .
Precedents for association of transcription factors with the post-synaptic density include STAT3 and CREB , which act as messengers between the synapse and the nucleus [ 47,48 ] .
Although the full-length PAX6 protein is predominantly nuclear , there is good evidence in mouse , quail and nematode for an isoform that lacks the paired domain , is both nuclear and cytoplasmic , and binds DNA through the homeodomain alone [ 49-51 ] .
In mice the paired-less isoform is relatively abundant in brain [ 49 ] ; however its subcellular localisation in neurones , and the possibility of an association with the PSD , remains to be investigated .
Regarding the subcellular localisation of the putative interacting proteins , HOMER3 is predominantly found at the interface between the PSD and the cytoplasm [ 39 ] , DNCL1 is chiefly cytoplasmic , although nuclear localisation has been reported [ 51 ] , and TRIM11 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic [ 38 ] .
Therefore cytoplasmic <termsem="EG:18508"> PAX6 </term> could potentially interact with all three proteins , while nuclear <termsem="EG:18508"> PAX6 </term> could interact with <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> and <termsem="EG:8655"> DNCL1 </term> .
At the tissue level , HOMER3 expression has been detected in thymus and lung but it has mainly been studied in brain where it is found in the forebrain , hippocampus and cerebellum [ 39 ] .
DNCL1 and TRIM11 both have wide expression domains that include the brain [ 44,38 ] .
Thus the expression of all three interactors overlaps with PAX6 at the tissue level [ 2,7,8,10 ] .
We detected co-expression of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> , <termsem="EG:9454"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:8655"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:81559"> TRIM11 </term> by RT-PCR in human adult brain RNA ( IH , L Harrison and A Brown , data not shown ) .
We demonstrated that the interaction between the PST domain and <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> or <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> was impaired by three naturally occurring mutations that are located in the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> C-terminal peptide .
The Q422R mutation , which involves a glutamine to arginine substitution at the last amino acid position of <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> , caused a reduction in the interaction with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> .
The X423L and 1615del10 mutations severely reduced or completely abolished the interaction with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> .
The predicted effect of the X423L and 1615del10 mutations is to cause translation into the 3 ' untranslated region , thus generating proteins with abnormal extensions that might be expected to disrupt the conformation of the C-terminal end of the protein .
The 1615del10 mutation also removes the last 5 amino acids of the C-terminal peptide [ 28 ] .
None of the mutations affected the interaction with <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> , suggesting that they do not alter the conformation of the more N-terminal part of the PST domain .
All our data are consistent with the hypothesis that <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> does not interact with the C-terminal peptide , but interacts with the PST domain between the homeodomain and the C-terminal peptide .
Most aniridia patients are heterozygous for mutations that introduce a premature termination codon into the <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> open reading frame [ 2,52 ] .
These alleles would be expected to encode truncated proteins or no protein at all if the mutant RNA is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay [ 52 ] .
We propose that the brain anomalies that have been observed in aniridia patients may be partly explained by impaired interaction between <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> and <termsem="EG:9454"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:8655"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:81559"> TRIM11 </term> .
The neurobehavioural phenotype associated with 1615del10 and the polymicrogyria associated with X423L may result from a specific effect of these unusual C-terminal extension mutations .
There is evidence that signalling and transport mechanisms that were initially characterized in the brain may also be conserved in the retina , suggesting that impaired <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein-protein interactions may also have implications for the retinal defects observed in individuals with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations [ 53,54 ] .
We have presented preliminary evidence that the neurodevelopmental transcriptional regulator <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> interacts with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> and <termsem="EG:94091"> TRIM11 </term> .
We suggest that the interaction of <termsem="EG:18508"> PAX6 </term> with <termsem="EG:26558"> HOMER3 </term> and <termsem="EG:56455"> DNCL1 </term> is a mechanism by which synaptic signalling could lead to regulated changes in gene expression in neurons .
We also propose that some of the neural anomalies in patients with <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> mutations may be explained by impaired protein-protein interactions .
Sequence database searches were carried out using the BLAST program available through the Bioinformatics Applications at the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research [ 24 ] .
Protein sequences that were highly homologous to the C-terminus of <termsem="EG:5080"> human PAX6 </term> were aligned using CLUSTAL [ 24 ] .
Secondary structure prediction was performed using the JPRED consensus method [ 25,26 ] .
All cDNA and amino acid numbering is based on the <termsem="EG:5080"> human PAX6 </term> cDNA and protein reference sequences available from the <termsem="EG:5080"> Human PAX6 </term> Allelic Variant Database web site [ 27 ] .
Standard PCR and subcloning techniques were used to make three <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> cDNA constructs in the pDBLeu expression vector ( ProQuest Two-Hybrid System , Invitrogen ) , which generates a protein fused to the <termsem="EG:855828"> yeast GAL4 </term> DNA binding domain .
PAX6PST contains the whole PST domain ( amino acids 278 -- 422 of the full-length <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> protein ) .
Primers were ST001 ( forward ) 5 ' - AAA AGT TCG ACT GCC AGC AAC ACA CCT AGT C-3 ' and ST005 ( R ) 5 ' - TTT TGC GGC TTT TTA CTG TAA TCT TGG CCA GTA TTG-3 ' .
PAX6CTP contains the newly defined C-terminal peptide alone ( 391 -- 422 ) .
Primers were ST004 ( F ) 5 ' - AAA AGT CGA CTA CCA CTT CAA CAG GAC TCA TT-3 ' and ST005 ( R ) .
PAX6PST-CT contains the PST domain minus the C-terminal peptide ( 278 -- 390 ) .
This was made by cutting PAX6PST with NdeI and NotI to drop out the C-terminal peptide , and inserting a synthetic linker between the two restriction sites .
All fragments generated by PCR or with linkers were sequenced to check that no errors had been introduced .
A <termsem="EG:5080"> PAX6 </term> PST domain construct containing the mutation 1627A > G ( Q422R ) was generated in the same way as the PAX6PST construct , but using the reverse PCR primer ST006 5 ' - TTT TGC GGC CGC TTT TTA CCG TAA TCT TGG CCA GTA TTG AG-3 ' , which contains the mutant nucleotide substitution ( underlined ) .
cDNA sequences containing the mutations 1615del10 [ 28 ] and 1629insT ( X423L ) [ 12 ] were generated by PCR from reverse transcribed RNA ( a gift from Dr K Williamson and Prof V van Heyningen ) .
Primers were ST015 ( F ) 5 ' - CCC ACA TAT GCA GAC ACA C-3 ' and ST031 ( R ) 5 ' - TTG CGG CCG CAT CCA TCC AGT CTA CAT TGT TC-3 ' .
The PAX6PST construct was cut with NdeI and NotI to release the normal C-terminal peptide , and the mutant sequence was inserted .
Yeast two-hybrid library screens .
A mouse brain cDNA library ( ProQuest , Invitrogen ) was screened with the PAX6PST and PAX6CTP pDBLeu constructs .
The library was constructed in the pPC86 vector , which produces proteins fused to the <termsem="EG:855828"> yeast GAL4 </term> activation domain .
The system uses three <termsem="EG:855828"> GAL4 </term> - activated reporter genes , HIS3 , URA3 and lacZ , to identify positive interactions .
Reporters are activated when the bait protein fused to the <termsem="EG:855828"> GAL4 </term> DNA binding domain ( pDBLeu ) interacts with the prey protein fused to the <termsem="EG:855828"> GAL4 </term> activation domain ( pPC86 ) , thus reconstituting <termsem="EG:855828"> GAL4 </term> function .
HIS3 activation allows growth on plates lacking histidine .
Weak URA3 activation suppresses growth on plates containing 5-fluro-orotic acid while strong URA3 activation permits growth on plates lacking uracil .
LacZ activation causes X-gal to turn blue in a beta-galactosidase assay .
All assays were carried out in parallel with the five ProQuest control yeast strains A-E , which range from non-interactor ( A ) to strong interactor ( E ) .
All procedures were carried out according to the supplier 's protocols .
Briefly , chemically competent MaV203 yeast cells were co-transformed with the cDNA library and the bait plasmid pDBLeu PAX6CTP or pDBLeu PAX6PST .
Transformants ( 5  107 ) were plated on medium lacking histidine to check for HIS3 activation .
HIS3 positives were then assayed for all 3 reporters .
The pPC86 prey plasmid was isolated from all HIS3/URA3/LacZ positives and the cDNA insert sequenced .
BLAST searches were performed to identify the cDNA insert [ 24 ] .
Specific interactions were tested by transforming competent MaV203 yeast cells with one bait construct ( in pDBLeu ) and one prey construct ( in pPC86 ) and testing the resulting colonies for activation of the HIS3 , URA3 and LacZ reporters as before .
To create a full-length <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> clone for pairwise tests , a cDNA clone ( IMAGE clone 3602414 , accession number BE569374 ) containing the missing N-terminal 70 amino acids was identified by a BLAST search of the EST nucleotide sequence database and obtained from the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research .
The missing fragment was amplified from the IMAGE clone by PCR and inserted into the pPC86 - <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> plasmid to create a full-length expression construct .
To check the relative representation of clones in the cDNA library , semi-quantitative PCR was performed on <termsem="EG:18508"> Pax6 </term> , <termsem="EG:26558"> Homer3 </term> , <termsem="EG:56455"> Dncl1 </term> , <termsem="EG:94091"> Trim11 </term> and the constitutively expressed genes <termsem="EG:14433"> Gapdh </term> and <termsem="EG:11946"> Atp5a1 </term> [ 29,30 ] .
Primers were designed to cross at least one intron , so that only correctly spliced clones were amplified .
