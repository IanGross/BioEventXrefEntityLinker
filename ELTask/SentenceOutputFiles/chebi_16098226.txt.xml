A screen for <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> that interact with PAX6 : <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal mutations disrupt interaction with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is a transcriptional regulator with a key role in ocular and neurological development .
Individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PAX6 gene have malformations of the eye and brain .
Little is known about the interactions of PAX6 with other <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , so we carried out a systematic screen for <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> that interact with PAX6 .
We used bioinformatics techniques to characterise a highly conserved peptide at the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminus of the PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> .
Yeast two-hybrid library screens were then carried out to identify brain-expressed <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> that interact with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide and with the entire PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:32874"> proline </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:32848"> serine </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:32835"> threonine </term> - rich domain .
Three novel PAX6-interacting <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> were identified : the post-synaptic density ( PSD ) <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> HOMER3 , the dynein subunit DNCL1 , and the tripartite motif <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> TRIM11 .
Three <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal PAX6 mutations , previously identified in patients with eye malformations , all reduced or abolished the interactions .
Our preliminary data suggest that PAX6 interacts with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
We propose that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 is a mechanism by which synaptic activation could lead to changes in neuronal transcriptional activity , and that some of the neural anomalies in patients with PAX6 mutations could be explained by impaired <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> interactions .
The PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is a member of the PAX ( paired-box ) family of transcriptional regulators and is essential for normal ocular and neural development [ 1 ] .
Heterozygous mutations of the human PAX6 gene cause aniridia ( absence of the iris ) and a range of other congenital eye malformations [ 2 ] .
Neural defects such as foveal hypoplasia and optic nerve hypoplasia are common in PAX6-associated eye disease [ 3-5 ] .
Homozygous mutations in man and mouse are lethal and result in severe developmental abnormalities including anophthalmia , severe reduction of the olfactory structures and gross brain malformations [ 2,6 ] .
The roles of PAX6 in brain development have mainly been studied in homozygous mutant mice or rats and include arealisation of the cerebral cortex [ 7 ] , formation of the prosencephalon-mesencephalon boundary [ 8 ] , axon guidance [ 8 ] , differentiation of neurons from glia [ 9 ] and neuronal migration in the cerebellum [ 10 ] .
The discovery of multiple and diverse roles for PAX6 in brain development prompted MRI analyses of aniridia patients , and a range of distinctive brain anomalies were uncovered .
The most common and striking of these was absence or hypoplasia of the anterior commissure [ 11 ] .
Other defects included absence or hypoplasia of the pineal gland , cortical polymicrogyria , white matter changes in the corpus callosum and grey matter changes in the cerebellum [ 11-13 ] .
Functional changes included hyposmia and abnormal inter-hemispheric auditory transfer [ 11,14 ] .
The defining feature of all PAX <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> is the presence of a 128 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> DNA-binding paired domain that has been highly conserved over evolution [ 1 ] .
In addition to the paired domain , PAX6 also contains a DNA-binding homeodomain and a <termsem="CHEBI:32874"> proline </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:32848"> serine </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:32835"> threonine </term> - rich ( PST ) domain at the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminus [ 1,6 ] .
The PST domain , which encompasses the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal 145 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> of PAX6 , has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator [ 6 ] .
The PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> directly regulates a wide range of target genes [ 1,2 ] including Pax2 [ 15 ] , Ngn2 [ 16 ] and glucagon [ 17 ] .
The Pax6 gene has a spatially and temporally complex expression pattern in the eye , brain , nasal structures , spinal cord and pancreas [ 1 ] .
Although PAX6 is clearly involved in multiple developmental processes , common themes are now emerging concerning the role of PAX6 in neural tissues .
Gradients of Pax6 expression are important for determining positional characteristics in the retina [ 18 ] and the neocortex [ 7 ] .
PAX6 plays a role in development of specific axonal connections between the retina and the brain [ 18 ] and within the forebrain [ 8,19 ] .
It is also involved in the differentiation of neural cell types from multipotent precursors in the retina [ 16 ] and the cerebral cortex [ 9 ] through activation of bHLH genes such as Ngn2 and Mash1 .
These studies provide a clear link between PAX6 function in the retina and the brain , and are of particular relevance to the neurological phenotypes of individuals with PAX6 mutations .
It is becoming apparent that transcription factors do not act in isolation but are dependent on interactions with other <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> to carry out their function [ 20,21 ] .
These interactions introduce more specificity into the regulatory function of a given transcription factor .
To date only three PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> interactions have been described : with SOX2 on the lens-specific enhancer element of the -crystallin gene [ 22 ] ; with MDIA , which modulates PAX6 activity in early neuronal development [ 23 ] , and with MAF <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> on the glucagon promoter , which causes increased expression of this pancreatic <termsem="CHEBI:24621"> hormone </term> gene [ 17 ] .
Here we report the preliminary results of the first systematic screen for <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> that interact with PAX6 .
We used sequence alignment algorithms and secondary structure prediction programs to define a new domain of 32 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> at the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal end of the PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> .
We then screened a brain library with this peptide using the yeast two-hybrid technique and identified three novel interacting <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The interaction between PAX6 and these <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> was disrupted by naturally occurring <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal PAX6 mutations .
A highly conserved <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal PAX6 peptide .
We and others [ 31-33 ] noted that there is significant sequence conservation at the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal end of the PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> .
BLAST analysis of the <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> sequence of the PAX6 PST domain ( <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> aa </term> 278 -- 422 ) revealed a highly conserved motif within the last 28 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> ( beginning at the ` GLISP ' motif , Figure 1a ) .
Strong conservation was seen in distantly related species such as axolotl ( Ambystoma mexicanum ) and sea urchin ( Paracentrotus lividus ) ( Figure 1a ) .

( b ) Secondary structure analysis of the highly conserved terminal 28 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> predicts a single beta sheet ( arrow ) in the SVPVQ peptide .
( c ) When 4 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> residues </term> are added in the <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal direction , 2 beta sheets are now predicted .
We subjected the whole PAX6 PST domain to secondary structure analysis using JPRED , a program that uses a number of different <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> structure prediction algorithms to generate a consensus secondary structure ( Figure 1 ) [ 25,26 ] .
The PST domain was largely devoid of predicted secondary structure except for the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal region , which contained two predicted beta sheets within the highly conserved domain , one in the ` GLISP ' motif and one in the ` SPVPQ ' motif ( identical to the pattern shown in Figure 1c ) .
Initially we defined the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal domain as running from the ` GLISP ' motif up to the stop codon , since this region was most highly conserved and contained strongly predicted secondary structure elements .
However when we performed secondary structure prediction analysis on this 28 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> peptide , the first beta sheet was lost ( Figure 1b ) .
Addition of another 4 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> ( TTST ) immediately before ` GLISP ' caused recovery of the first beta sheet ( Figure 1c ) .
Although these 4 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> residues </term> are not highly conserved ( Figure 1a ) , they appear to be important for seeding the first beta sheet and therefore for secondary structure .
Thus we define the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide as being the final 32 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> of PAX6 , running from <termsem="CHEBI:32835"> threonine </term> 391 to the stop codon ( top line of Figure 1c ) .
We hypothesised that the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide might be involved in <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> interactions , and we tested this by screening a cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system with a construct ( PAX6CTP ) in which the 32 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide was fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain .
We chose to screen a mouse brain cDNA library as no human libraries were available .
Given the fact that the <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> sequence of the PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is identical in man and mouse , we reasoned that a mouse brain library would yield relevant interactors .
For comparison we also carried out the screen using a construct containing the whole PST domain ( PAX6PST ) .
The <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide screen gave 15 colonies that were positive with all three reporters and the PST domain screen gave 62 colonies .
The interacting plasmids were isolated and the cDNA inserts sequenced .
Three cDNAs were identified 3 or more times , Homer3 ( NM_011984 ) , Dncl1 ( Dynein cytoplasmic light chain 1 , NM_019682 , also known as Pin or Dlc8 ) and Trim11 ( Tripartite motif <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> family member 11 , NM_053168 ) .
Homer3 ( 6 clones ) and Dncl1 ( 2 clones ) were identified in the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide screen .
Homer3 ( 7 clones ) , Dncl1 ( 2 clones ) and Trim11 ( 6 clones ) were identified in the PST domain screen .
All cDNA inserts were in-frame with the coding region of the pPC86 GAL4 activation domain .
None of the cDNAs was present in a list of known false positives [ 34 ] .
HOMER3 is a member of the HOMER family of neuronal post-synaptic density ( PSD ) <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> [ 35 ] .
DNCL1 is a subunit of two motor <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> complexes , dynein and myosin-Va , both of which are involved in intracellular trafficking of <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> and organelles in neurons [ 36,37 ] .
TRIM11 is a member of the tripartite motif <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> family and contains a RING finger , a B-box <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> finger , a coiled coil domain and a B30 .2 domain [ 38 ] .
The possible significance of the interactions between these <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> and PAX6 is discussed below .
To check that the Homer3 , Dncl1 and Trim11 clones were not identified multiple times solely because they are highly abundant in the library , we performed a semi-quantitative PCR assay .
We compared the relative abundance of Homer3 , Dncl1 , Trim11 and Pax6 with Gapdh and Atp5a1 .
Gapdh and Atp5a1 both show strong constitutive expression in a variety of tissues including the brain [ 29,30 ] .
Homer3 , Dncl1 , Trim11 and Pax6 were only amplified strongly after 35 cycles of PCR ( Figure 2 ) and were therefore present at relatively low levels compared to Gapdh ( amplified strongly after 25 cycles ) and Atp5a1 ( amplified strongly after 30 cycles ; Figure 2 ) .
Semi-quantitative PCR analysis of Homer3 , Dncl1 , Trim11 and Pax6 in the mouse brain cDNA library .
Library cDNA was amplified with primers specific for Pax6 ( 600 bp ) , Homer3 ( 485 bp band ) , Dncl1 ( 485 bp ) and Trim11 ( 609 bp ) for 20 , 25 , 30 or 35 cycles .
Atp5a1 ( 415 bp ) and Gapdh ( 450 bp ) , which are highly expressed in the brain , are included for comparison .
M indicates the   174 HaeIII DNA size marker ; the positions of the 603 bp and 310 bp marker bands are indicated .
We concluded that Homer3 , Dncl1 and Trim11 clones were not highly abundant in the library .
This is consistent with the idea that they were pulled out because the encoded <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> interact specifically with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide or PST domain of PAX6 .
Yeast two-hybrid pairwise interactions .
By library screening we identified two <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> ( HOMER3 and DNCL1 ) that interact with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide and three <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> ( HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 ) that interact with the whole PST domain .
This suggests that HOMER3 and DNCL1 interact specifically with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide while TRIM11 interacts with a more <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal part of the PST domain .
We conducted pairwise tests between specific constructs to confirm the interactions identified in the library screen and to further investigate the interaction between PAX6 and HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The Dncl1 and Trim11 clones that were pulled out of the library were full-length , but the Homer3 cDNAs lacked the <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal 70 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> .
The missing coding region was inserted into the truncated Homer3 cDNA to give a full-length expression construct ( see Methods ) .
Pairwise interactions were carried out with both the full-length and truncated Homer3 clones .
We confirmed that the whole PAX6 PST domain interacts with HOMER3 ( full-length and truncated constructs ) , TRIM11 and DNCL1 , as all three reporter genes were strongly activated in pairwise tests ( Figure 3 ; Table 1 ) .
In contrast the interaction between the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide and HOMER3 or DNCL1 could not be confirmed with pairwise tests ( Table 1 ) .
Occasionally , partial suppression of growth on plates containing 5 - <termsem="CHEBI:42645"> fluoro </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:16742"> orotic acid </term> was observed , indicating low-level activation of the URA3 reporter ; however HIS3 and LacZ activation were not observed .
The reasons for this are not clear , although it may be that the pairwise tests were of sub-optimal sensitivity compared to the library screen .
However we were able to confirm that the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide is important for the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 because interaction with the PAX6PST-CT construct , which lacks the final 32 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> , was completely abolished ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
TRIM11 interacted equally well with PAX6PST and PAX6PST-CT ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
This is consistent with the library screens in which TRIM11 was isolated with the PST domain but not with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide and supports the idea that the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide is not important for the interaction between PAX6 and TRIM11 .

Having confirmed that HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 interact with the PAX6 PST domain , we next investigated how the interactions were affected by three <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal PAX6 mutations that have been previously described in patients with ocular anomalies .
The first mutation is a single nucleotide substitution 1627A > <termsem="CHEBI:30755"> G </term> that causes a <termsem="CHEBI:28300"> glutamine </term> to <termsem="CHEBI:32700"> <termsem="CHEBI:29016"> arginine </term> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> substitution in the last codon of PAX6 .
This missense mutation ( Q422R ) has been reported in two patients , one affected by anterior segment dysgenesis with uveal ectropion and one with typical aniridia and foveal hypoplasia [ 27,33 ] .
The second mutation ( 1615del10 ) was found in an aniridia family [ 28 ] .
This frame-shifting deletion occurs just before the PAX6 stop codon and is predicted to cause translational read-through into the 3 ' untranslated region , generating a <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> in which the last 5 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> of the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide are replaced by a 103 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> - extension .
Affected individuals in this family showed unusual neurobehavioural traits including impaired social cognition and poor verbal inhibition [ 28 ] .
MRI analysis revealed grey matter abnormalities in the frontal lobe , temporal lobe and cerebellum , and white matter deficits in the corpus callosum [ 13 ] .
The third mutation 1629insT ( X423L ) has been reported in several aniridia patients [ 11,12,27,33 ] .
Insertion of a single <termsem="CHEBI:30757"> T </term> nucleotide at position 1629 changes the stop codon ( TAA ) to a <termsem="CHEBI:32630"> leucine </term> codon ( TTA ) and generates a full length PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> with a <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal extension that extends for a further 35 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> into the 3 ' untranslated region .
MRI analysis of six patients with this mutation revealed variable brain defects including absence or hypoplasia of the anterior commissure , pineal gland and olfactory bulbs [ 12 ] .
Two patients had temporal polymicrogyria , one in association with epilepsy [ 12 ] .
The three mutations were introduced into the PAX6PST construct , and pairwise tests were carried out to investigate the interaction of each mutant <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
All three mutations had a clear effect on the interactions .
The most subtle mutation ( Q422R ) caused a reduction in the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
The <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal extension mutations X423L and1615del10 mutations both dramatically reduced or abolished the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 ( Figure 3 , Table 1 ) .
None of the three mutations affected the interaction with TRIM11 which again is consistent with the hypothesis that TRIM11 interacts with a more <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal part of the PST domain .
On the basis of secondary structure predictions and <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> sequence conservation , we defined a novel PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> domain , which we have called the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide .
We performed yeast two-hybrid library screens with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide and the whole PST domain and we identified three novel interacting <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
In library screens , HOMER3 and DNCL1 interacted with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide and the PST domain while TRIM11 interacted only with the PST domain , suggesting that HOMER3 and DNCL1 specifically interact with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide while TRIM11 interacts with a more <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal part of the PST domain .
The interactions between the PST domain and HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 were confirmed in pairwise tests .
We were not able to confirm the interaction between HOMER3 or DNCL1 with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide construct in pairwise tests , but we showed that the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide was important for PAX6/HOMER3 or PAX6/DNCL1 interaction because HOMER3 and DNCL1 did not interact with a PST domain construct lacking the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide .
HOMER3 is found in the PSD of neurons and directly binds to type I metabotropic <termsem="CHEBI:14321"> <termsem="CHEBI:29987"> glutamate </term> </term> receptors , which act via phospholipase C to stimulate IP3-mediated release of <termsem="CHEBI:29108"> Ca2 + </term> from intracellular vesicles [ 35,39 ] .
HOMER3 is a member of the HOMER family of <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> that are constitutively expressed in the brain and play a role in post-synaptic signalling and receptor trafficking by forming multivalent links with various receptors and PSD scaffolding <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> [ 35,39-41 ] .
HOMER <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> have also been implicated in axon guidance during brain development [ 42 ] .
DNCL1 is a subunit of two intracellular transport <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> complexes , dynein and myosin Va [ 36 ] .
Dynein and myosin Va are involved in the microtubule-based and actin-based movement respectively of <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , organelles and vesicles in neurons [ 36,37 ] .
Myosin Va is enriched in the PSD [ 43 ] , and DNCL1 binds to a variety of PSD <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> including <termsem="CHEBI:17345"> guanylate </term> kinase domain-associated <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> [ 44 ] and neuronal <termsem="CHEBI:16480"> <termsem="CHEBI:25555"> nitric </term> oxide </term> synthase [ 45 ] .
TRIM11 is a member of the mouse tripartite motif <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> family ( also known as the RBCC family ) , and contains the three characteristic structural motifs of this <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> family , a RING finger , a B-box <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> finger , and a coiled coil domain , as well as a B30 .2 domain that is found in many but not all TRIM <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> [ 38 ] .
TRIM11 interacts with Humanin , a <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> that suppresses the neurotoxicity associated with Alzheimer 's disease [ 46 ] .
TRIM11 lowers Humanin levels by a mechanism that appears to involve ubiqutin-mediated proteasomal degradation [ 46 ] .
At present our data must be considered preliminary because the interactions have not been confirmed by any other approach .
However it is interesting to speculate that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 may be the basis of a mechanism by which synaptic signalling causes changes in gene expression .
We propose that PAX6 is sequestered in the PSD by binding to HOMER3 .
Since receptor activation causes dissociation of HOMER <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> [ 35 ] , PAX6 may be released as a result of synaptic activity , allowing it to interact with DNCL1 .
The PAX6/DNCL1 complex could then participate in myosin Va-mediated transport along the PSD-associated actin cytoskeleton followed by dynein-mediated transport along the microtubule network , eventually reaching the nucleus [ 36 ] .
Since TRIM11 is implicated in <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> degradation [ 46 ] , it may play a role in PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> turnover .
Precedents for association of transcription factors with the post-synaptic density include STAT3 and CREB , which act as <termsem="CHEBI:33280"> messengers </term> between the synapse and the nucleus [ 47,48 ] .
Although the full-length PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is predominantly nuclear , there is good evidence in mouse , quail and nematode for an isoform that lacks the paired domain , is both nuclear and cytoplasmic , and binds DNA through the homeodomain alone [ 49-51 ] .
In mice the paired-less isoform is relatively abundant in brain [ 49 ] ; however its subcellular localisation in neurones , and the possibility of an association with the PSD , remains to be investigated .
Regarding the subcellular localisation of the putative interacting <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , HOMER3 is predominantly found at the interface between the PSD and the cytoplasm [ 39 ] , DNCL1 is chiefly cytoplasmic , although nuclear localisation has been reported [ 51 ] , and TRIM11 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic [ 38 ] .
Therefore cytoplasmic PAX6 could potentially interact with all three <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , while nuclear PAX6 could interact with TRIM11 and DNCL1 .
At the tissue level , HOMER3 expression has been detected in thymus and lung but it has mainly been studied in brain where it is found in the forebrain , hippocampus and cerebellum [ 39 ] .
DNCL1 and TRIM11 both have wide expression domains that include the brain [ 44,38 ] .
Thus the expression of all three interactors overlaps with PAX6 at the tissue level [ 2,7,8,10 ] .
We detected co-expression of PAX6 , HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 by RT-PCR in human adult brain RNA ( IH , L Harrison and A Brown , data not shown ) .
We demonstrated that the interaction between the PST domain and HOMER3 or DNCL1 was impaired by three naturally occurring mutations that are located in the PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide .
The Q422R mutation , which involves a <termsem="CHEBI:32677"> glutamine </term> to <termsem="CHEBI:32700"> arginine </term> substitution at the <termsem="CHEBI:33711"> last <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> position of PAX6 , caused a reduction in the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 .
The X423L and 1615del10 mutations severely reduced or completely abolished the interaction with HOMER3 and DNCL1 .
The predicted effect of the X423L and 1615del10 mutations is to cause translation into the 3 ' untranslated region , thus generating <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> with abnormal extensions that might be expected to disrupt the conformation of the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal end of the <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> .
The 1615del10 mutation also removes the last 5 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> of the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide [ 28 ] .
None of the mutations affected the interaction with TRIM11 , suggesting that they do not alter the conformation of the more <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal part of the PST domain .
All our data are consistent with the hypothesis that TRIM11 does not interact with the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide , but interacts with the PST domain between the homeodomain and the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide .
Most aniridia patients are heterozygous for mutations that introduce a premature termination codon into the PAX6 open reading frame [ 2,52 ] .
These alleles would be expected to encode truncated <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> or no <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> at all if the mutant RNA is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay [ 52 ] .
We propose that the brain anomalies that have been observed in aniridia patients may be partly explained by impaired interaction between PAX6 and HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
The neurobehavioural phenotype associated with 1615del10 and the polymicrogyria associated with X423L may result from a specific effect of these unusual <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal extension mutations .
There is evidence that signalling and transport mechanisms that were initially characterized in the brain may also be conserved in the retina , suggesting that impaired PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> interactions may also have implications for the retinal defects observed in individuals with PAX6 mutations [ 53,54 ] .
We have presented preliminary evidence that the neurodevelopmental transcriptional regulator PAX6 interacts with HOMER3 , DNCL1 and TRIM11 .
We suggest that the interaction of PAX6 with HOMER3 and DNCL1 is a mechanism by which synaptic signalling could lead to regulated changes in gene expression in neurons .
We also propose that some of the neural anomalies in patients with PAX6 mutations may be explained by impaired <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> interactions .
Sequence database searches were carried out using the BLAST program available through the Bioinformatics Applications at the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research [ 24 ] .
<termsem="CHEBI:36080"> Protein </term> sequences that were highly homologous to the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminus of human PAX6 were aligned using CLUSTAL [ 24 ] .
Secondary structure prediction was performed using the JPRED consensus method [ 25,26 ] .
All cDNA and <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> numbering is based on the human PAX6 cDNA and <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> reference sequences available from the Human PAX6 Allelic Variant Database web site [ 27 ] .
Standard PCR and subcloning techniques were used to make three PAX6 cDNA constructs in the pDBLeu expression vector ( ProQuest Two-Hybrid System , Invitrogen ) , which generates a <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain .
PAX6PST contains the whole PST domain ( <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> 278 -- 422 of the full-length PAX6 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> ) .
Primers were ST001 ( forward ) 5 ' - AAA AGT TCG ACT GCC AGC AAC ACA CCT AGT <termsem="CHEBI:30758"> C </term> -3 ' and ST005 ( R ) 5 ' - TTT TGC GGC TTT TTA CTG TAA TCT TGG CCA GTA TTG-3 ' .
PAX6CTP contains the newly defined <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide alone ( 391 -- 422 ) .
Primers were ST004 ( F ) 5 ' - AAA AGT CGA CTA CCA CTT CAA CAG GAC TCA TT-3 ' and ST005 ( R ) .
PAX6PST-CT contains the PST domain minus the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide ( 278 -- 390 ) .
This was made by cutting PAX6PST with NdeI and NotI to drop out the <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide , and inserting a synthetic linker between the two restriction sites .
All fragments generated by PCR or with linkers were sequenced to check that no errors had been introduced .
A PAX6 PST domain construct containing the mutation 1627A > <termsem="CHEBI:30755"> G </term> ( Q422R ) was generated in the same way as the PAX6PST construct , but using the reverse PCR primer ST006 5 ' - TTT TGC GGC CGC TTT TTA CCG TAA TCT TGG CCA GTA TTG AG-3 ' , which contains the mutant nucleotide substitution ( underlined ) .
cDNA sequences containing the mutations 1615del10 [ 28 ] and 1629insT ( X423L ) [ 12 ] were generated by PCR from reverse transcribed RNA ( a gift from Dr K Williamson and Prof V van Heyningen ) .
Primers were ST015 ( F ) 5 ' - CCC ACA TAT GCA GAC ACA <termsem="CHEBI:30758"> C </term> -3 ' and ST031 ( R ) 5 ' - TTG CGG CCG CAT CCA TCC AGT CTA CAT TGT TC-3 ' .
The PAX6PST construct was cut with NdeI and NotI to release the normal <termsem="CHEBI:18245"> <termsem="CHEBI:46883"> C </term> </term> - terminal peptide , and the mutant sequence was inserted .
Yeast two-hybrid library screens .
A mouse brain cDNA library ( ProQuest , Invitrogen ) was screened with the PAX6PST and PAX6CTP pDBLeu constructs .
The library was constructed in the pPC86 vector , which produces <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> fused to the yeast GAL4 activation domain .
The system uses three GAL4-activated reporter genes , HIS3 , URA3 and lacZ , to identify positive interactions .
Reporters are activated when the bait <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( pDBLeu ) interacts with the prey <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> fused to the GAL4 activation domain ( pPC86 ) , thus reconstituting GAL4 function .
HIS3 activation allows growth on plates lacking <termsem="CHEBI:27570"> histidine </term> .
Weak URA3 activation suppresses growth on plates containing 5 - <termsem="CHEBI:42645"> fluro </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:16742"> orotic acid </term> while strong URA3 activation permits growth on plates lacking <termsem="CHEBI:17568"> uracil </term> .
LacZ activation causes X-gal to turn blue in a beta-galactosidase assay .
All assays were carried out in parallel with the five ProQuest control yeast strains A-E , which range from non-interactor ( A ) to strong interactor ( E ) .
All procedures were carried out according to the supplier 's protocols .
Briefly , <termsem="CHEBI:23367"> chemically </term> competent MaV203 yeast cells were co-transformed with the cDNA library and the bait plasmid pDBLeu PAX6CTP or pDBLeu PAX6PST .
Transformants ( 5  107 ) were plated on medium lacking <termsem="CHEBI:27570"> histidine </term> to check for HIS3 activation .
HIS3 positives were then assayed for all 3 reporters .
The pPC86 prey plasmid was isolated from all HIS3/URA3/LacZ positives and the cDNA insert sequenced .
BLAST searches were performed to identify the cDNA insert [ 24 ] .
Specific interactions were tested by transforming competent MaV203 yeast cells with one bait construct ( in pDBLeu ) and one prey construct ( in pPC86 ) and testing the resulting colonies for activation of the HIS3 , URA3 and LacZ reporters as before .
To create a full-length Homer3 clone for pairwise tests , a cDNA clone ( IMAGE clone 3602414 , accession number BE569374 ) containing the missing <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminal 70 <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acids </term> </term> was identified by a BLAST search of the EST nucleotide sequence database and obtained from the Rosalind Franklin Centre for Genomics Research .
The missing fragment was amplified from the IMAGE clone by PCR and inserted into the pPC86-Homer3 plasmid to create a full-length expression construct .
To check the relative representation of clones in the cDNA library , semi-quantitative PCR was performed on Pax6 , Homer3 , Dncl1 , Trim11 and the constitutively expressed genes Gapdh and Atp5a1 [ 29,30 ] .
Primers were designed to cross at least one intron , so that only correctly spliced clones were amplified .
