Membrane <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> and mitochondrial abnormalities precede subunit c deposition in a cerebellar cell model of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis .
JNCL is a recessively inherited , childhood-onset neurodegenerative disease most-commonly caused by a ~ 1 kb CLN3 mutation .
The resulting loss of battenin activity leads to deposition of mitochondrial ATP synthase , subunit c and a specific loss of CNS neurons .
We previously <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice , which <termsem="GO:0006260"> replicate </term> the common JNCL mutation , <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> mutant battenin and display JNCL-like pathology .
To elucidate the consequences of the common JNCL mutation in neuronal cells , we used P4 knock-in mouse cerebella to <termsem="GO:0032502"> establish </term> conditionally immortalized CbCln3 wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous neuronal precursor cell lines , which can be <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiated </term> into MAP-2 and NeuN-positive , neuron-like cells .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> low levels of mutant battenin and , when <termsem="GO:0007568"> aged </term> at confluency , accumulate <termsem="GO:0016887"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ATPase </term> </term> subunit c. Recessive phenotypes are also observed at sub-confluent <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> ; <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> are altered , although enzyme activity is not significantly affected , lysosomal size and distribution are altered , and <termsem="GO:0006897"> endocytosis </term> is reduced .
In addition , mitochondria are abnormally elongated , cellular ATP levels are decreased , and survival following oxidative stress is reduced .
These findings reveal that battenin is required for intracellular membrane trafficking and mitochondrial function .
Moreover , these deficiencies are likely to be early events in the JNCL disease process and may particularly impact neuronal survival .
Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( JNCL ) , or Batten disease , is a recessively inherited childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive blindness , seizures , <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> and <termsem="GO:0050890"> cognitive </term> decline , and early <termsem="GO:0016265"> death </term> [ 1 ] .
The primary genetic defect ( > 80 % disease chromosomes ) leading to JNCL is a 1.02 kb genomic DNA deletion in the CLN3 gene , which eliminates exons 7 and 8 and surrounding intronic DNA , predicting a non-functional protein product [ 2 ] .
The pathological hallmark of JNCL is autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin deposits within autolysosomes that are enriched in subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex [ 3-5 ] .
Remarkably , these deposits are not only found in CNS neurons but are also abundant in non-neuronal cells outside of the nervous system .
The relationship of subunit c deposits to the JNCL disease process , and the underlying reason for the neuronal specificity of the disease remain poorly understood .
The CLN3-encoded protein ( battenin , also called CLN3 or cln3 p ) is a highly conserved , ubiquitously <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> , multi-pass membrane protein [ 6 ] that <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> to the lysosome and other vesicular compartments [ 7-9 ] .
Battenin function remains to be elucidated , although studies of btn1 , the yeast CLN3 ortholog , have implicated battenin in lysosomal <termsem="GO:0006885"> pH homeostasis </term> and <termsem="GO:0006865"> amino acid transport </term> [ 10,11 ] .
To explore JNCL pathogenesis and battenin function , we previously <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> a genetically precise JNCL mouse model .
Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice harbor the ~ 1 kb common JNCL mutation and <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> a non-truncated mutant battenin isoform that is detectable with antibodies recognizing C-terminal epitopes .
Homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice exhibit a progressive JNCL-like disease , with perinatal onset of subunit c deposition in many cell types and later onset of neuronal dysfunction and <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavioral </term> deficits [ 12 ] .
These findings suggest that the major JNCL defect leads to abnormal turnover of mitochondrial subunit c , in a manner that selectively compromises CNS neurons .
Currently , there is no suitable neuronal cell system to investigate the impact of the common JNCL mutation on <termsem="GO:0008150"> biological processes </term> .
Therefore , we have <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> cerebellar neuronal precursor cell lines from Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells exhibit pathological hallmarks of the disease , and a survey of membrane organelles revealed membrane <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> defects and mitochondrial dysfunction in homozygous mutant CbCln3ex7/8 cells .
<termsem="GO:0032502"> Generation </term> of a genetically precise cerebellar JNCL cell model .
To <termsem="GO:0032502"> generate </term> a precise genetic , neuron-derived JNCL cell culture system , we immortalized granule neurons cultured from postnatal day 4 ( P4 ) cerebella of homozygous and heterozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice , and wild-type littermates .
Primary cell cultures enriched for granule neurons were <termsem="GO:0009293"> transduced </term> with retroviral vector bearing a selection cassette and temperature-sensitive tsA58 SV40 large T antigen .
<termsem="GO:0040007"> Growth </term> in G418 containing medium at the permissive temperature ( 33 C ) allowed for selection and isolation of multiple clonal nestin-positive ( Fig. 1a ) , and GFAP-negative ( Fig. 1b ) , cell lines for each genotype .
No genotype specific differences were observed in cellular morphology or doubling time ( ~ 46 hours ) ( data not shown ) .
As expected , SV40 large T antigen <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was rapidly lost and <termsem="GO:0051301"> cell division </term> ceased when cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature ( 39 C ) ( data not shown ) .
Upon addition of neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> cocktail , precursor cells became neuron-like in morphology and exhibited decreased nestin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( data not shown ) and increased MAP2 and NeuN <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Fig. 1c ,1 d ) , but not <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the Purkinje marker , calbindin ( Fig. 1e ) .

CbCln3 + / + precursors exhibit nestin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( a ) but not GFAP <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( b ) , consistent with a neuronal precursor identity .
Upon <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulation </term> with a <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> cocktail ( see Methods ) , CbCln3 + / + cells achieved neuron-like morphology , with rounded cell bodies and extension of processes , and MAP2 ( c ) and NeuN ( d ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was increased .
CbCln3 + / + cells are negative for the Purkinje neuron marker calbindin ( e ) .

Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> mutant battenin and display JNCL-like pathology .
Homozygous Cb Cln3ex7/8 cells were first examined for JNCL-like characteristics .
Homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in mice <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> multiple Cln3 <termsem="GO:0000398"> mRNA splice </term> variants and mutant battenin protein that is detectable by batp1 antibody recognizing C-terminal epitopes [ 12 ] .
To assess this molecular phenotype in CbCln3ex7/8 cells , <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR and anti-battenin ( batp1 ) immunostaining were performed .
As shown in Figure 2 , Cln3 mRNA isoforms in wild-type and homozygous cells were similar to those observed in total RNA isolated from wild-type or homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in brain , respectively ( Fig. 2 ) .
In addition , batp1 immunostaining detected mutant battenin product in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , in a similar albeit reduced cytoplasmic , vesicular staining pattern as that seen in wild-type cells .
Batp1 signal exhibited some overlap with the lysosomal marker , Lamp1 , but had more significant overlap with early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ) and the late endosomal marker , Rab7 ( Fig. 3 ) .
Only limited overlap was observed with <termsem="GO:0032456"> recycling </term> endosomes , as determined by <termsem="GO:0004998"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transferrin receptor </term> </term> co-staining ( data not shown ) .
Intriguingly , Lamp1 and EEA1 immunocytochemical <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> were altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , with less perinuclear clustering than in wild-type cells , and Rab7 staining was frequently less intense in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( Fig. 3 ) .
Heterozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells contained a mixture of Cln3 mRNA products from both the wild-type allele and the mutant allele , and batp1 signal was similar to that seen in wild-type cells ( data not shown ) .

Battenin and lysosomal and endosomal marker co-staining in wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cerebellar precursor cells Batp1 immunostaining of wild-type ( CbCln3 + / + ) and homozygous mutant ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) cerebellar precursor cells is shown , with co-staining for lysosomes ( Lamp 1 ) , early endosomes ( EEA1 ) , and late endosomes ( Rab7 ) .
Significant overlap of Batp1 signal ( red ) with EEA1 ( green , middle panels ) and Rab7 ( green , bottom panels ) can be seen as yellow when the two channels are merged ( Merge ) .
The degree of Batp1 overlap is greatest with Rab7 .
Only limited overlap between Batp1 ( red ) and Lamp 1 ( green , top panels ) can be seen .
Batp1 signal in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells is significantly reduced , but significant overlap with EEA1 and Rab7 , and very little Lamp 1 overlap , can be seen as yellow in the respective merged panels .
Notably , Lamp 1 and EEA1 <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> appear altered , and Rab7 staining was frequently less intense in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells .
Wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 confocal images were captured with identical exposure settings .

During sub-confluent <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> conditions , neither wild-type nor homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells displayed autofluorescence or subunit c inclusion <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> ( data not shown ) .
However , when cells were <termsem="GO:0007568"> aged </term> at confluency ( 3 + days post-confluency ) , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cellular subunit c levels were elevated beyond normal wild-type levels by immunostaining ( Fig. 4a ) and immunoblot analysis ( Fig. 4b ) .
Autofluorescent signal sometimes overlapped with subunit c signal , but also was elevated more diffusely ( Fig. 4a ) .
Moreover , although multilamellar `` fingerprint '' profiles were not detected , confluency - <termsem="GO:0007568"> aged </term> homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells displayed numerous ultrastructural abnormalities including electron dense inclusions characteristic of lipofuscin and large autophagosomes that contained dense core structures , degenerating mitochondria , and many smaller vesicles ( Fig. 4c ) .
Inclusion bodies and autophagosomes were infrequently observed in confluency - <termsem="GO:0007568"> aged </term> wild-type cultures ( data not shown ) .

Wild-type cultures ( CbCln3 + / + ) exhibited limited subunit c immunostaining and autofluorescence .
However , CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 cells contained numerous subunit c puncta .
Autofluorescence ( 7 days AF ) was also significantly elevated ( right panels ) , although limited overlap with subunit c puncta was observed ( arrows ) .

b. Immunoblot analysis of subunit c protein at sub-confluency or 7-day confluency incubation is shown .
Total protein extracts from sub-confluency wild-type ( + / + ) and homozygous mutant ( ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) cultures contained approximately equal levels of subunit c protein ( -sub c ) .
7-day confluency extract from homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) had elevated levels of subunit c protein ( ~ 1.5 X ) , relative to wild-type extract ( + / + ) .
Protein levels were normalized to <termsem="GO:0004129"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cytochrome c oxidase </term> </term> subunit IV ( -cox4 ) .

We next investigated the basis for subunit c accumulation , testing the hypothesis that <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> is abnormal since it is required for ATP synthase subunit c <termsem="GO:0009056"> degradation </term> in the lysosome [ 13 ] .
We first tested <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells and Cln3ex7/8 mice using anti- <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> antibody that recognizes unprocessed and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processed </term> <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> isoforms .
Immunostaining of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells revealed a perinuclear and punctate vesicular <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> , consistent with its <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> through the <termsem="GO:0045045"> secretory pathway </term> and <termsem="GO:0006810"> delivery </term> to the lysosome ( Fig. 5a ) .
However , in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> was less vesicular and more perinuclear-clustered than in wild-type cells .
Immunoblots of homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cell and Cln3ex7/8 tissue extracts also showed altered relative levels of <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> isoforms ( Fig. 5b ) .
<termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Cathepsin D </term> </term> isoforms , identified by relative molecular weights , represent the ~ 45 kDa precursor , the ~ 43 kDa intermediate single chain form of the enzyme , and the 31 kDa heavy chain of the double-chain form of the mature enzyme [ 14 ] .
In homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cell and Cln3ex7/8 tissue extracts , the precursor and heavy chains were reduced , and the single chain was slightly elevated compared to wild-type extracts .
The <termsem="GO:0016049"> cellular growth </term> media did not contain altered levels of <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> , indicating enzyme <termsem="GO:0046903"> secretion </term> was not affected .
Heterozygous Cln3ex7/8 mice and CbCln3ex7/8 cells were indistinguishable from wild-type , as expected for a recessive disease phenotype ( data not shown ) .

CbCln3 + / + cells ( left panel ) exhibited a perinuclear and cytoplasmic punctate signal .
<termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Cathepsin D </term> </term> signal in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( right panel ) was more often perinuclear , with less cytoplasmic punctate signal , compared to wild-type CbCln3 + / + cells .

b.  - <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Cathepsin D </term> </term> - probed immunoblots of total wild-type versus homozygous Cln3ex7/8 knock-in tissue or CbCln3ex7/8 cellular extracts are shown .
The ~ 45 kDa <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> band , representing precursor , was the predominant band in wild-type ( wt ) tissue and cellular extracts , with lower levels of mature enzyme ( single chain , ~ 43 kDa , and heavy chain , ~ 31 kDa ) .
Conversely , homozygous Cln3ex7/8 and CbCln3ex7/8 mutant ( m ) extracts exhibited reduced levels of precursor and heavy chain of the double-chain form of the enzyme , with elevated levels of single-chain mature enzyme .
The impact of the altered <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> on enzymatic activity was next tested to determine if altered enzymatic activity accounts for inefficient subunit c turnover .
In a fluorogenic in vitro assay , <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> activity in total cellular extracts was not significantly altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( 376  89 RFU/g total protein ) , versus wild-type cells ( 324  58 RFU/g total protein ) , although a consistent trend towards increased enzymatic activity in mutant cells was observed .
Thus , <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> are disrupted in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells in a manner such that enzymatic activity appears to be relatively unaffected .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells show abnormal membrane organelles .
The abnormal <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> of <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> suggested membrane <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> disruptions in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ; therefore , we surveyed the subcellular distribution and morphology of membrane organelles .
Components of the <termsem="GO:0045045"> secretory pathway </term> , including the ER , cis-Golgi , and trans-Golgi , did not appear altered from wild-type appearance when labeled with the respective markers , <termsem="GO:0003756"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> protein disulfide isomerase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0003756"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> PDI </term> </term> ) , GM130 , and VVL ( data not shown ) .
By contrast , the lysosomal markers , Lysotracker and Lamp 2 had significantly altered signal in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , versus wild-type cells .
Wild-type cells exhibited brightly stained lysosomes that were large and clustered in the perinuclear region whereas homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 lysosomes were lightly stained , smaller vesicles that were more diffusely scattered in the cytoplasm of the cell ( Fig. 6 ) .
Lamp 1 <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> was also altered , as previously noted ( Fig. 3 ) .
However , Lamp 1 and Lamp 2 total protein levels were similar in wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells by immunoblot analysis , indicating the altered signal likely reflects dispersed lysosomes or altered <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> and/or epitope availability ( data not shown ) .
It is noteworthy that Lysotracker dye , which selectively accumulates in acidic compartments , exhibited the most marked reduction in lysosomal labeling .
This observation may reflect altered lysosomal pH , an established finding in JNCL [ 10,15 ] .
Lysotracker and Lamp 2 labeling of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 lysosomes Lysosomal labeling of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells with lysotracker and Lamp 2 antibody is shown .
Lysotracker dye ( top panels ) labeled large , perinuclear-clustered lysosomes and scattered lysosomes in the periphery of wild-type cells ( CbCln3 + / + ) .
Lysotracker stain was dramatically reduced in homozygous mutant cells ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) , with smaller labeled vesicles and less apparent perinuclear clustering .
Lamp 2 ( bottom panels ) immunostaining also showed reduced signal intensity with less perinuclear clustering in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , although the effect was somewhat less dramatic than that observed with Lysotracker dye .
Wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 confocal images were captured with identical exposure settings .

Consistent with the altered early endosome marker ( EEA1 ) signal observed by immunostaining ( Fig. 3 ) , <termsem="GO:0006907"> fluid-phase endocytosis </term> was also altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , as measured by dextran-FITC uptake ( Fig. 7 ) .
Following a 15-minute incubation in media containing dextran-FITC , wild-type and heterozygote cells displayed brightly stained , large <termsem="GO:0006897"> endocytic </term> vesicles that were clustered in the perinuclear region .
However , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells were less brightly stained with most dextran-FITC signal <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizing </term> to smaller vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm of the cell .
<termsem="GO:0006897"> Endocytosis </term> in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells Dextran-FITC uptake in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells is shown .
In wild-type ( CbCln3 + / + , left panel ) and heterozygous ( CbCln3 + / ex7/8 , middle panel ) cells , dextran-FITC label was observed in a perinuclear-clustered vesicular pattern with scattered labeled vesicles also present in the periphery .
In contrast , dextran-FITC label of homozygous mutant ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 , right panel ) cells was reduced overall and exhibited smaller stained vesicles with less perinuclear clustering .
Confocal images were captured with identical exposure settings .

Finally , because subunit c is a mitochondrial protein and its turnover proceeds through <termsem="GO:0000422"> autophagic engulfment of mitochondria </term> [ 13 ] , we analyzed homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cell mitochondrial morphology and function .
Mitochondrial distribution in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells was indistinguishable from wild-type and heterozygous cells ; however , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 mitochondria appeared more elongated by grp75 marker immunostaining and TEM analysis ( Fig. 8a ) .
72 % of homozygous mutant mitochondria were greater than 0.6 m in length ( range = 0.26 m to 2.75 m ) , while fewer wild-type mitochondria ( 51 % ) reached this length ( range = 0.15 m to 2.29 m ) .
Mitochondrial width was not altered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( data not shown ) .
Moreover , compared to wild-type or heterozygous cells , homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells had significantly reduced cellular ATP levels ( 1.3 fold less , Fig. 8b ) and exhibited reduced survival following hydrogen peroxide treatment ( ~ 50 % of wild-type survival , Fig. 8c ) , suggesting impaired energy <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolism </term> and <termsem="GO:0006979"> oxidative stress response </term> .
Taken together , these data support impaired mitochondrial function in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells .
Mitochondrial morphology and function in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells a. Confocal and TEM micrographs of wild-type and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 mitochondrial morphology are shown .
Immunostaining with the inner mitochondrial membrane marker , grp75 ( top panels ) highlighted elongated mitochondria in homozygous mutant cells ( CbCln3ex7/8/ex7 / 8 ) , relative to wild-type mitochondria ( CbCln3 + / + ) ( insets , zoom = 2.75 x ) .
<termsem="GO:0048311"> Mitochondrial distribution </term> was not altered from the wild-type pattern .
Elongated homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 mitochondria were also observed by TEM analysis .

b. Cellular ATP levels in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 precursor cells are shown .
Wild-type ( open bar ) and heterozygous ( gray bar ) CbCln3ex7/8 cells contained ~ 39 M ATP , while homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( black bar ) contained ~ 1.3 fold reduced levels of ATP ( ~ 30 M ) , which was statistically significant in a t-test ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Wild-type and heterozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cellular ATP levels were not statistically different from each other ( p > 0.4 ) .
A representative of triplicate experiments is shown ( n = 6 in each experiment ) .
c. Cell survival following 24-hour hydrogen peroxide treatment is shown .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells were ~ 2-fold more sensitive to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide treatment .
Wild-type ( circle ) and heterozygous ( triangle ) CbCln3ex7/8 cells exhibited ~ 50 % survival rates with 75 -- 100 M H2O2 , whereas homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells ( squares ) had a ~ 50 % survival rate with 50 M H2O2 .
A representative of triplicate experiments is shown ( n = 4 in each experiment ) .
CbCln3ex7/8 cerebellar precursor cells represent the first genetically accurate neuron-derived culture model of JNCL .
Homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> mutant battenin and JNCL-hallmark mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0016887"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> ATPase </term> </term> subunit c accumulation , upon <termsem="GO:0007569"> aging of cells </term> at confluency .
Moreover , this is the first study to indicate recessive endosomal/lysosomal membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction that precedes subunit c deposition in an accurate JNCL model .
Importantly , these defects are likely to be early events in the JNCL disease process and may particularly impact neuronal function .
Abnormal <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> and <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells and Cln3ex7/8 mice likely reflects altered <termsem="GO:0016192"> vesicular trafficking </term> and/or lysosomal pH , which is known to impact <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> [ 14,16 ] .
Indeed , CLN3 overexpression in HEK-293 cells altered lysosomal pH and <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0016485"> processing </term> [ 17 ] , and lysosomal <termsem="GO:0006885"> pH homeostasis </term> is disrupted in JNCL [ 10,15 ] .
It is noteworthy that <termsem="GO:0004213"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin B </term> </term> and the CLN2-encoded enzyme , TPPI , are also altered in JNCL [ 18-20 ] .
Nevertheless , despite the <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> protein alterations that are observed in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> enzymatic activity does not appear to be reduced .
Thus , decreased <termsem="GO:0004192"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> cathepsin D </term> </term> activity is unlikely to account for subunit c accumulation in JNCL .
Aging of homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells at confluency is necessary to induce significantly accumulated subunit c protein .
However , membrane organelle disruptions precede subunit c accumulation in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells , since they are observed without <termsem="GO:0007568"> aging </term> at confluency .
Lysosomal and endosomal size and distribution are altered , and mitochondria are abnormally elongated and functionally compromised in sub-confluent homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cultures .
These observations argue that membrane <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> defects do not result from excessive subunit c accumulation compromising the lysosome , but rather are early events in the disease process preceding subunit c accumulation .
Mitochondrial abnormalities , which have also been reported in JNCL patients and other animal models [ 21-23 ] , may result from ineffective turnover by <termsem="GO:0006914"> autophagy </term> , a lysosomal-targeted pathway [ 24 ] .
Alternatively , or simultaneously , battenin deficiency may impact mitochondrial function upstream of turnover , affecting mitochondrial <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> and/or altered transport and processing of mitochondrial proteins .
In wild-type CbCln3 neuronal precursor cells battenin primarily co - <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> with early and late endosomes .
Battenin immunostaining in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 neuronal precursors is significantly reduced in abundance , but mutant signal also co - <termsem="GO:0051179"> localizes </term> with endosomal markers suggesting mutant battenin protein with C-terminal epitopes is <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficked </term> similar to wild-type protein .
In other studies , CLN3/battenin <termsem="GO:0008104"> protein localization </term> has been reported to partially overlap with late endosomes and lysosomes in non-neuronal cells [ 7 ] , and to lysosomes , synaptosomes [ 8 ] and endosomes [ 9,25 ] in neurons .
These data jointly indicate that battenin <termsem="GO:0051179"> resides </term> in a subset of vesicular compartments linking multiple membrane <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking pathways </term> , perhaps functioning in <termsem="GO:0016192"> vesicular transport </term> and/or fusion .
Endocytic and lysosomal-targeted pathways , including <termsem="GO:0000422"> mitochondrial autophagy </term> , are specifically implicated in this study .
The membrane <termsem="GO:0006810"> trafficking </term> and mitochondrial deficits uncovered in homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cells are likely to particularly impact neuronal function .
<termsem="GO:0007268"> Neurotransmission </term> heavily relies on <termsem="GO:0016192"> membrane vesicle transport </term> , and a high-energy <termsem="GO:0008152"> metabolism </term> may further sensitize neurons to the loss of battenin activity .
Thus , our panel of wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous CbCln3ex7/8 cerebellar cells provide an ideal model system to further elucidate battenin function and JNCL pathogenesis .
