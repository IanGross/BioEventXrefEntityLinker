Rescue of Progeria in Trichothiodystrophy by Homozygous Lethal Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> Alleles </term> .
Although compound heterozygosity , or the presence of two different <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of the same <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , is common in human recessive disease , its potential to impact disease outcome has not been well documented .
This is most likely because of the inherent difficulty in distinguishing specific biallelic effects from differences in environment or <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background .
We addressed the potential of different recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to contribute to the enigmatic pleiotropy associated with XPD recessive disorders in compound heterozygous mouse models .
<termsem="SO:0001059"> Alterations </term> in this essential helicase , with functions in both <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair and basal transcription , result in diverse pathologies ranging from elevated UV sensitivity and cancer predisposition to accelerated segmental progeria .
We report a variety of biallelic effects on organismal phenotype attributable to combinations of recessive Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , including the following : ( i ) the ability of homozygous lethal Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to ameliorate a variety of disease symptoms when their essential basal transcription function is supplied by a different disease-causing <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , ( ii ) differential developmental and tissue-specific functions of distinct Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> products , and ( iii ) interallelic complementation , a phenomenon rarely reported at clinically relevant <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> in mammals .
Our data suggest a re-evaluation of the contribution of `` null '' <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to XPD disorders and highlight the potential of combinations of recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to affect both normal and pathological phenotypic plasticity in mammals .
Interallelic complementation is defined as the ability of two differentially <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to function better together than either can on its own .
Despite its near universality in lower organisms [ 1 ] , its potential to contribute to clinical heterogeneity in human disease is seldom considered .
Evidence of interallelic complementation at clinically relevant <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> is limited to biochemical and cell-based studies of a handful of metabolic disorders with defects in <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> including propinyl-CoA carboxylase [ 2 ] , argininosuccinate lyase [ 3 ] , galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase [ 4 ] , and methylmalonyl CoA mutase [ 5 ] .
Compound heterozygotes are individuals carrying two different <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of the same <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
In the absence of a dominant ( <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> [ <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> ] ) <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> interactions between recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> ( referred to here as `` biallelic '' effects ) could result in different phenotypic outcomes including interallelic complementation .
Although amelioration of disease symptoms by interallelic complementation would create an ascertainment bias in the clinic , the lack of evidence concerning interallelic complementation or other biallelic effects in human disease is likely caused by the difficulty in distinguishing such effects from environment and <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background .
XPD encodes one of the two helicase components of basal transcription / <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair factor IIH ( TFIIH ) , a ten-subunit , multifunctional complex that is essential for multiple processes , including basal transcription initiation and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage repair via the <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> repair ( NER ) pathway [ 6,7 ] .
<termsem="SO:0001059"> Alterations </term> in XPD resulting in defective TFIIH function are associated with UV-sensitive , multisystem disorders including xeroderma pigmentosum ( XP ) , XP combined with Cockayne syndrome ( CS ) , and trichothiodystrophy ( TTD ) [ 8 -- 10 ] .
XP is marked by sun-induced pigmentation anomalies and a greater than 1,000-fold elevation in skin cancer risk .
Severe cases can also present with growth retardation and primary neurodegeneration [ 11 ] .
CS and TTD , on the other hand , are segmental progeroid disorders characterised by progressive post-natal growth failure and primary demyelination resulting in severe neurodysfunction , but without a clear cancer predisposition [ 12 -- 15 ] .
Patients with TTD additionally display hallmark sulphur-deficient brittle hair and nails and scaling skin [ 13 ] , resulting from a basal transcription defect in specific cell types [ 16,17 ] .
A related disorder with the cancer predisposition of XP combined with the neurodevelopmental complications of CS ( XPCS ) , although rare , has also been described [ 18 ] .
Many XPD <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> are associated with an exclusive disease phenotype ( e.g. , XPDR722W with TTD and XPDR683W with XP ) and are thus viewed as causative of the corresponding syndromes .
<termsem="SO:0001023"> Alleles </term> not associated exclusively with one disorder are considered `` likely null '' <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> [ 19,20 ] .
Some of these <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> fail to support viability in a haploid Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast strain with a null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the XPD <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> rad15 and are thus considered devoid of significant biological activity [ 19 ] .
This classification of <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> as either causative or null currently defines what we refer to as a `` monoallelic '' paradigm of XPD disease .
However , the identification in recent years of XP complementation group D patients with atypical disease presentation , including symptoms of both XP and TTD [ 8 ] , casts doubt on the ability of such a monoallelic paradigm to explain clinical heterogeneity in compound heterozygotes .
Previously , we generated a TTD mouse model ( XPDR722W ) that phenocopies the human syndrome [ 15,21 ] .
Here we report the generation of additional <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> that fail to support viability on their own but nevertheless ameliorate TTD-associated premature segmental ageing , cutaneous features , cellular <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair capacity , and UV survival when present in a compound heterozygote state .
Generation of Xpd Compound Heterozygotes .
We generated an Xpd knock-in <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> with a <termsem="SO:1000008"> point mutation </term> encoding a single <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> change </term> ( XPDG602D ) found in the XPCS patient XPCS2 ( Figure 1A -- 1C ) .
<termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> expression from the targeted <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> could be detected in embryonic stem cells by RT-PCR ( Figure 1D ) , although expression was reduced approximately 5-fold relative to <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA transcript </term> levels as determined by Northern blotting of <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> from the testis of heterozygous animals ( Figure 1E ) .
Because patient XPCS2 was a hemizygote with <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> XPD protein ( XPDG602D ) expressed from a single <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , the corresponding <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> was expected to be viable in the homozygous state .
However , homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice were not observed , neither amongst live births nor embryonic day 13.5 ( E13 .5 ) or E3 .5 embryos ( Table 1 ) .
The corresponding hypomorphic , <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was thus designated as homozygous lethal (  XPCS ) .
Homozygous lethality of the XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is likely due to reduced levels of expression of this essential protein as a result of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting ( Figure 1A ) rather than to the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> itself .
Xpd ablation ( XpdKO/KO ) is similarly incompatible with life beyond the earliest stages of embryogenesis [ 22 ] .
Consistent with this interpretation , a different targeted Xpd <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> encoding XPDR683W , which is associated with XP in the homozygous state in humans , was similarly underexpressed and lethal in the homozygous state ( designated as  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ) ( Figure 1A -- 1C ; Table 1 ; unpublished data ) .
Also , a different targeting approach leading to the use of the <termsem="SO:0000782"> native </term> <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3  UTR </term> and <termsem="SO:0000045"> removal </term> of the neo <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> resulted in normalisation of XpdXPCS <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> levels and viable homozygous XpdXPCS/XPCS ( XPDG602D/G602D ) animals [ 23 ] .

`` Null '' <termsem="SO:0001023"> Allele </term> Can Alleviate Developmental Delay , Skin , and Hair Features of TTD .
To test the potential of a homozygous lethal `` null '' <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> to nevertheless contribute to organismal phenotype , we combined an Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> with a viable XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> by crossing the corresponding heterozygous animals .
Similar to hemizygous TTD mice carrying one true Xpd knockout <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( XpdTTD/KO ) , compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies .
Expression from the Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was also reduced in the testis of compound heterozygous animals , whereas expression from the XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was increased relative to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> by ~ 5-fold ( Figure 1E ) .
Because of a lack of available antibodies and the inability to distinguish amongst various <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutant forms </term> of XPD differing only by single <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitutions </term> , we were unable to ascertain the relative amount of XPD protein from the different <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
Despite reduced levels of <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> expression , the homozygous lethal Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ameliorated multiple XpdTTD-associated disease symptoms in compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS animals including the hallmark brittle hair and cutaneous features fully penetrant in homo - and hemizygous TTD mice ( Figure 2A -- 2C ) .
In marked contrast to XpdTTD/TTD ( and XpdTTD/KO ) mice , which display complete hair loss in the first hair cycle and partial hair loss in subsequent cycles throughout their lives [ 21 ] , compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS mice displayed some hair loss only during the first hair cycle and only locally at the back ( Figure 2A ) .
Scanning electron microscope analysis of XpdTTD /  XPCS hair revealed an almost normal appearance , with TTD-like features such as broken hairs found only at very low frequency ( unpublished data ) .
<termsem="SO:0001237"> Amino acid </term> analysis confirmed that <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> levels in the hair of the XpdTTD /  XPCS mice were significantly higher than in XpdTTD/TTD animals , but remained below the <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> level ( Figure 2C ) .
TTD hemizygotes ( XpdTTD/KO ) do not display significant differences in cutaneous features and longevity relative to homozygous XpdTTD/TTD mice [ 21 ] .

Error bars indicate SEM .
Other prominent TTD features in the epidermis , including acanthosis ( thickening of the layer of the nucleated cells ) , hyperkeratosis ( prominent thickening of the cornified layer ) , and pronounced granular layer and sebacious gland hyperplasia ( causing greasy appearance of the hair ) , were absent in the skin of XpdTTD /  XPCS mice , as established by blind microscopic examination of skin sections ( Figure 2B ) .
Furthermore , anaemia and developmental delay present in patients with TTD [ 24 ] and in XpdTTD/TTD mice [ 15 ] were both partially rescued in compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS mice ( Figure 2D and 2E ) .
Rescue of Progeroid Features in TTD Mice by Homozygous Lethal Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> Alleles </term> .
Because patients with TTD , XPCS , and CS ( but not XP ) and the corresponding mouse models share similar accelerated progeroid symptoms [ 12,13,15,23 ] , we next addressed ageing-related parameters in compound heterozygous mice ( Figure 3 ) .
Whereas XpdTTD/TTD animals show reduced bone mineral density as an indication of the early onset of osteoporosis before ~ 14 mo of age [ 15 ] , tail vertebrae from compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS mice were comparable to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> even at 20 mo of age ( Figure 3B and 3C ) .
Furthermore , whereas XpdTTD/TTD mice developed kyphosis earlier than <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> animals ( onset ~ 3 mo versus 12 -- 20 mo ) , compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS mice did not ( Figure 3B ) .
Overall appearance and body weight curves revealed that TTD-associated age-related premature cachexia and lack of general fitness were fully rescued in compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS mice ( Figure 3A and 3D ) .
Finally , the life span of compound heterozygotes was extended relative to XpdTTD/TTD mice ( Table 2 ) .

Pleiotropic Xpd Biallelic Effects in Mice and Cells .
To determine whether the homozygous lethal Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was unique in its ability to ameliorate symptoms associated with the XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , we generated compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XP mice by crossing the corresponding heterozygous animals .
Similar to the Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , the homozygous lethal Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> rescued cutaneous symptoms including hair loss ( except locally during the first round ; unpublished data ) , reduced <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> content ( <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> index 9.3  0.9 standard deviation [ 87 % of <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> ] , p = 0.01 versus TTD ) , ageing-associated premature cachexia ( males and females were 36.1  6.4 g [ 93 % of <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> ] and 39.2  3.2 g [ 116 % of <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> ] , respectively ) , and reduced life span ( Table 2 ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that two independent <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , which on their own are unable to support viability ( Table 1 ) , were nonetheless able to ameliorate TTD-associated phenotypes in vivo ( Table 2 ) .
Molecular Mechanisms of Biallelic Effects .
We next turned to UV-based cellular assays including unscheduled <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> synthesis after UV irradiation ( UV-UDS ) , recovery of <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> synthesis after UV irradiation ( UV-RRS ) , and UV survival , which report on the NER subpathways ( global <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> NER and transcription-coupled NER ) and total NER , respectively .
In none of these assays was the response to UV improved in compound heterozygotes relative to TTD homozygotes ( Figure 4A -- 4C ) .
However , unlike the in vivo TTD phenotypes described above , in which XpdTTD/TTD and XpdTTD/KO animals were indistinguishable , XpdTTD dosage effects were observed in UV survival , UV-UDS , and UV-RRS , indicating that cellular parameters as measured in fibroblasts here do not always correlate with the phenotype at the level of the intact organism .
XpdTTD/KO hemizygous cells were thus used as the baseline on which to compare the activity of compound heterozygous cells .
Relative to XpdTTD/KO hemizygote cells , UV survival was improved by the homozygous lethal Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in XpdTTD /  XPCS compound heterozygous cells and to a lesser degree by the Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( Figure 4A ) .
Because of embryonic and cellular lethality , we were unable to test UV survival associated exclusively with the Xpd  XPCS or Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
However , homozygous XPDXP ( XPDR683W ) and hemizygous XPDXPCS ( XPDG602D ) human cells are known to be highly sensitive to UV [ 19,25 ] , as are cells from a homozygous viable XpdXPCS/XPCS ( XPDG602D/G602D ) mouse model ( Figure 4A , dotted line ) [ 23 ] .
Thus , the survival of XpdTTD /  XPCS ( and XpdTTD /  XP ) cells likely represents a level of UV resistance that neither <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> can impart on its own ( Table 2 ) .
Significant effects of compound heterozygosity on NER subpathways relative to XpdTTD/KO cells were observed in XpdTTD /  XP cells but only for UV-UDS activity .
Finally , none of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> TFIIH combinations ( carrying <termsem="SO:0001059"> alterations </term> associated with TTD [ XPDR722W ] , XPCS [ XPDG602D ] , or XP [ XPDR683W ] ) exhibited synergism in an in vitro NER reaction reconstituted with different <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> TFIIH complexes ( Figure 4D ) .
Taken together , these data are consistent with interallelic complementation of UV sensitivity in cells but underscore the lack of any correlation between UV-related repair characteristics and TTD progeroid phenotypes in animal models .

( D ) Incision / <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> activity of combinations of <termsem="SO:0000041"> altered </term> TFIIH complexes in a reconstituted NER reaction .
Equal amounts of single or mixed populations of recombinant TFIIHs ( containing XPD , XPB , p62 , p52 , <termsem="SO:0001452"> His </term> - p44 , Flag-p34 , cdk7 , cyclin H , Mat1 , and p8 ) were mixed with recombinant XPG , XPF/ERCC1 , XPC/hHR23B , RPA , and a radiolabelled <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> NER substrate .
The <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> products ( 26 -- 34 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotides </term> in length ) were visualised at <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> resolution on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel as indicated .
Note the weak activity corresponding to each single and combined TFIIH complex ( lanes 3 -- 8 ) relative to the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> ( lane 1 ) and negative controls ( lane 2 ) .

Roman numerals represent different microscopic slides and Arabic numerals different cell lines labelled as follows : ( I ) <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> cells ( 1 ) labelled with 2-m beads , XpdTTD/TTD cells ( 2 ) with 0.79-m beads , and XpdTTD/KO cells ( 3 ) with no beads ; ( II ) <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> cells ( 1 ) labelled with 0.79-m beads and XpdTTD /  XPCS cells ( 4 ) with no beads ; and ( III ) <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> cells ( 1 ) labelled with 0.79-m beads and XpdTTD /  XP cells ( 5 ) with no beads .
( F ) Quantification of immunofluorescent signal from at least 50 nuclei per cell line and 2 -- 6 experiments per <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> .
Bars representing cells analysed on the same microscopic slide are depicted side by side , with <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> set at 100 % .
The p-value indicates minimum significant difference between <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> and the indicated cell lines analysed on the same microscopic slide within one experiment .
Next we asked whether the Xpd  XPCS and Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , despite decreased <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> levels , ameliorated TTD symptoms by increasing overall TFIIH levels in compound heterozygous XpdTTD /  XPCS and XpdTTD /  XP cells .
Previously , using comparative immunohistochemistry , we and others have shown an up to 70 % reduction of TFIIH levels in primary fibroblasts from patients with TTD compared with <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> controls due to reduced stability [ 16,17 ] .
Despite overexpression of <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> from the XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> relative to the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( Figure 1E ) , TFIIH protein levels were reduced by 50 % in primary mouse XpdTTD/TTD fibroblasts ( Figure 4E and 4F ) , thereby mimicking the situation in human patients with TTD .
In accordance with the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> dosage , a further reduction of up to 70 % of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> level was observed in hemizygous XpdTTD/KO cells .
Consistent with low <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> expression levels , neither the Xpd  XPCS nor the Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was able to restore TFIIH abundance to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> levels in XpdTTD compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4E and 4F ) .
Thus , the improved UV survival observed in compound heterozygote cells ( Figure 4A ) and likely the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms ( Figure 3 ) were not due to normalisation of TFIIH levels , suggesting a qualitative rather than a quantitative effect on these phenotypes in vivo .
In contrast , the level of XPCS <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> expression did affect the ability of the encoded protein ( XPDG602D ) to restore the TTD hair phenotype to normal .
Notably , XpdTTD /  XPCS animals had a partial TTD hair phenotype , correlating with low levels of Xpd  XPCS expression , whereas XpdTTD/XPCS animals had <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> hair , correlating with normal expression levels from the viable XpdXPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( Table 2 and unpublished data ) .
Thus , the range of expression levels from these two <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> affected their ability to complement some phenotypes ( hair ) .
An overview of the functional relationships between Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , phenotypes , and the presumed underlying TFIIH function in mice and cells is presented in Table 2 .
Dissection of Biallelic Effects from other Determinants of Phenotype .
Although phenotypic consequences , referred to here as biallelic effects , resulting from two different <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> in compound heterozygote patients have been postulated , such effects have historically been difficult to distinguish from the influence of environment and <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background .
We used a <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> defined mammalian model system under controlled environmental conditions to reveal phenotypic effects attributable specifically to combinations of differentially <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
The observed biallelic effects were of three general types .
In the first , the <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> associated in a homozygous state with a phenotype closer to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> singularly determined the phenotypic outcome , a phenomenon widely known in human recessive disease .
Because these Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> functioned at or near <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> levels with respect to a particular function , we call these effects `` dominant '' .
Such <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> can also be referred to as `` separation of function '' <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , because they allow dissection of the roles of multifunctional proteins in specific phenotypes .
Secondly , highlighting the potential relevance of current findings to all diploid organisms including humans was the observation that in one compound heterozygous animal , the Xpd <termsem="SO:0001023"> allelic </term> relationship could shift from Adominant | arecessive to Arecessive | adominant with respect to different phenotypes in a time-dependent and tissue-specific manner ( see below and Table 2 ) .
In the third type of biallelic effect , known as interallelic complementation , two <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> produced a phenotype closer to <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wt </term> </term> than either could alone in a homo - or hemizygous state .
As summarised in Table 2 , examples of all types of biallelic effects were observed in a variety of Xpd-associated phenotypes , ranging from brittle hair to segmental progeria .
TFIIH in Transcription and Repair : Mechanisms of XPD Disease Pleiotropy .
We observed differences in the ability of XpdTTD versus homozygous lethal Xpd  XPCS and Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to function in two transcription-related phenotypes separated in the organism by both time and space : embryonic lethality and terminal differentiation of enucleating skin and blood cells .
The preblastocyst-stage homozygous lethality shared by the XpdKO , Xpd  XPCS , and Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> most likely reflects a defect in basal transcription that is incompatible with life .
In XpdTTD /  XPCS and XpdTTD /  XP compound heterozygous mice , embryonic lethality was fully rescued by the XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Because embryonic lethality was also fully rescued in XpdTTD/KO hemizygous mice , the XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> can be considered as <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> and thus dominant to each of the homozygous lethal <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> ( XpdKO , Xpd  XPCS , and Xpd  XP ) with respect to this particular phenotype ( Table 2 ) .
TTD-specific cutaneous and anaemic features , on the other hand , are thought to result from a specific kind of transcriptional insufficiency caused by depletion of unstable TFIIH during the terminal differentiation of skin , hair-shaft , and blood cells [ 16,24 ] .
In compound heterozygous mice , both homozygous lethal Xpd  XPCS and Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> were able to alleviate XpdTTD-specific cutaneous and anaemic features and can thus be defined as dominant over the XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> with respect to these phenotypes .
We conclude that the defects leading to embryonic lethality and aberrant terminal differentiation of the skin , hair , and blood represent two qualitatively and/or quantitatively different transcriptional deficiencies .
During early embryonic development , XpdTTD is dominant over the Xpd  XPCS and Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , whereas later in the ontogenesis of skin , hair-shaft , and blood cells , the situation is reversed .
In its role in the repair of UV photolesions , the Xpd  XPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> imparted a clear UV survival benefit over a single XpdTTD <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> or two XpdXPCS <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> independent of expression levels , which is consistent with interallelic complementation .
However , the observation that no other cellular or biochemical UV-related parameters were improved in XpdTTD /  XPCS argues against complementation of this repair activity in the rescue of TTD progeroid symptoms in vivo .
Interallelic Complementation and XPD Function .
What does interallelic complementation tell us about the mechanism of XPD function ?
Interallelic complementation is most often observed in multimeric proteins with multiple functional <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
Unfortunately , the structure -- function relationship between disease-causing <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> and XPD functional <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> , including detailed structural information on XPD or even its stoichiometry within TFIIH , remains unknown .
However , based on the ability of cell extracts that are defective in two different TFIIH components ( XPD and XPB ) to complement NER activity in vitro [ 26 ] , it is likely that TFIIH ( or its components ) can either multimerise or exchange at least during the NER reaction .
Furthermore , XPD is known to be a `` loosely bound '' subunit of TFIIH [ 27 ] .
We thus envisage the molecular mechanism of interallelic complementation to involve the exchange of XPD molecules within the TFIIH complex or turnover of TFIIH complexes containing different XPD molecules at the <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage during the course of the global <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> as well as transcription-coupled repair of either UV-induced or endogenous <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage .
A Biallelic Paradigm for XPD Disorders .
Recently , proteins originating from presumed null <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> were biochemically characterised as inactive in basal transcription [ 27 ] , providing an explanation as to why these <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> failed to rescue lethality in haploid S. pombe with a null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the XPD <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> rad15 [ 19 ] .
Our data suggest that certain presumed null <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , although unable on their own to support basal transcription , may in fact have a substantial impact on disease outcome in compound heterozygous humans , as they do in mouse models .
Clinical evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from a number of XP complementation group D patients that do not fit within the framework of the current monoallelic paradigm of XPD disorders ( Figure 5 ) .
In contrast to two hemizygous XPDXPCS patients carrying the XPDG47R - or XPDR666W-encoding <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> who died of the disease before 2 y of age , two compound heterozygous XPDXPCS patients carrying the same XPDG47R - or XPDR666W-encoding <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> in addition to the presumed null XPDL461V + del716  730 both had considerably milder disease symptoms and survived more than ten times longer ( A. Lehmann , personal communication ) ( Figure 5 ) .
Compound heterozygosity is also associated with the recently reported combination XP and TTD ( XPTTD ) syndrome [ 8 ] .
Similar to the XpdTTD /  XPCS and XpdTTD /  XP mice described here , both patients with XPTTD described so far had intermediate hair <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> values .
Furthermore , XPTTD patient XP38BR carried a `` causative '' TTD <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in one <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and a novel <termsem="SO:1000008"> point mutation </term> encoding XPDL485P in the other .
Although the XPDL485P-encoding <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> fails to complement viability in the haploid S. pombe rad15 <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> strain and is thus interpretable as a null <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> [ 8 ] , we nonetheless suggest that the combined XPTTD phenotype in this patient involves phenotypic contributions from both <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
Taken together , these data suggest a shift to a biallelic paradigm for compound heterozygous patients in XP complementation group D. Genotype -- Phenotype Relationships in XPD Disorders .
According to the current monoallelic hypothesis , phenotype is determined solely by the causative <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> product .
If a second , different <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is present , it is considered a functional null .
There is a lack of any correlation between the <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> of the XPD <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> and the resulting disorder .
We propose a biallelic hypothesis for compound heterozygotes in which both <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> can contribute to the phenotype .
Examples of compound heterozygous patients in which a second , presumed null <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is likely to contribute to disease outcome are provided above in comparison to corresponding homo - or hemizygous patients with the same causative <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Numbers in the schematic of the protein indicate the helicase <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
Potential of Combined Recessive <termsem="SO:0001023"> Alleles </term> to Affect Phenotypic Diversity in Mammals .
In humans , the clinical relevance of biallelic effects such as interallelic complementation remains unknown .
Although interallelic complementation between two endogenous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> has been described in cells from a compound heterozygous patient with methylmalonic acidaemia , no observable effects on disease outcome were noted in the patient [ 28 ] .
Thus , to the best of our knowledge , the amelioration of progeroid features observed here is the first in vivo demonstration in compound heterozygous animals of interallelic complementation relevant to a human disease .
Keeping in mind that the ~ 1,200 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> known to exist for the CTRF <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> implicated in the common autosomal recessive disorder cystic fibrosis alone [ 29 ] can theoretically result in ~ 700,000 different <termsem="SO:0001023"> allelic </term> combinations , the potential number of <termsem="SO:0001023"> allelic </term> combinations of different recessive <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> and <termsem="SO:0000694"> single <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> polymorphisms </term> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide is currently incalculable .
We suggest biallelic effects as a previously underestimated yet important variable in considering <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> -- phenotype relationships from autosomal recessive disease to normal phenotypic diversity in mammals .
Extension of the above concept implies that recessive <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> can enter evolutionary selection in F1 provided that the second <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> carries a different recessive <termsem="SO:0001059"> alteration </term> .
Finally , our data highlight the potential of clinically relevant <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> previously designated as null , with little or no detectable expression or activity , to nonetheless contribute to phenotype .
Derivation and analysis of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
Generation of XpdTTD ( XPDR722W ) and XpdTTD/KO mice has been described previously [ 21,22 ] .
A detailed description of the generation of targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> for Xpd  XPCS and Xpd  XP <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> carrying <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> encoding the G602D and R683W <termsem="SO:0001059"> alterations </term> will be provided upon request .
Chimeric mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were generated according to standard procedures .
Haematoxylin and eosin staining was performed according to standard procedures .
<termsem="SO:0001237"> Amino acid </term> analysis was conducted as described in [ 21 ] .
Blood values were analysed using Animal Blood Counter Vet ( ABX Diagnostix , Montpellier , France ) .
Radiographs were taken , and relative bone mineral density was calculated as described in [ 15 ] .
Mice used in this study were in a 129Ola/C57BL6 mixed background unless noted differently .
All experiments involving mice were judged and approved by the national committee for <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> identification of organisms and the animal ethical committee , and were conducted according to national and international guidelines .
UV sensitivity , UV-UDS , UV-RRS , and TFIIH incision / <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> activity .
UV survival , UV-UDS , and UV-RRS assays were performed as described previously [ 21,30 ] .
For UV-RRS , average values from the representative experiment containing two <termsem="SO:0000817"> wt </term> , three XpdTTD/TTD , two XpdTTD/XPCS , and one XpdTTD/XP cell line are presented .
The ~ 48 % UV-UDS value presented in this study for XpdTTD/TTD cells differs from our previously published data of 25 % UV-UDS [ 21 ] , possibly because of the high variability intrinsic to the assay or routine variations in the cell culture conditions .
For the incision / <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> activity assay , recombinant TFIIH was prepared and assayed as described previously [ 27 ] .
Comparative immunofluorescence .
Latex bead labelling and comparative immunofluorescence analysis of the p62 subunit of the TFIIH was performed as described previously [ 16,17 ] using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts at passages 2 -- 5 .
Two or more cell lines per <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> ( except for the XpdTTD /  XP cells , in which only one cell line was used in repeated experiments ) were used , and experiments were repeated 2 -- 6 times per <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> .
