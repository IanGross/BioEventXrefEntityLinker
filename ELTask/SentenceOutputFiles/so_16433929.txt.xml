m-Calpain is required for preimplantation embryonic development in mice .
-calpain and m-calpain are ubiquitously expressed proteases implicated in cellular migration , cell cycle progression , degenerative processes and cell death .
These heterodimeric <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> are composed of distinct catalytic subunits , encoded by Capn1 ( -calpain ) or Capn2 ( m-calpain ) , and a common regulatory subunit encoded by Capn4 .
Disruption of the mouse Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> abolished both -calpain and m-calpain activity , and resulted in embryonic lethality , thereby suggesting essential roles for one or both of these <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> during mammalian embryogenesis .
Disruption of the Capn1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> produced viable , fertile mice implying that either m-calpain could compensate for the loss of -calpain , or that the loss of m-calpain was responsible for death of Capn4 - / - mice .
To distinguish between the alternatives described above , we <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> an essential <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding region </term> in the mouse Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in embryonic stems cells and transmitted this <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> through the mouse germline .
Breeding of heterozygous animals failed to produce homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> live offspring or implanted embryos .
A nested PCR genotyping protocol was established , and homozygous preimplantation <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> embryos were detected at the morula but not at the blastocyts stage .
We conclude that homozygous disruption of the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> results in pre-implantation embryonic lethality between the morula and blastocyst stage .
This establishes that -calpain and m-calpain have distinct functions , and that m-calpain is vital for development of the preimplantation murine embryo .
The two ubiquitous Ca2 + - dependent , <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> proteases known as -calpain ( calpain-1 ) and m-calpain ( capain-2 ) , are the founding members of a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family comprising 13 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in mammals [ 1-3 ] .
Both are heterodimeric <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> consisting of distinct 80 kDa catalytic subunits , encoded by the Capn1 ( -80 k ) and Capn2 ( m-80 k ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , respectively , that associate with a common 28 kDa regulatory subunit encoded by the Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
The -80 k and m-80 k subunits share 62 % <termsem="SO:0001407"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> sequence </term> identity , and are very similar in terms of structure , protein chemistry , and in vitro substrate specificity .
Despite these similarities , the differential expression patterns of  - and m-calpain in mammalian tissues suggest they have some <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> specific and distinct functions .
The  and m designations derive from the levels of Ca2 + required in vitro for optimal activation ; 10 -- 50 M Ca2 + for -calpain and 0.3 -- 0.35 mM Ca2 + for m-calpain .
It is generally assumed that  - and m-calpain maintain their differential sensitivities to calcium in vivo , although this has not yet been strictly demonstrated .
Furthermore , since the cytoplasmic free Ca2 + concentration is typically less than 1 M , it is also assumed that other in vivo factors must contribute to regulation of these <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> [ 3 ] .
Without apriori knowledge of the factors regulating calpain activity or their relevant substrates , elucidation of biological functions for calpains presents a challenge .
Research on calpains has linked them with a wide variety of functions including muscle growth , development , degeneration ( 3 ) , neuronal growth and neurodegeneration [ 4 ] , cell cycle progression [ 5,6 ] , signal cascades triggered by integrins and growth factors [ 7 ] , membrane protrusion [ 8 ] , remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell migration [ 9-15 ] , and regulation of cell death via both necrosis and apoptosis [ 16-22 ] .
To date , the literature suggests a complex interplay between caspases and calpains [ 23,24 ] and impact of calpain on cell death pathway components [ 25 ] .
The lack of highly specific cell-permeable inhibitors of calpains contributes to the challenge of investigating and defining calpain functions in these processes .
Although over-expression of calpastatin , the endogenous protein inhibitor of  - and m-calpain provides an important approach for these efforts , it will not distinguish <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> specific functions [ 24,26,27 ] .
Some work has suggested <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> specific roles , such as a role for m-calpain in epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced cell motility [ 28,29 ] and a role for -calpain in interferon-inducible protein 9-induced migration of keratinocytes [ 28 ] .
A cell permeable calpain inhibitor ( which likely inhibits other thiol-proteases as well ) has been used to select cells lacking -calpain which display reduced proliferation rates [ 30 ] .
Interestingly , m-calpain expression persisted in these cells , suggesting a possible requirement of m-calpain for cell survival [ 30 ] .
Targeted <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> in mice provides a powerful approach to determining the physiological roles of  - and m-calpain and the opportunity to approach their <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> specific functions .
Initial studies targeted Capn4 based on the prediction that loss of this calpain subunit would abolish activity of both  - and m-calpain .
Capn4 - / - murine embryos died between days 10 and 11 of gestation , and there was no detectable  - or m-calpain activity in these or younger embryos [ 31 ] .
Capn4 - / - murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) could be cultured from these embryos , although they also lacked calpain activity as assessed by casein zymography or by the formation of characteristic spectrin breakdown products , and they displayed migration defects consistent with a role for calpain in release of focal adhesions [ 9 ] .
An independently derived Capn4 knockout , involving a more extensive <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , resulted in an earlier embryonic lethality , apparently at a pre-implantation stage [ 32 ] .
The different times of embryonic lethality suggested that the first reported Capn4 - / - mice [ 31 ] were targeted with a hypomorphic <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> , which retained some small level of calpain activity , allowing for their survival to mid-gestation , while the second reported Capn4 - / - mice [ 32 ] represented a true null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> .
Disruption of Capn1 , encoding the -calpain catalytic subunit , was subsequently reported to result in fertile , viable mice with some mild defects in the -calpain rich platelets relating to their aggregation and clot retraction [ 33 ] .
The fact that Capn4 null mice die during embryogenesis indicates that at least one of the ubiquitous calpains is essential for development to term .
The viability of Capn1-deficient mice does not however distinguish between two possibilities : either that m-calpain is specifically required during embryogenesis , or that either <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> of calpain alone is sufficient and can compensate for the absence of the other .
To resolve this question , we have now knocked out the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encoding the m-80 k subunit in mice .
We report here that Capn2 null embryos died prior to the implantation stage , indicating that m-calpain is indispensable for early embryogenesis .
This role can not be fulfilled by -calpain , which is expressed in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells [ 31 ] and is assumed to be present at this stage of gestation .
This demonstrates unequivocally that m-calpain and -calpain have distinct physiological roles during early embryogenesis .
Isolation and characterization of Capn2 targeted ES cell clones .
Two independent Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cell lines , designated ES27 and ES36 , were isolated from a screen of 305 drug-resistant clones .
Correct targeting of the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> was established both by Southern blot hybridization and PCR analysis .
A <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> located outside the short ( upstream ) arm of homology hybridized to a 3.5-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and 5.3-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> as predicted from <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> maps ( Figure 2A ) .

A <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> derived from the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> recognized only the 5.3-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> in Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cells , suggesting that the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> had <termsem="SO:0000046"> integrated </term> solely at the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> ( not shown ) .
A PCR screening method was also established that generated a <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> of 2,749 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> and a 2,711 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
The 2,711 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> was only evident in the two targeted cell lines ( Figure 2B ) .
Characterization of targeted ES cell lines .
( A ) Targeted disruption of the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> was detected initially by Southern blotting .
Membranes were blotted with BamHI-digested <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> extracted from ES cells and hybridized with a DIG-labeled 823 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> BamHI/HindIII <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> located immediately upstream of the short arm of the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> ( Figure 1 ) .
A 3.5-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> corresponding to the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was present in all cells , whereas a 5.3-kb <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was detected in two targeted cell lines , designated ES27 and ES36 .
( B ) PCR genotyping was carried out with two separate reactions designed to amplify either a 2,748 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> or a 2,711 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Both reactions used a common sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> located in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 4 , outside the short arm of the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , and distinct <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> - specific <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> .
The reaction to detect the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> used an <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> located in <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 7 while the amplification of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> was done with an <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> in the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> .
The results confirm the presence of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in all cells , whereas the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> signal was observed only in the two targeted clones .

Generation of chimeric mice and germline transmission of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Capn2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Eight chimeric male mice were produced in morula aggregation experiments using the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES27 cell line .
Two of these males transmitted the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES27 <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> through the germline into the F1 generation .
Heterozygous Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals appeared normal , with no obvious defects in gross anatomy , reproduction , or life span .
Out of 199 weanlings from heterozygous intercrosses , no Capn2 - / - progeny were detected ( Table 2 ) .
We did not observe high rates of perinatal death , and no Capn2 - / - stillborns were observed .
This suggested that Capn2 - / - animals perished at some stage during embryonic development .
In an attempt to determine if embryonic death occurred at a post-implantation stage , embryos were harvested for genotyping at different times between E10 .5 and E18 .5 .
No Capn2 - / - embryos were observed and no signs of embryo resorption were detected ( Table 2 ) .
This indicated that the Capn2 - / - embryos might be dying prior to implantation .
Embryos were then flushed from the oviducts of pregnant females at E2 .5 or E3 .5 , and genotyped by means of a nested PCR strategy ( Figure 4 ) .
Two of 90 successfully genotyped pre-implantation embryos were Capn2 - / - , ( Table 2 ; Figure 5 ) .
Both of these Capn2 - / - embryos were isolated at the 8-cell stage and did not display any obvious morphological defects .
None of the 46 successfully genotyped blastocyst-staged embryos were Capn2 - / - .
The scarcity of Capn2-deficient embryos surviving to the 8-cell stage suggested that the loss of m-calpain activity must fatally compromise the viability of early embryos .
Furthermore , it is possible that persistence of some maternally derived <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA transcript </term> or protein might have allowed a small number of Capn2 - / - embryos to survive to the morula-stage .

Nested PCR strategy for genotyping of pre-implantation embryos .
Due to the scarcity of extractable <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> material , a nested PCR strategy was developed in order to <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> pre-implantation embryos .
Separate reactions were used to amplify a 429 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and a 389 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , both spanning the 3 ' end of the short ( upstream ) arm of the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> .
In both reactions , a 213 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> located within the short arm was co-amplified with the ` diagnostic ' <termsem="SO:0000006"> products </term> as an internal control .
The same sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> were used to amplify ` diagnostic ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in both reactions , whereas the <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> were <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> - specific .
The <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> , represented by triangles , are depicted in two ( nested ) sets for each of the three reactions .
<termsem="SO:0000147"> Exons </term> are represented by open , vertical rectangles , the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> by an open , horizontal rectangle , while thin vertical lines denote the <termsem="SO:0000699"> boundaries </term> of the short arm and the 5 ' end of the long ( downstream ) arm .

Genotyping of pre-implantation embryos .
A nested PCR strategy was used to genotype embryos prior to implantation as described in Figure 4 .
Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - mice were mated and the date of fertilization established by the appearance of vaginal plugs .
Blastocyst ( E3 .5 ) or 8-cell embryos ( E2 .5 ) were flushed from the oviducts and then digested with proteinase K .

( A ) A representative example of the genotyping of blastocyst stage embryos .
Embryos # 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 were Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - whereas embryos # 3 and # 7 were Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> , denoted by the absence of the 389 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutant </term> signal .
( B ) An example of the genotyping of 8-cell embryos is shown .
Embryos # 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 were Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - while embryo # 4 was Capn2 - / - , marked by the absence of the 429 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> signal .
( M ) denotes the molecular weight marker .
The genotyping results for weanlings , post-implantation , and pre-implantation embryos are shown in Table 2 .
Curiously , the ratio of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> to Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals from inbred heterozygous intercrosses was substantially less than the predicted 1:2 Mendelian ratio .
In a group of 199 animals derived from heterozygote breeding ( 33 litters ) , 23 Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ( 11.6 % ) and 176 ( 88.4 % ) Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals were observed .
The ratio of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> to Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals among males ( 14 % to 82 % ) or females ( 13 % to 90 % ) was essentially the same is it was for the combined population , and there were an average of six pups per litter , which is normal for this background strain .
A larger than expected proportion Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals was also evident in both post-implantation and pre-implantation embryos ( Table 2 ) .
Interestingly , a similar over-representation of heterozygous animals was also reported in one of the Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> lines , though the <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> skewing was not as extreme [ 32 ] .
Crosses between Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> and Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals also resulted in a greater than expected proportion of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals ( Table 2 ) .
An even higher degree of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - over-representation was seen when the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> came the mother ( 73 % ) compared to when it came from the father ( 59 % ) .
In these crosses the ratios of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> to Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - animals among males or females compared well with the ratio in the combined populations ; 77 % of males and 69 % of females were Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - when the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> came from the mother , and 62 % of males and 55 % of females were Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - when the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> came from the father .
Attempted generation of Capn2 - / - ES cells .
Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cells were subjected to clonal selection in the presence of 2 mg/mL G418 in attempts to generate homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> cells by <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> conversion .
This procedure has been extensively applied to targeted ES cells and was readily achieved in the case of Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cells [ 31 ] .
In this case , however , no Capn2 - / - ES cells were isolated in screens of 126 drug-resistant clones .
The inability to isolate Capn2 - / - ES cells , in concert with the absence of Capn2 - / - embryos beyond the 8-cell stage , suggested that m-calpain activity might be essential for cell viability or the establishment of viable ES cell clones .
Although calpain activity was first identified four decades ago , a clear understanding of the substrates and functions of the <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> has remained elusive .
In large part , this has been due to the lack of inhibitors capable of specifically down-regulating the calpains without affecting other proteases .
In the past decade , the story has been further complicated by the discovery of a number of previously unknown <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> which may be differently regulated and have different substrate specificity .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> targeting in mice has provided a powerful approach to examine the physiologic roles of individual calpain <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> .
This was first used to disrupt the Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , encoding the small regulatory subunit common to both  - and m-calpain .
Two independent laboratories observed embryonic lethality in Capn4 knockout mice , albeit at different stages of development [ 31,32 ] .
These observations supported the hypothesis that the small subunit is required for both  - and m-calpain , and furthermore suggested four possibilities regarding their requirement for embryonic development : 1 ) both <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> were required ; 2 ) -calpain was required ; 3 ) m-calpain was required , or 4 )  - and m-calpain are redundant , and one or the other <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> was required .
These options were narrowed down by the subsequent observation that Capn1 - / - mice , which lack the -calpain catalytic subunit , were healthy and fertile , although platelet aggregation and clot retraction defects were observed [ 33 ] .
At that point , we were left with the last two possibilities that either m-calpain was specifically required during embryogenesis , or that either <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> alone was sufficient for sustaining embryonic viability .
We report here that Capn2 - / - mice , which lack the m-calpain catalytic subunit , die at the preimplantation stage of development .
This observation allows us to now conclude that m-calpain is specifically required during embryogenesis .
Since homozygous disruption of the Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was also expected to abolish m-calpain activity , this result is in agreement with the phenotype presented by one of the two Capn4 targeted lines in which preimplantation lethality of null embryos was also observed [ 32 ] .
The survival of Capn4 - / - embryos from the original targeted line reported by Arthur and colleagues to mid-gestation is more difficult to reconcile [ 31 ] .
In retrospect , it seems likely that the latter line represents a hypomorphic state , rather than a true null .
The Capn4 targeting strategy employed by Arthur and colleagues involved disrupting the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminus </term> of the calpain small subunit by <termsem="SO:0000046"> insertion </term> of the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> into the middle of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 9 , which caused truncation of the protein [ 31 ] .
This strategy was based upon previous structure/function studies showing that <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> of the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> 25 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid residues </term> of the small subunit abolished calpain activity when co-expressed with the m-calpain large subunit in E. coli [ 34 ] .
In contrast , the Capn4 targeting strategy employed by Zimmerman and colleagues involved a much more extensive <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 4 through 8 [ 32 ] .
It now seems probable that the difference in the time of lethality of these two targeted Capn4 lines can be explained by different extents of disruption .
The Zimmerman <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> probably represents a true null <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> while the Arthur <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is likely a hypomorphic <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> .
Alternate targeting strategies have been shown to yield different phenotypes in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> disruption studies .
For example , three different targeting strategies were independently used to disrupt the mixed lineage leukemia ( Mll ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
In all three studies , homozygous null embryos perished during embryogenesis , but at different stages ( E0 .5 , E10 .5 , E14 .5 ) [ 35 ] .
The variation in phenotype was attributed to the differences in degree of function of the truncated proteins produced from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
A similar effect might be at work in the two Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> lines .
Efforts were made to detect <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> or calpain activities derived from the Arthur Capn4 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
This <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> gave rise to multiple <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> <termsem="SO:0001060"> species </term> , detectable by RT-PCR , reading through from the first half of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 9 to at least two different <termsem="SO:0000976"> cryptic </term> <termsem="SO:0000162"> splice sites </term> in the PGK <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter sequence </term> [ 31 ] .
These <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> could give rise to defective calpain small subunits with 10 -- 30 inappropriate <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> acids , which might be sufficient to support a low level of calpain activity .
However , expression of calpains with these <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> small subunits did not give rise to any detectable calpain activity when expressed in E. coli , although their functionality in mammalian cells has yet to be determined ( J.S. Elce , unpublished work ) It has also been suggested that calpain large subunits alone might provide some activity in eukaryotic cells , although the Zimmerman et al. knockout appears to exclude that possibility , and no calpain activity was observed in our hands when calpain large subunits were expressed alone either in E. coli or in mammalian cells [ 36 ] .
The different timing of lethality in the Capn4 knockouts might also be a consequence of the different <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> backgrounds of the two <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> lines , which has been observed to influence the phenotype of <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> mice on a number of occasions [ 37 ] .
One of the enduring questions in calpain research has been whether the two ubiquitous <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> ,  - and m-calpain , possess distinct in vivo roles .
The two <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> share 62 % <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> identity and are very similar in their structure and biochemistry .
Notably , they cleave essentially the same set of substrates in vitro , suggesting that they have the potential to carry out the same functions in vivo .
On the other hand , since they require different amounts of Ca2 + for in vitro activation , it is possible that the two <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> are differentially regulated inside cells .
It is now clear , from the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting work done in mice , that  - and m-calpain have some distinct physiological roles , at least during embryogenesis .
As noted , whereas Capn2 null murine embryos die prior to implantation , homozygous disruption of the -calpain large subunit <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , Capn1 , did not affect the viability of mice [ 33 ] .
The principal phenotype observed as a result of Capn1 deficiency involved a disturbance in platelet function , possibly at the level of the <termsem="SO:0001446"> tyrosine </term> phosphorylation of certain proteins involved in platelet activation .
Both  - and m-calpain activities are present in most mammalian cells , although the published data , owing to weaknesses in the available methodology , do not provide reliable estimates of their relative amounts .
Platelets and erythrocytes contain abundant -calpain activity , while m-calpain activity is barely detectable .
Compensation for -calpain deficiency by m-calpain is therefore less likely in platelets and erythrocytes than in other cell types .
As a result , it is not possible to determine whether the absence of marked phenotype in Capn1 - / - animals is due to a compensatory affect by the remaining m-calpain activity , or whether the functions of -calpain are simply not essential .
In contrast , lethality in Capn2 - / - embryos demonstrates that m-calpain activity is essential for embryonic development beyond the 8-cell stage .
It follows that at least some functions of -calpain and m-calpain are distinct .
The underlying cause of the preimplantation lethality in Capn2 - / - embryos has not yet been clarified .
The two homozygous null embryos identified at the 8-cell stage did not present any obvious morphological defects .
However , the fact that only two out of 90 successfully genotyped pre-implantation embryos proved to be Capn2 - / - is in itself revealing .
Preimplantation lethality resulting from <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> knockouts can typically be attributed to two general causes .
In some cases , defects are incurred in the embryonic differentiation program which can often be observed morphologically [ 38 ] .
Null embryos of this type often survive beyond the morula stage , and a Mendelian distribution of embryonic <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotypes </term> is usually noted .
In other cases , however , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> disruption is thought to compromise fatally the viability of cells in the early embryo [ 3,39-43 ] .
In these instances , only a few null embryos are ever observed and homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> ES cells could not be isolated .
The Capn2 knockout fits into the latter category .
If it is true that m-calpain is essential for some aspect of cell viability , the survival of a few Capn2 - / - embryos to the 8-cell stage is most likely due to the persistence of some maternal m-calpain <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> and/or protein through 2 -- 3 cell divisions .
The mechanistic reasons for lethality in the absence of m-calpain are still unclear .
There have been several reports of m-calpain involvement in cell proliferation in certain circumstances , including reports of its involvement in <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> segregation during mitosis [ 44 ] as well as during meiosis [ 45 ] .
Defects in migration , reported in Capn4 - / - cells [ 9 ] , could contribute to failed embryonic development .
The association between calpain and cell viability has been noted in Capn4 - / - MEFs and other cell lines , although the reported work frequently did not distinguish between  - and m-calpain , and did not show that calpain was strictly essential [ 5,6 ] .
In both CHO cells and Capn4 - / - MEFs , calpain was shown to influence cell proliferation , but only at very low cell densities [ 5 ] .
Calpain has also been associated with progression through the G1 stage of the cell cycle [ 6 ] .
Furthermore , some of the proteins known to be involved in cell cycle progression , such as p53 , p107 , cyclin D1 , and p27kip1 are reputed to be calpain substrates [ 3 ] .
Sperm binding to the oocyte leads to increased cytoplasmic calcium which triggers the acrosome reaction [ 46 ] .
Both  - and m-calpain have recently been detected in rodent sperm [ 47 ] and oocytes [ 45 ] .
m-calpain was implicated in the acrosome reaction [ 47 ] which correlated with a translocation of m-calpain to the cortical membrane in oocytes where it might participate in the release of cortical granule contents required to prevent polyspermy [ 45 ] .
m-calpain also relocalized to the oocyte meiotic spindle after fertilization , were it could be involved in <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> segregation [ 45 ] .
Polyspermy or defective <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> segregation would both have lethal effects on early embryonic development .
It should also be stressed that Capn4 - / - ES and MEF cells from the presumptive hypomorphic <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> can be maintained in culture despite an apparent lack of calpain activity , as assessed by casein zymography or by the appearance of characteristic spectrin breakdown products .
It is conceivable , as discussed earlier , that a trace amount of calpain activity , beneath levels detectable by these methods , is retained from this <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> Capn4 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , and it is sufficient for maintaining the viability of the cells .
Furthermore , calpain-independent mechanisms for protecting cell viability might exist in these cell lines that are absent in early embryonic cells .
The repeated failure to achieve <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> conversion of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - to Capn2 - / - ES cells by selection of clones in high concentrations of G418 suggests that the homozygous mutant state somehow compromises cell viability or clonal selection of ES cells .
Efforts are under way to express the m-80 k subunit from a Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000814"> rescue </term> <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> prior to <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> conversion in order to preemptively rescue m-calpain activity before the remaining endogenous <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is lost .
However , difficulty in achieving stable expression of the <termsem="SO:0000814"> rescue </term> <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> has thus far hampered these attempts .
One curiosity which arose during the genotyping of progeny from heterozygous interbreeding was the highly non-Mendelian ratio of Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ( 11.6 % ) to Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ( 88.4 % ) of weanlings .
At present , there is no obvious explanation for this result .
Crosses between <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and heterozygous mice also produced progeny with a greater than expected proportion of heterozygous offspring .
Interestingly , heterozygous crosses involving the Capn4 <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> line generated by Zimmerman and colleagues yielded progeny with a similar , if less extreme , skewing in favor of the heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> .
Out of a total of 80 genotyped animals , 22.5 % were <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and 77.5 % were heterozygous , with no homozygous null progeny observed [ 32 ] .
These observations suggest a developmental advantage associated with reduced calpain expression .
Perhaps future studies will reveal a mechanistic basis for this .
The work presented here has clarified two important questions regarding the physiological roles of the two ubiquitous calpain <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> ,  - and m-calpain .
Firstly , it was determined that m-calpain plays an indispensable role in murine embryogenesis , possibly related to pre-implantation development .
Furthermore , this function can not be carried out by -calpain despite the apparent in vitro similarities of  - and m-calpain , demonstrating that the two <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> clearly have some distinct roles in vivo .
The functions of m-calpain during post-implantation embryogenesis and in adult mice remain to be elucidated and will have to be addressed using a conditional <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting strategy .
Cloning and sequencing of the mouse Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
The mouse Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encodes the 700 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> of the m-calpain large subunit ( m-80 k ) and consists of 21 <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> extending over 50-kb on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 1 .
A <termsem="SO:0000317"> cDNA clone </term> encoding a <termsem="SO:0000001"> portion </term> of the mouse m-80 k subunit was purchased ( dbEST Id , 807416 , Image : 606689 , Image Consortium , LLNL ) .
It was found to contain 2.8-kb of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> from <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> 247 of the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> to the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> at <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> 2,101 , including the <termsem="SO:0000204"> 3 ' - UTR </term> to the <termsem="SO:0000551"> <termsem="SO:0000610"> polyA </term> signal </term> .
A <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> of this <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was subcloned and used to screen a 129Sv mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> library in <termsem="SO:0000754">  </term> - Dash II .
<termsem="SO:0000068"> Overlapping </term> <termsem="SO:0000040"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> clones </term> were obtained covering 15,354 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> , extending from a BamHI <termsem="SO:0001014"> site in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> </term> 3 to a BamHI <termsem="SO:0001014"> site in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> </term> 15 .
These <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were sequenced completely on both <termsem="SO:0000001"> strands </term> and the data were submitted to GenBank ( accession no .
AF497625 ) .
The submitted <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> agreed precisely with the public databases , and also filled in several small <termsem="SO:0000730"> gaps </term> corresponding to short <termsem="SO:0000657"> repetitive </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> which could only be firmly established by repeated sequencing in non-standard conditions .
Construction of the Capn2 targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> .
A targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> was designed to <termsem="SO:0000048"> replace </term> a 785 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> BamHI-HindIII <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> , containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 7 of the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , with the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> ( Figure 1 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000147"> Exon </term> 7 encodes 24 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> in the active - <termsem="SO:0000001"> site region </term> , including Asn286 , one of the catalytic triad <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> .
The short ( upstream ) arm of the targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> was provided by a 2.7-kb HindIII-BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> , containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 5 and 6 , which was <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> into the pPNT <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> upstream of the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> [ 48 ] .
During cloning , the BamHI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> at the 3 ' end of the short arm was <termsem="SO:0000045"> abolished </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0000045"> loss </term> of this BamHI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , coupled with the <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduction </term> of a new BamHI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> at the 3 ' end of the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> , provided a basis for distinguishing the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> by Southern blotting .
The long ( downstream ) arm of homology was provided by a 7-kb HindIII-KpnI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> , extending from <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 7 to <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 12 , <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> between the PGK-Neo and thymidine kinase ( tk ) <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassettes </term> .
Targeting strategy for disruption of the murine Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
The murine Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , encoding the m-80 k subunit , was disrupted in ES cells by homologous recombination .
The structures of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( top ) , the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> ( middle ) , and the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( bottom ) are depicted .
In the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , a PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaces </term> a 0.8-kb <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 7 ( grey rectangle ) which encodes the <termsem="SO:0100019"> active site </term> <termsem="SO:0001449"> asparagine residue </term> ( Asn286 ) In the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> is <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by 2.7-kb of Capn2 homologous <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> in the upstream ( short ) arm and 7.9-kb of homology in the downstream ( long ) arm .
A <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> located immediately outside of the short arm detects a 3.5-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and a 5.3-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000147"> Exons </term> are depicted as open vertical rectangles except for <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 7 which is represented by a solid vertical rectangle .
The <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> used in most Southern blot analyses is shown as a solid , horizontal rectangle , while triangles mark the <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> of PCR <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> also used for genotyping purposes .
ES cell culture , transfection and selection of targeted clones .
Mouse R1 ES cells [ 49 ] were maintained on gelatin-coated plates with feeder layers of mouse embryonic fibroblasts at 37 C under 5 % CO2 in ES cell medium ( DMEM [ high glucose ] supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum , 0.1 mM non-essential <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , 2 mM glutamine , 1 mM sodium pyruvate , 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 100 U/ml penicillin , 100 g/ml streptomycin , 25 g/ml amphotericin , and 1,000 U/ml of ESGro [ Chemicon ] ) .
Fetal bovine serum from HyClone Laboratories Inc ( Logan , Utah ) was tested for its ability to support ES cell growth .
Gelatin was from Sigma-Aldrich Canada ( Oakville , Ontario ) .
Unless otherwise specified , all other tissue culture reagents were from Gibco-BRL .
The targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> was linearized by NotI digestion and electroporated into R1 ES cells .
Cells were plated without feeder layers on gelatin-coated plates and transformed clones were selected in the presence of 200 g/ml G418 ( Gibco - BRL ) and 2 M ganciclovir ( Syntex , Inc. ) for eight days .
Drug-resistant clones were picked , expanded on gelatin-coated plates , and genotyped by Southern blotting and PCR analysis ( see below ) .
Generation of targeted mice .
Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - ES cells were aggregated overnight with 8-cell embryos recovered from CD1 matings , as previously described [ 31 ] .
On the next day , blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant CD1 females .
Chimeric animals were identifiable at birth by black eye pigmentation and subsequently by patches of agouti coat colour .
Chimeric males were bred with CD1 females to identify those males capable of germline transmission .
These were then bred with 129SvJ females to establish the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in an inbred <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background .
Mouse protocols were approved by the Queen 's University Animal Care Committee according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care .
Several Southern blot and PCR strategies were exploited in order to determine the <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> of the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
Southern blotting was carried out using the digoxigenin ( DIG ) non-radioactive system ( Roche ) .
In most cases , membranes were blotted with BamHI-digested <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> and hybridized with a DIG-labeled 823 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 4-containing BamHI-HindIII <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> located immediately upstream of the short arm of homology ( Figure 1 ) .
A 681 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> PstI-XbaI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> was also used to probe Southern blots in order to verify a single <termsem="SO:0000046"> integration event </term> in targeted clones .
Genotyping was also carried out by PCR analysis of <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of all <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> are listed in Table 1 .
A single-step PCR strategy was sufficient for genotyping ES cells or biopsies from post-implantation embryos and weanlings ( Figure 1 ) .
A 2,748 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and a 2,711 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were amplified in separate reactions using a common ( <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 4 ) sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> , located outside the short arm of homology , and distinct <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> which hybridized to either <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 7 ) or <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> ( PGK-Neo ) sequence ( Table I ) .
The thermocycling parameters included a five minute initial denaturation step at 95 C , 30 cycles of one minute denaturation at 95 C , one minute annealing at 56 C , and one minute extension at 72 C , with a ten minute final extension step .
<termsem="SO:0000696"> Oligonucleotide </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> used to genotype the Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
Due to the limited amount of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> material available in pre-implantation embryos , a nested PCR strategy was developed to yield reliable genotyping information ( Figure 4 ) .
Whole embryos were first digested in 20 L of proteinase K buffer ( see below ) .
The lysate was then divided in two , with half ( 10 L ) being used in the amplification of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> and the remaining 10 L in the amplification of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
The first reaction in the nested PCR amplification of the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was carried out in a final reaction volume of 50 L , using an <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 6 sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and an <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> located in <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 7 .
Two L of the first reaction were used as template in the second PCR amplification using another <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 6 sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and an <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> in <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 7 .
The nested amplification of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was carried out similarly .
The first <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair consisted of the <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 6 sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and an <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> in the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> .
The nested <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair was comprised of the second <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 6 sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and an <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> also located within the PGK-Neo <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> .
It should be noted that amplification of both <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> involved the same sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> in both steps of the nested PCR strategy .
In addition , the two sets of reactions included a common internal control <termsem="SO:0000546"> designed </term> to amplify a <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> within the short arm of the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> that is preserved in both the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
The first <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair of the control PCR was made up of an <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 4 sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and an <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 5 <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> .
The second <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> pair comprised an <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 5 sense <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> and a nested <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 5 <termsem="SO:0000077"> antisense </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> .
The final <termsem="SO:0000006"> products </term> were 213 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> for the control PCR , 429 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> for the <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> PCR , and 389 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> for the <termsem="SO:0001060"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> PCR .
All reactions were carried out using identical PCR conditions entailing an initial five minute denaturation at 95 C , 35 cycles of one minute denaturation at 95 C , one minute annealing at 56 C , and one minute extension at 72 C , with a final extension step of ten minutes .
Isolation of pre-implantation embryos .
Time of fertilization was determined by observation of copulation plugs , and noon of that day was defined as E0 .5 .
Pre-implantation embryos were obtained by dissecting the uteri out of pregnant females at E2 .5 or E3 .5 and flushing the oviducts with ES cell medium .
Isolated embryos were then digested for five hours at 55 C in 20 L of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 0.5 % Triton X-100 , 200 L/mL proteinase K , pH 8.0 ) , followed by ten minutes at 95 C to inactivate the proteinase K. Lysates were then used for PCR genotyping .

Genotyping of weanlings from heterozygote intercrosses .
A representative example of the Southern blot genotyping of progeny from a Capn2 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - intercross is shown .
<termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> Genomic </term> DNA </term> was extracted from mouse tail biopsies taken from three-week old weanlings and genotyped by Southern blotting as described in Figure 1 .
A 3.5-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was detected in all animals while a 5.3-kb BamHI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> was observed in a subset of progeny .
No Capn2 - / - offspring were detected among weanlings or post-implantation embryos , nor were embryo resorption sites observed .
These results indicate that Capn2 - / - embryos perished at a pre-implantation stage .
