A Chemoattractant Role for <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> in Proprioceptive Axon Guidance .
Neurotrophin-3 ( NT-3 ) is required for proprioceptive neuron survival .
Deletion of the proapoptotic gene <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> knockout mice rescues these neurons and allows for examination of their axon growth in the absence of <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> signaling .
<termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive peripheral and central axons from dorsal root ganglia follow proper trajectories and arrive in close proximity to their targets but fail to innervate them .
Peripherally , muscle spindles are absent and <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive axons do not enter their target muscles .
Centrally , proprioceptive axons branch in ectopic regions of the spinal cord , even crossing the midline .
In vitro assays reveal chemoattractant effects of NT-3 on dorsal root ganglion axons .
Our results show that survival factor <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> acts as a short-distance axon guidance molecule for muscle sensory afferents as they approach their proper targets .
Neurotrophin-3 ( NT-3 ) is a key requirement for the development of proprioceptive inputs to motor neurons ( Chen and Frank 1999 ; Chen et al. 2003 ) .
Mice deficient in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> , its tyrosine kinase receptor , <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> , or in <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive neuron-specific transcription factor <termsem="EG:12399"> Runx3 </term> display severe ataxia associated with the absence of muscle spindles , and loss of proprioceptive neurons in dorsal root ganglia ( DRGs ) or their axons ( Ernfors et al. 1994 ; Klein et al. 1994 ; Tessarollo et al. 1994 ; Farias et al. 1996 ; Liebl et al. 1997 ; Inoue et al. 2002 ; Levanon et al. 2002 ) .
NT-3 is expressed in the ventral spinal cord , in the developing limb buds , and in intrafusal bag fibers of muscle spindles later in development ( Copray and Brouwer 1994 ; Farias et al. 1996 ; Tojo et al. 1996 ) .
When sensory axons contact developing myotubes , they induce muscle spindle differentiation , forming ring-like spiral nerve endings around them .
In the chicken embryo , limb ablations or anti-NT-3 antibody injections into limb buds lead to elimination of <termsem="EG:396081"> TrkC </term> - positive neurons and decreased innervation of motor neurons ( Oakley et al. 1995 , 1997 ) .
Is NT-3 only a chemotrophic survival factor for muscle sensory afferents , or does it have additional roles in the development of the proprioceptors and the establishment of the monosynaptic reflex arc ?
Here we provide evidence that <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> acts as a chemoattractant for sensory axons during the final phase of their target-directed pathfinding .
<termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - Positive DRG Neurons Are Rescued in <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> Double Knockout Mice .
Mice lacking proapoptotic protein <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> allow for distinguishing survival effects of neurotrophins from other effects .
Bax-deficient sensory neurons no longer require neurotrophins for survival ( White et al. 1998 ; Patel et al. 2000 ) , thus they can be used to examine axonal effects .
We bred <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> heterozygote and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> knockout ( KO ) mice to obtain mice with double KO of both <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> genes , and examined proprioceptive axonal projections .
All <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> and double KOs died within 48 h after birth ( Tessarollo et al. 1994 ) .
We performed <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> / <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> double immunohistochemistry ( Huang et al. 1999 ) , enabling detection of both proteins in the same sample .
<termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive cells ( Figure 1A ) and fibers ( Figure 1E ) were absent in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KOs at embryonic day ( E ) 15 .
Two subsets of DRG cells expressing either <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> or <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> were detected in double KOs , similar to wild-type ( WT ) or <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO animals .
Surprisingly , at postnatal day ( P ) 0 , a few cells expressed <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> even in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO animals in the <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> + / + genetic background , and some cells co-expressed <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> and <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> , regardless of the genotype ( Figure 1B ) .
In order to quantify our results , we analyzed the ratio of <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> and <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> immunopositive cells from four different DRGs of animals of different genotypes .
At all ages studied , <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double null DRGs had <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> / <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> ratios similar to those of <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> null DRGs , and higher than those of <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> null DRGs ( Figure 1D ) .
<termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive neurons rescued by <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> deletion , however , failed to differentiate properly , as evidenced by the lack of expression of the proprioceptive molecular marker <termsem="EG:19293"> Parvalbumin </term> ( <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> ) ( Figure 1C ) .
<termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> Is Necessary for Proper Innervation of Motor Neurons .
<termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> / <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive fibers in the spinal cord could be detected at E15 ( Figure 1E ) .
<termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> - positive fibers were restricted to and terminated in the dorsolateral spinal cord , whereas <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive fibers entered the cord dorsomedially , and descended into the ventral horns in WT ( Ozaki and Snider 1997 ) and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO embryos .
There was no detectable <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> expression in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO spinal cord , indicating complete absence of proprioceptive fibers .
In double KO spinal cord , <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive fibers entered the dorsal spinal cord and descended medially in a manner similar to that seen in WT or <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO cases .
However , it was not possible to follow <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> immunolabeled fibers all the way to their terminal zones in any of the cases .
Next we examined the central projections of DRG axons with the lipophilic tracer DiI at P0 .
In WT and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO pups , proprioceptive afferents entered the dorsal spinal cord and followed a medial course towards the ventral horn .
They then turned laterally towards motor neurons in the lateral motor column , where they branched and terminated ( Figure 2A ) .
DiI labeling was confined to dorsal spinal cord in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KOs ( Figure 2A ) , as reported earlier , consistent with a complete absence of proprioceptive innervation ( Ernfors et al. 1994 ; Tessarollo et al. 1994 ) .
In double KOs , proprioceptive afferents initially followed a trajectory similar to that of WT counterparts , but most of them failed to project all the way to the ventral cord and into the lateral motor column .
Instead , they arborized near the ventral midline ; some crossed the midline and extended into the contralateral ventral cord ( Figure 2A and 2C ) .
In order to distinguish between a role for <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> in initiation of motor neuron innervation and a role for maintenance , we repeated the DiI labeling at E17 .
Innervation patterns of E17 spinal cords ( Figure 3 ) were similar to those at P0 ( Figure 2 ) .
Dorsal horns of all genotypes were filled with DiI-labeled fibers corresponding to nerve growth factor -- dependent nociceptive axons .
In WT and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO embryos , proprioceptive fibers extended towards ventral horn motor neurons ( Figure 3A and 3B ) , whereas the ventral horns of the <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO embryos were devoid of innervation ( Figure 3C ) .
In the <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KOs , DiI-labeled fibers entered the ventral spinal cord , but extended towards the midline instead of the ventral horn ( Figure 3D ) , in a pattern similar to that observed at P0 .
Our data point to a complete absence of proprioceptive innervation of the ventral horn of the <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> null spinal cord throughout the developmental stages investigated .
As the sensory axons never reach motor neuron dendrites in the ventral horn ( Figure S1 ) , the stretch reflex arc circuit is not established .
The failure to initiate contact between sensory axons and motor neurons in the absence of <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> suggests a requirement for <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> for proper axon targeting in addition to a role in sensory axon maintenance .
<termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> Is Required for Proper Peripheral Innervation .
In order to study peripheral innervation in double KO animals , we investigated spindle development in the gastrocnemius muscle .
Muscle spindles could be identified easily in P0 WT and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO animals by their characteristic morphology ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Proprioceptive fibers labeled with neurofilament-M ( NF-M ) antibody formed ring-like spiral endings wrapped around intrafusal bag fibers labeled with S46 antibody , specific for slow developmental myosin heavy chain protein ( Miller et al. 1985 ) .
As reported earlier , there were no muscle spindles in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO animals ( Ernfors et al. 1994 ) .
On the other hand , <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO animals had more spindles than WT , and spindles were in clusters similar to animals over-expressing NT-3 in the muscle ( Wright et al. 1997 ) .
Although <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> - dependent cells were rescued , no muscle spindles were detected in the limbs of double KOs ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Muscle spindles could be observed with TrkC antibody in WT and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO animals , but not in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> or double KOs ( Figure 4E ) .
In both <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> and double KO animals , <termsem="EG:18040"> NF-M </term> - labeled fibers could be detected in muscles , thus the muscles of these animals were not completely devoid of nerve fibers .
Since there were no <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive fibers in these muscles , we think that these <termsem="EG:18040"> NF-M </term> - labeled fibers correspond to motor axons .
Absence of muscle spindles might be due to a failure in initiation of differentiation by proprioceptive axons , or a failure of maturation and maintenance in the absence of <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , we investigated muscle spindle development at E15 and E17 with S46 / <termsem="EG:18040"> NF-M </term> immunostaining as well as DiI labeling .
No structures with the characteristic muscle spindle shape could be detected in any of the genotypes at E15 ( Figure S2 ) .
However , numerous developing spindles could be identified at E17 in WT and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KOs , but not in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO embryos ( Figure 4C ) .
<termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double null muscles were devoid of spindles ( Figure 4C ) , except for one spindle-like structure observed in one leg of an embryo ( Figure 4C , inset , denoted by the asterisk ) .
DiI labeling through the DRGs at E17 yielded similar results , with muscle spindles identified in parallel sections in WT and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> null muscles ( Figure 4D ) , but not in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> or double KO animals .
Although DiI-labeled fibers could be detected in double null muscles , they never formed ring-like structures characteristic of muscle spindles .
We also examined <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> / <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> expression at P0 in the tibial nerve , which carries sensory fibers to the gastrocnemius muscle as well as the skin of the lower leg .
In <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KOs , <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> - positive axons could be seen in the tibial nerve but there were no <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - positive axons ; in contrast , <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> - and <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - labeled axons are both present in WT , <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO , and double KO animals ( Figure 4F ) .
These results suggest that although proprioceptive axons follow proper trajectories in distal peripheral nerves , they fail to innervate their target muscles in the absence of <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> .
NT-3 Is a Chemoattractant for DRG Axons In Vitro .
To test the hypothesis that NT-3 acts as a chemoattractant for sensory axons , we performed a series of in vitro assays .
Proprioceptive axons in mice enter the gray matter in the spinal cord and advance ventrally parallel to the midline by E13 and reach the motor neurons by E15 ( Ozaki and Snider 1994 ) .
We co-cultured collagen-embedded E13 WT DRG explants with NT-3-soaked sepharose beads ( n = 26 ) .
Control cultures were set up using <termsem="EG:280717"> bovine serum albumin </term> ( <termsem="EG:280717"> BSA </term> ) -- or phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) -- soaked beads ( n = 12 ) .
DRG axons began extending towards the localized NT-3 source by the end of the first day and consistently displayed a strong chemoattraction by 3 d in vitro , whereas they did not show such preference for <termsem="EG:280717"> BSA </term> - loaded control beads ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
This attraction was not due to survival support of NT-3 because <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> null ganglia displayed the same chemoattraction ( Figure 5C ; n = 16 ) .
NT-3 may act through either <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> , or the <termsem="EG:18053"> p75NTR </term> .
We repeated the co-culture experiments with DRG explants derived from <termsem="EG:18053"> p75NTR </term> KO mice ( n = 18 ) .
Axons of these ganglia also showed strong chemoattraction towards the NT-3 beads ( Figure 5D ) .
Finally , we used diffusible TrkC receptors conjugated to IgG constant regions ( TrkC-Fc ) added to the medium ( n = 6 ) to deplete soluble NT-3 from the collagen gels ( Figure 5E ) .
In the presence of TrkC-Fc the chemoattraction was completely blocked , demonstrating that the effect we see is specific for NT-3 .
In order to investigate the active range of our beads , we have repeated the cultures with WT E13 DRGs by placing the beads at increasing distances from the ganglia ( n = 4 each ) ( Figure 5F ) .
There was still preferred growth towards the bead at 1,200 m , the longest distance studied , although the number of axons and the extent of growth were not as robust .
Next , we set up E13 DRG spinal cord explant cultures using NT-3-loaded beads placed at the midline at mid-spinal cord level as an ectopic NT-3 source ( n = 15 ) .
Control cultures were set using PBS-loaded beads ( n = 6 ) .
DiI labeling through the DRGs revealed numerous fibers entering the spinal cord at ectopic regions and growing towards the NT-3 beads ( Figure 6A ) , surrounding the beads and forming bundles around them ( Figure 6C -- 6E ) .
In control cultures , all labeled fibers were directed towards the dorsal spinal cord and terminated there , where they normally enter the gray matter at E13 ( Figure 6B ) .
No axons were observed around the PBS-loaded control beads ( Figure 6F ) .
Axons that normally enter the gray matter through dorsal spinal cord grow towards the midline when presented with a localized NT-3 source , and new axon growth towards the NT-3 bead is initiated from DRGs , entering the spinal cord at ectopic loci at lateral mid-spinal cord ( Figure 6G ) .
NT-3 is therefore capable of acting as a chemoattractant for DRG axons .
Relatively few studies have implicated NT-3 as a chemoattractant agent for sensory and motor axons .
Previously noted chemoattractant action of the embryonic mouse maxillary process on trigeminal ganglion neurons ( Lumsden and Davies 1986 ) is now attributed to <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> and <termsem="EG:12064"> brain-derived neurotrophic factor </term> ( <termsem="EG:12064"> BDNF </term> ) ( O'Connor et al. 1999 ) .
Recently , Tucker et al. ( 2001 ) showed that developing sensory and motor axons in limb slice cultures preferentially grow towards neurotrophin-soaked beads instead of following their normal trajectories .
Conversely , beads soaked with neurotrophin function-blocking antibodies led to reduction of sensory and motor axon growth towards the limb .
In transgenic mice , which over-express NT-3 under the nestin promoter in the central nervous system , the course of the proprioceptive afferents are altered and directed towards the regions with high levels of ectopic NT-3 expression in the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ) .
Ringstedt et al. considered the possibility that NT-3 may play a chemoattractant role during the innervation of ventral horns by proprioceptive afferents .
However , earlier findings of normal proprioceptive afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function-blocking NT-3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995 ) led them to discount this possibility .
In that study , though , assays on the effectiveness of antibody perturbation on <termsem="EG:428099"> NT-3 </term> - dependent cell survival showed that effectiveness was significant ( approximately 90 % ) but not complete ( Oakley et al. 1995 ) .
Ringstedt et al. ( 1997 ) argue that while central sensory axons may still navigate properly in the absence of <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> , ectopic expression of NT-3 disrupts their targeting .
Recently , another member of the neurotrophin family , BDNF , has been suggested to act as a chemoattractant for sensory axons innervating ear ( Tessarollo et al. 2004 ) .
In a gene replacement strategy in which BDNF expression was driven by the NT-3 promoter , vestibular axons rerouted towards ectopic sources of BDNF in the cochlea that normally expressed NT-3 and were not innervated by these axons .
Ectopic NT-3 supplied using osmotic pumps and adenovirus-mediated expression induce sensory axon growth during regeneration ( Zhang et al. 1998 , Bradbury et al. 1999 , Oudega et al. 1999 , Ramer et al. 2002 ) , and induce axonal plasticity of corticospinal axons in injured adult spinal cord ( Zhou et al. 2003 ) , where the sprouting axons from the intact site cross the midline towards the NT-3 source on the lesion side of the spinal cord .
Our present results are in agreement with these observations , and provide further evidence that <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> acts as a chemoattractant for sensory afferents .
Previously , normal motor neuron innervation was rescued in NT-3 KO animals by over-expressing NT-3 selectively in their muscles ( Wright et al. 1997 ) .
It appears that peripheral <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> alone is sufficient for rescuing proprioceptive neurons in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO animals and proper axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord .
However , it is unclear whether <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> is absent from the ventral spinal cords of these animals .
The possibility has been raised that motor neurons may retrogradely transport NT-3 in muscle to the spinal cord ( Chen and Frank 1999 ) .
Assays to determine whether any <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> is present in the ventral horns of these mice would be informative .
Recently , Patel et al. ( 2003 ) reported their observations on <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO mice they bred .
Their results are significantly different from ours .
They see no proprioceptive afferents in the periphery of the double knockouts and note that central proprioceptive afferents terminate in the intermediate spinal cord without extending ventrally .
Their observations are based on <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> immunostaining and DiI labeling of the peripheral nerves .
We noted that <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> immunolabeling is diminished in our <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KOs .
In various manipulations of the neurotrophins it has been noted that molecular markers for proprioceptive axons such as <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> or <termsem="EG:12310"> calcitonin gene-related peptide </term> for <termsem="EG:18049"> nerve growth factor </term> -- responsive axons are compromised ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ; Patel et al. 2000 ) , thus <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> immunostaining in <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KOs can not reveal the extent of proprioceptive axons in the periphery .
Seventy-three percent of retrogradely labeled gastrocnemius muscle afferents were reported to be expressing <termsem="EG:29613"> TrkC </term> RNA in the adult rat DRG , although some of these ( about 10 % ) may represent cutaneous innervation ( McMahon et al. 1994 ) .
Presently , it is not clear whether TrkC protein is also made by cutaneous afferents and if so at what stage in development this receptor is expressed by cutaneous axons .
Based on the available evidence showing that all proprioceptive neurons are eliminated in <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> or <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> null mice , we think that <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> staining in the tibial nerve mostly represents proprioceptive axons in the vicinity of their peripheral target .
Altogether , our findings suggest a role for <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> in initiation of muscle innervation and spindle differentiation by the proprioceptive axons .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) examined DiI-labeled central DRG axons in the spinal cord of three E17 and two P0 cases , and report that central proprioceptive axons stop in the intermediate laminae , never entering the ventral cord .
We have examined nine <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO cases , and often incomplete DiI labeling gives the impression that there are no axons reaching the ventral spinal cord .
We have also seen cases similar to theirs ( n = 4 ) , but at higher magnification these axons did not have terminal boutons and were not completely labeled .
However , with complete fills ( n = 5 ) , it was possible to trace these axons into the ventral midline and across to the contralateral side , and visualize terminal boutons at their tips ( see Figure 3C ) .
Previously , Arber et al. ( 2000 ) reported that members of the Ets family of transcription factors , Er81 and Pea3 , are expressed by DRG neurons as well as motor neurons and their target muscle fibers .
They found that in the spinal cord of <termsem="EG:14009"> Er81 </term> KO mice , ventral projections of proprioceptive axons were mostly absent , and very few axons made it to the ventral cord .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) note that the phenotype they observed in their <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO mice is quite similar to that of <termsem="EG:14009"> Er81 </term> KO mice .
They provide evidence that NT-3 induces Er81 expression in DRG explants in vitro .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) report that <termsem="EG:14009"> Er81 </term> mRNA expression is diminished ( but not abolished ) in both <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO and <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO mice , while their immunohistochemistry shows much less protein expression in the double KO mice .
It is highly possible that a small but considerable number of DRG cells express the transcription factor <termsem="EG:14009"> Er81 </term> and that their axons grow beyond the intermediate levels of the spinal cord in <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO mice .
While the phenotype of <termsem="EG:14009"> Er81 </term> KO mice is quite dramatic , and most proprioceptive axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord , it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and target properly to the motor neurons ( Arber et al. 2000 ) .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) also present observations from islet2DTA mice , which lack a significant portion of the motor neurons in the ventral cord .
In these mice <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> immunostaining shows axons in the ventral horns .
Patel et al. argue that since motor neurons are absent in these mice , <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> secreted by them could not be a signal for proprioceptive axons to enter the lateral motor columns .
However , there is no evidence showing that <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> mRNA or protein expressed in the ventral spinal cord is exclusively from motor neurons , and there are no available data indicating that in islet2DTA mice , <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> expression in the ventral spinal cord is abolished ( Yang et al. 2001 ; Pun et al. 2002 ) .
Studies in embryonic mice reported <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> mRNA in the ventral horns of the spinal cord , but it is not definitive that both mRNA and protein are expressed solely by motor neurons .
In the adult spinal cord , while motor neurons express high levels of NT-3 , other cells , including glia , also express it ( Zhou and Rush 1994 ; Dreyfus et al. 1999 ; Buck et al. 2000 ) .
Our present results , along with those from transgenic mice with NT-3 over-expression in ectopic regions of the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ) , argue for a role of NT-3 in chemoattractant axon guidance of proprioceptive axons in the spinal cord .
Finally , in culture assays , we see a strong chemoattraction of DRG neurons to localized sources of NT-3 .
This response is seen in WT , <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> null and in <termsem="EG:18053"> p75 </term> null DRG explants , and in the absence of any other neurotrophins or target-derived axon guidance molecules .
Furthermore , in vitro , sensory axon response to NT-3 does not appear to be dose-dependent ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ; Tucker et al. 2001 ) .
NT-3 is capable of attracting axons along distances of up to 1 mm in collagen gel matrix , covering the physiological range it needs to attract axons during development .
Previous studies with exogenous or local applications of NT-3 to developing primary sensory axons have indicated that this neurotrophin can attract and induce axonal branching ( Ulupnar et al. 2000 ; zdinler and Erzurumlu 2001 , zdinler et al. 2004 ) .
Along the monosynaptic stretch reflex pathway , only Wnt-3 has been implicated as an axon arborization factor in the spinal cord ( Krylova et al. 2002 ) .
Another molecule , Slit2 , expressed in the midline and by motor neurons ( Wang et al. 1999 ) is capable of inducing axonal branching ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al. 2001 ; zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002 ) .
DRG neurons express Robo receptors , which bind to Slits , and proprioceptive axons are therefore capable of responding to Slit signals ( Wang et al. 1999 ) .
Slit2 does not cause repulsion of NT-3-responsive DRG axons in vitro ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al. 2001 ) , but causes ectopic branching and arborization of trigeminal axons in the brainstem ( zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002 ) .
Thus , <termsem="EG:20563"> Slit2 </term> might also be involved in terminal branching of propioceptive axons in the ventral cord and in the midline branching observed in our double KOs .
Lack of <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> expression in <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO mice suggests that <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> expression might be responsible for proper axon targeting and muscle spindle differentiation .
Presently we can not completely rule out this possibility .
However , no defects in axon pathfinding along the monosynaptic reflex arc or in muscle spindle differentiation have been noted in <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> KO mice , which develop normally and show no apparent changes in their behavior or physical activity ( Schwaller et al. 1999 ) .
These observations suggest that axonal targeting defects in <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO mice can not be simply due to lack of <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> expression in proprioceptive cells .
Our present results suggest that <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> acts as a short-range axon guidance cue for proprioceptive axons centrally and peripherally , as they navigate to their targets using other axon guidance cues .
In its absence , these axons terminate in inappropriate loci .
However , <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> may not be the only molecule that plays a role in targeting and terminal branching of sensory axons in the ventral spinal cord .
<termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> most likely acts cooperatively with other axon guidance molecules or by regulating expression of yet to be identified proprioceptive neuron-specific receptors/ligands for numerous axon guidance cues .
Generation of double KOs .
We crossed <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO females on a C57BL/6 background ( Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Maine , United States ) to <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> heterozygote males on a 129 Sv background to generate double heterozygote animals .
Progeny was genotyped with PCR , and animals heterozygous for both genes were bred to obtain the double KOs .
Primers used for the <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> locus were R661 , GTT GAC CAG AGT GGC GTA GG ; R662 , CCG CTT CCA TTG CTC AGC GG ; and R663 , GAG CTG ATC AGA ACC ATC ATG .
Primers used for the <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> locus were NT3A , CGT GGT GAG GTT CTA TTG GCT AC ; NT3B , CAG AGC ACC CTG CCC AAA GCA GAG ; NT3R , CCT TGA CAA TAC TGA ATG CC ; and NEOF , GGG AAC TTC CTG ACT AGG .
WT , <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> KO , and <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> KO littermates were used as controls .
A total of 11 <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> / <termsem="EG:18205"> NT-3 </term> double KO mice were analyzed , of these nine were P0 pups .
The <termsem="EG:18053"> p75 </term> colony on a 129 S1 background was received from Jackson Laboratory .
We used tail DNA to genotype animals using the primers IMR0013 , CTT GGG TGG AGA GGC TAT TC ; IMR0014 , AGG TGA GAT GAC AGG AGA TC ( generic neo primers ) ; IMR0710 , TGT TAC GTT CTC TGA CGT GGT GAG ; and IMR0711 , TCA GCC CAG GGT GTG CAC TC ( <termsem="EG:18053"> p75 </term> locus ) .
For embryonic experiments , day of plug positivity was considered E0 .

<termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> / <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> immunohistochemistry .
Frozen spinal cord sections ( 10 m thick ) were blocked and incubated in a cocktail of rabbit anti-TrkA and goat anti-TrkC antibodies ( gift of Dr. Reichardt ; Huang et al. 1999 ) , followed by a cocktail of CY3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and FITC conjugated donkey anti-goat antibodies ( Chemicon , Temecula , California , United States ) in the presence of 0.3 % TritonX-100 and 10 % normal donkey serum .
For <termsem="EG:19293"> PV </term> immunohistochemistry , sections were reacted with monoclonal mouse anti-PV antibody ( Sigma , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) , and developed by Vector fluorescein mouse on mouse kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , California , United States ) .
For quantification purposes , <termsem="EG:18211"> TrkA </term> - and <termsem="EG:18213"> TrkC </term> - labeled cells from four different DRGs of each genotype and age studied were counted , and ratios plotted .
Muscle spindle detection .
Gastrocnemius muscle was dissected out in P0 pups and sectioned longitudinally , or , in some cases , the whole leg at the level of gastrocnemius muscle with tibial nerve was sectioned in cross section .
Sections were incubated with monoclonal S46 antibody ( gift of Dr. Stockdale ) reactive to the spindle-specific slow-tonic myosin heavy chain isoform and developed by Vector mouse on mouse kit as described above , followed by rabbit anti-NF-M antibody ( Chemicon ) and CY3 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Chemicon ) in a sequential double-labeling protocol .
In another method , DiI crystals were placed in DRGs of E17 embryos from different genotypes ( n = 2 ) , and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated and sectioned into 40-m-thick slices on a vibratome .
DiI labeling .
Spinal cords were dissected out with the DRGs attached , motor root was cut to prevent backfilling of motor neurons , and crystals of 1,1  - dioctadecyl-3,3,3  ,3  - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiI ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , Oregon , United States ) were inserted in DRGs .
Labeled spinal cords were incubated at 37 C for 8 d and sectioned on a vibrotome at 100 m .
Sections were observed under the fluorescent microscope and photographed , and images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop , inverted , and adjusted for brightness and contrast .
Photoconverted in 0.15 % DAB ( 3,3  - diaminobenzidine ; Sigma ) in 0.1 M Tris buffer ( pH 8.2 ) .
In vitro co-culture assay .
DRG explants were derived from Swiss Webster , <termsem="EG:12028"> Bax </term> null , and <termsem="EG:18053"> p75 </term> null mouse embryos ( E13 ) .
For collagen matrix assays , DRGs were dissected out under a stereomicroscope using tungsten needles .
Collagen matrix was prepared with 430 l of collagen ( 3 mg/ml dissolved in 0.1 M acetic acid , Sigma ) , 50 l of 10X DMEM medium , and 2.5 l of 0.8 M NaCa2 , and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 .
Individual ganglion explants were placed in 24-well plates and covered with freshly prepared collagen .
Sepharose beads with an average diameter of 150 m were used .
Beads were washed twice with PBS , air dried , and loaded with 10 , 20 , 50 , or 100 ng/l NT-3 ( Collaborative Research , Chemicon ) at 4 C overnight with constant shaking .
For negative control , beads were loaded with <termsem="EG:280717"> BSA </term> ( 10 -- 100 ng/l ) or PBS .
Either a single neurotrophin-loaded bead or a single <termsem="EG:280717"> BSA </term> ( or PBS ) -- loaded bead was implanted about 200 -- 1,200 m away from the ganglion explant .
Collagen-embedded cultures were then placed at 33 C for 15 min for the matrix to harden .
Serum-free culture medium was then added to each well .
In cultures with WT DRG and control beads , 10 % serum was added to ensure viability of the explants .
TrkC-Fc ( Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Tarrytown , New York , United States ) was added ( 20 g/ml ) into the culture medium .
Spinal cords with attached DRGs were dissected out from Swiss Webster mouse embryos at E13 , and sectioned into 300-m-thick slices .
Tissue slices were placed on Millicell Tissue Culture Inserts ( Millipore , Billrica , Massachusetts , United States ) .
NT-3-loaded ( n = 15 ) or PBS-loaded ( n = 6 ) sepharose beads were prepared as described above , and placed in the midline at mid-spinal cord level .
Inserts were placed in six-well plates with serum-free medium at the bottom of the wells , and kept at 33 C for 3 d in the presence of 5 % CO2 .
Cultures were then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , and small crystals of DiI were placed into the DRGs .
Samples were incubated in a 37 - C incubator , allowing the dye to diffuse , and photographed under a Nikon ( Tokyo , Japan ) inverted epifluoresence microscope .

( G ) Summary of our observations from E13 spinal cord DRG organotypic cultures .
In control cultures fibers extend along the dorsal spinal cord , where they normally enter the gray matter at E13 .
In the presence of an ectopic NT-3 source localized at the midline , these axons grow towards the NT-3 bead .
NT-3 also initiates axon growth from the DRGs , entering the spinal cord at ectopic lateral loci , growing towards the bead , surrounding the bead , forming nerve bundles , and branching around it .
