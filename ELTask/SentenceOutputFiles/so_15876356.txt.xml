Ataxia and peripheral nerve hypomyelination in ADAM22-deficient mice .
ADAM22 is a member of the ADAM <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family , but the fact that it is expressed only in the nervous systems makes it unique .
ADAM22 's <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity to other ADAMs suggests it to be an integrin binder and thus to have a role in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions .
To elucidate the physiological functions of ADAM22 , we employed <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting to generate ADAM22 knockout mice .
ADAM22-deficient mice were produced in a good accordance with the Mendelian ratio and appeared normal at birth .
After one week , severe ataxia was observed , and all homozygotes died before weaning , probably due to convulsions .
No major histological abnormalities were detected in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum of the homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> ; however , marked hypomyelination of the peripheral nerves was observed .
The results of our study demonstrate that ADAM22 is closely involved in the correct functioning of the nervous system .
Further analysis of ADAM22 will provide clues to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases such as epileptic seizures and peripheral neuropathy .
ADAM ( A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease ) is a family of membrane-spanning multi - <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> proteins containing a metalloproteinase-like <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and a disintegrin-like <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
Currently , more than 30 ADAMs have been identified in mammals .
Their biological activities implicate ADAMs in fertilization , myogenesis and neurogenesis by proteolysis and adhesion .
Some types of ADAM are catalytically active metalloproteases and shed the extracellular <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> of membrane-bound growth factors or receptors [ 1,2 ] .
For example , ADAM17 ( TACE ) has been shown to cleave several substrates , including tumour necrosis factor alpha [ 3,4 ] , heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor [ 6,7 ] and transforming growth factor alpha [ 8 ] .
Studies of ADAM17-null mice have revealed that ADAM17 is critical in embryogenesis and plays an essential role in the supply of growth factors [ 6,8 ] .
ADAMs are also involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion through their interaction with integrins or syndecans .
More than 10 ADAMs have been shown to support integrin-mediated cell adhesion in vitro [ 9 ] .
It has been reported that ADAM2-null and ADAM3-null male <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> are infertile and their spermatozoa lack egg-binding abilities [ 10-12 ] .
Both ADAM2 and ADAM3 are not metalloproteases because they lack catalytic site <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in their metalloprotease <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
These studies clearly showed that non-proteinase members of ADAMs also have significant roles in vivo .
We have reported the findings of ADAM11 , ADAM22 and ADAM23 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and their restricted expression in the human and murine nervous systems [ 13-15 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> analysis suggests that they are not metalloproteases , since they all lack a catalytic motif .
It has been reported that ADAM23 protein is localised to the cell surface [ 16 ] , interacts with alpha-v beta-3 integrin heterodimer [ 17 ] and the disruption of ADAM23 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in the mouse results in premature death associated with ataxia and tremor [ 18 ] .
Although the cause of death in this mouse is unknown , for these phenotypes , impaired cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions in the nervous system caused by loss of ADAM23 may be responsible .
ADAM22 and ADAM23 share highly <termsem="SO:0000853"> <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> sequences </term> in their extracellular <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> .
Especially , it is evident in their putative integrin binding loop <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> , CR ( <termsem="SO:0001454"> E </term> / <termsem="SO:0001453"> D </term> ) AVN ( <termsem="SO:0001454"> E </term> / <termsem="SO:0001453"> D </term> ) CD , which is located centre of the disintegrin <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
These findings led us to hypothesize that ADAM22 is an integrin binder and plays an important role in the nervous system , as does ADAM23 .
To determine the physiological functions of ADAM22 , we generated and analysed Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice .
Generation of ADAM22-deficient mice .
Mice carrying a targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in their Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> were generated by homologous recombination ( Fig. 1A ) .
Correct targeting events were confirmed by Southern blot analysis ( Fig. 1B ) .
Since the <termsem="SO:0000319"> termination codon </term> was <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduced </term> in <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 8 in the <termsem="SO:0001062"> pro-protein </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , only the truncated <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> of the ADAM22 protein would be synthesized from this targeted <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
Because a <termsem="SO:0001062"> pro-protein </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> is always <termsem="SO:0000045"> removed </term> in the mature functional ADAM-proteins by the Furin-like proteases and is thought to be non-functional itself , we considered that this truncated <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> of ADAM22 protein has no function .
Absence of mature ADAM22 protein in homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the specific antibody , which recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of the ADAM22 protein ( Fig. 1C ) .
Homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> showed no noticeable defects at birth and were indistinguishable from <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> or heterozygous littermates during the first week .
At postnatal day 10 ( P10 ) , most of the homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> were distinguishable by abnormalities such as reduced body weight and uncoordinated movements of their limbs .
After P10 , all homozygotes displayed severe ataxia ( Fig. 2 ) and began to die .
To measure the survival rate and body weight of each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> precisely , we backcrossed heterozygous male <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> to C57BL/6 females more than 6 times .
The resulting ( N 6 ) heterozygous males and females were intercrossed and the produced offspring were analysed .
The numbers of survivors of each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> every 5 days are shown in Table 1 .
At P10 , the ratio of each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> was in close accordance with the Mendelian ratio ( 20.5 % <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> , 55.1 % <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / - , 24.4 % - / - ; n = 78 ) .
This result shows that ADAM22 is not essential for embryogenesis .
At P10 , the average body weight of homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> was approximately half that of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and heterozygous littermates ( Table 2 ) .
Homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> died one by one after P10 , and all homozygotes died before P20 .
Of more than 100 homozygotes we have produced , none have survived more than 25 days after birth .
Meanwhile , heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> looked normal , were fertile , and survived for more than one year without obvious defects .
Histopathology of ADAM22-deficient mice .
We have reported the predominant expression of ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> in the human and mouse brain by Northern blot analysis [ 13,14 ] .
To determine the distribution of ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> in the adult mouse CNS precisely , in situ hybridisation analysis was performed using 35S-labeled <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> .
As shown in Fig. 3 , ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> was expressed throughout the adult mouse CNS .
Strong signal was detected in the cerebellar granule cells and hippocampal formation .
In the spinal cord , hybridisation signal was restricted to the grey matter .
The distribution of ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> in the CNS was quite similar with that of ADAM11 , whose neuronal expression has been reported [ 19 ] .
These results suggest that the ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> expression is neuronal in the mouse CNS .
Based on the <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> distribution pattern , we performed immunohistopathological analysis of the cerebellum and hippocampus extensively .
Despite the high level of expression of ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNAs </term> in the cerebellar granule cells , granule cell layer was normally formed and Purkinje cell morphology ( calbindin-staining ) of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mouse looked intact ( Figs. 4A -- D ) .
Hippocampal formation was also normally formed ( Figs. 4I -- J ) .
These results suggest that neuronal cell migration was not impaired in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mouse .
Myelin-formation detected by MBP ( myelin basic protein ) staining of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> in the cerebellum ( Fig. 4H ) and spinal cord ( Fig. 4L ) was also indistinguishable with the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> littermate ( Figs. 4G , K ) .
In summary , we could not find any signs of abnormalities in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mouse brain by the light microscopic examination .
Next , the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> were analysed by toluidine blue stain , which reveals myelin formation .
Surprisingly , lack of myelin or thin myelin was observed in the sciatic nerves ( Fig. 5B ) and trigeminal nerves ( Fig. 5D ) in homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> .
Because no lesions were observed in the spinal cord ( Fig. 5F ) , it was suggested that Schwann cell specific myelination defect occurred in the homozygous mice .
To analyse the state of myelinating Schwann cells and axons , electron microscopic ( EM ) analysis of the sciatic nerve was performed ( Fig. 6 ) .
Schwann cells formed thin or no myelin in the homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> ( Fig. 6B ) .
In contrast , heterozygous mice showed complete myelination ( Fig. 6A ) .
Morphology of the axons looked normal in each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> .
Immunohistochemical analysis of the sciatic nerve showed that increased number of nuclei ( Fig. 7B ) and reduced staining of MBP ( Fig. 7D ) were remarkable in the homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutant </term> </term> .
The Schwann cell marker , S100 staining signal was intensely observed in the homozygote as well as <termsem="SO:0000817"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> wild-type </term> </term> ( Figs. 7E , F ) .
These results suggest that proliferation of the Schwann cells was not impaired but differentiation is severely delayed in the ADAM22-deficient mice .
Novel ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> isolated from the peripheral nervous system .
In the case of human ADAM22 , isolation of five <termsem="SO:1001187"> splicing variants </term> and existence of two terminating <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> have been reported [ 13,20,21 ] .
However , the latter terminating <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 31 ) of the mouse species has not been identified yet .
To isolate the long <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> of mouse ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> , at first , we sought the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> by BLAST <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> search .
Search results showed that the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> <termsem="SO:0000149"> contig </term> NT_039297 contained most of the mouse Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
In this <termsem="SO:0000149"> contig sequence </term> , we found putative <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 30 and 31 , those <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> were quite similar to human ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> 1 ( GenBank # NM_021723 ) .
To confirm existence of <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> , we designed <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> on the putative <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 31 and performed RT-PCR using mouse cerebellum <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> as a template .
TA-cloning of the amplified <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> and sequencing analysis showed that 5 of 8 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were type 1 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> ( G01 ) , 2 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were type 3 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> ( G03 ) and 1 <termsem="SO:0000151"> clone </term> ( G08 ) contained a novel <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> between <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 29 and 30 .
Next , we performed RT-PCR analysis of <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNAs </term> purified from several adult mouse tissues , such as the spinal cord , dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) , sciatic nerve and cultured primary Schwann cells .
Interestingly , multiple <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> were amplified from each tissue ( Fig. 8 ) , and length of major <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> in each lane was different .
For example , length of major amplified PCR <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> from the sciatic nerve ( Fig. 8A , lane 5 ) and cultured Schwann cells ( lane 6 ) were almost identical , and were shorter than those from other tissues .
In contrast , major <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> from the DRG ( lane 4 ) were longer than others .
We performed TA-cloning and sequencing to analyse <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> organization of the amplified <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> ( Fig. 8C ) .
Forty seven <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> were isolated in total and were classified in 16 independent <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> ( G01 -- G23 ) .
Comparison with the <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequence </term> revealed the existence of 8 novel <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 27S , 27L , 29.1 , 29.3 , 29.5 , 29.7 , 30 and 31 ) .
These novel <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> were <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by well-defined <termsem="SO:0000188"> introns </term> that obey the GT-AG rule .
<termsem="SO:0000147"> Exon </term> organization of each <termsem="SO:0000151"> clone </term> was shown in Fig. 8C .
Characteristic <termsem="SO:0000110"> feature </term> of ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> is tissue specific <termsem="SO:0000046"> insertion </term> or skipping of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> .
Because the number of <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotides </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 26 , 27 , 27L , 29.3 , 29.5 and 29.7 is a multiple of 3 , <termsem="SO:0000046"> insertion </term> or skipping of these <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> will not <termsem="SO:0000041"> change </term> the downstream <termsem="SO:0000717"> reading frame </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000906"> Known </term> <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptide </term> motives were not found in the newly isolated <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> .
This RT-PCR analysis is summarized as follows : ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> were roughly subdivided in 3 groups , CNS - <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> ( containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 27 ) , DRG - <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> ( containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 27L ) and Schwann-cell - <termsem="SO:0001060"> form </term> ( skipping <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 26 and 27 ) .
From these results , we concluded that ADAM22 is expressed in a cell-type specific manner , and plays an essential role in myelinogenesis in the PNS .
In the present study , we examined the function of ADAM22 by generating mice that lacked the Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
ADAM22-deficient mice exhibited severe ataxia and premature death .
In contrast , heterozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> were healthy , fertile and survived more than 1 year without obvious abnormalities .
The cause of death in the homozygous <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> is not clear ; however , it is likely to be due to multiple seizures .
This is because convulsive seizures were occasionally observed in homozygotes , after which the suffered mice appeared exhausted and , in most cases , died on the next day .
It is known that cortical dysplasia resulting from aberrant brain development causes seizure syndrome [ 22 ] .
For example , mice lacking the neuron-specific activator of cyclin 5 , p35 , exhibit seizures and a severe neuronal migration defect [ 23 ] .
Because ADAM22 protein is expressed on the cell surface and is likely to be involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions , we hypothesized that depletion of ADAM22 would generate aberrant neuronal migration .
Histochemical analysis was performed to verify this hypothesis .
However , no marked abnormalities were observed in the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mouse brain , ruling out a critical role for ADAM22 in neuronal migration .
Another possible explanation is that the premature death in first 2 weeks of life is caused by the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system .
Especially , nerves which control the breathing would be very important , because the respiration system undergoes significant maturation in the first 2 -- 3 weeks after birth .
For example , the myelin-deficient ( MD ) rat , which carries a <termsem="SO:1000008"> point mutation </term> in the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , exhibits ataxia , tremor , dysmyelination and dies at approximately postnatal day 21 .
In MD rat , early death is caused by the dysfunction of the brain stem which is essential for autonomic control of respiration during hypoxia [ 24 ] .
Further study is needed to verify the cause of death in ADAM22-deficient mice .
Another interesting phenotype observed in ADAM22-deficient mice was hypomyelinogenesis .
Histopathological analysis revealed marked hypomyelination in the sciatic and trigeminal nerves .
However , myelin formation in the spinal cord and the brain was normal .
It was therefore evident that hypomyelinogenesis occurred specifically in the peripheral nerves in the knockout mice , suggesting Schwann cell dysfunction .
In the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> sciatic nerve , the density of pro-myelinating Schwann cells ( S100-positive , MBP-negative ) was markedly higher than that seen in heterozygotes .
Higher pro-myelinating Schwann cell density and marked delay in myelin formation indicate that ADAM22 plays an important role in Schwann cell differentiation , but not in proliferation .
Investigations on why hypomyelinogenesis occurred in ADAM22-deficient mice centre on integrin .
This is because several ADAMs have been shown to interact with integrins via disintegrin <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> [ 9 ] , and it has been suggested that alpha-6 beta-1 integrin on the Schwann cell plays an important role in myelin formation [ 25 ] .
In addition , laminin-2 is a key player in peripheral myelin formation , because laminin-2 deficiency causes dysmyelination in mice and humans , and its receptors , alpha-6 beta-1 integrin and dystroglycan , are also shown to be deeply involved in myelin formation [ 26,27 ] .
The conditional knockout studies of beta-1 integrin and laminin gamma-1 in Schwann cell suggested that both laminin-2 and integrins are essential for segregation of large bundles of axons in the early stage of myelin formation [ 25,28 ] .
In contrast , the phenotype seen in the ADAM22-deficient mice was quite different : for example , unsorted bundles of axons were not seen in nerves and roots .
We assume that ADAM22 partially modulates integrin-mediated signals or is involved at a later stage of myelin formation .
In summary , we generated ADAM22-deficient mice and proved that ADAM22 plays an essential role in both the CNS and the PNS .
The results of this study suggest that ADAM22 is involved in human diseases such as epilepsy and peripheral neuropathy .
The human ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is relatively large , at 300 kb in length , and is comprised of more than 30 <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> .
It is assigned on 7q21 , where several <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> aberrations that are accompanied by neurological disorders have been identified [ 29,30 ] .
Further detailed molecular function analysis of ADAM22 may lead to progress in uncovering the mechanisms that underlie certain human neurological diseases .
Construction of an Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> .
The 18-kb <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> covering <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 of the Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> were amplified from C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> by PCR using Expand Hi-Fidelity <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> mix ( Roche Diagnostics ) and <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> <termsem="SO:0000546"> designed </term> for each <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> .
To generate a <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the mouse Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , we <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> the PGKneo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> into <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 8 of the Adam22 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
The final targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> consisted of a 10.5-kb <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> that was interrupted by the <termsem="SO:0000046"> insertion </term> of the PGKneo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> and contained a MC1/TK <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> as a negative selection marker against random <termsem="SO:0000046"> integration </term> [ 5 ] .
Generation of Adam22 deficient mice .
The linearised targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> was electroporated into TT2 embryonic stem ( ES ) cells [ 31 ] .
Homologous recombinants were selected by PCR .
The extracted <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> from each <termsem="SO:0000151"> clone </term> was amplified using the <termsem="SO:0000121"> <termsem="SO:0001030"> forward </term> primer </term> AGN2 : 5 ' - GCCTGCTTGCCGAATATCATGGTGGAAAAT-3 ' in the PGKneo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> , and the <termsem="SO:0000132"> <termsem="SO:0001031"> reverse </term> primer </term> MFP065R : 5 ' - ACTATTTCTGTGATGAGGGCACAGCATC-3 ' outside the targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> .
Homologous recombined <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> was efficiently amplified by 35 cycles of the following amplification steps ( 94 C -30 s and 68 C -5 min ) .
The targeting efficiency of this <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> was about 4 % .
Correctly targeted ES clones were injected into fertilized ICR mouse eggs at the eight-cell stage .
The resulting male chimeras were mated with C57BL/6N females , and heterozygous male and female mice were interbred to generate homozygous mice .
The ataxic phenotypes of homozygous mice were observed in two independent lines .
Mouse <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> used for Southern blot analysis was extracted from the liver of each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> .
BamHI-digested <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> was probed with the [ 32P ] - labelled 0.4-kb SpeI-BamHI <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> , which is located between <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 8 and 9 .
His-tagged and MBP-fused recombinant protein containing cytoplasmic <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( cp ) of human ADAM22 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> 1 ( <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> : 756 -- 906 , 151 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> in length ) were produced in E. coli .
His-tagged ADAM22-cp protein was purified in denatured condition using Ni-NTA resin ( Qiagen GmbH ) and dialysed in PBS .
Precipitated protein was recovered and was mixed with Freund 's complete adjuvant ( Invitrogen ) , then , the mixture was used for immunization of rabbits .
The antiserum raised against the His-tagged ADAM22-cp protein was incubated with MBP-fused ADAM22-cp protein coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads ( Bio-Rad ) .
Beads with bound antibodies were washed in PBS , and the bound antibodies were eluted with 100 mM glycine , pH 3.0 , and neutralized immediately .
Using the affinity purified antibody , both human and mouse ADAM22 proteins were detected by Western blot analysis .
However , unfortunately the antibody was not suitable for immunohistochemical analysis of mouse tissues .
The absence of ADAM22 protein in the Adam22 - / - mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis .
Briefly , the cerebellum was isolated from a P14 .5 mouse of each <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in cell lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % NP-40 , Complete protease inhibitors [ Roche Diagnostics ] ) .
After removal of cell debris by centrifugation , the supernatant was separated on 10 % SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
The blot was then incubated with polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of ADAM22 ( at 1:1,000 ) .
Bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-labelled second antibody and a ECL-plus chemiluminescence detection system ( Amersham Biosciences Corp. ) .
Primary Schwann cell culture .
Primary Schwann cells were prepared from 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice according to Manent 's protocol [ 32 ] with minor modifications .
Briefly , sciatic nerves were removed and incubated for 7 days in the pre-treatment medium , which consisted of D-MEM ( high glucose ) supplemented with 10 % FCS , 50 mg/ml gentamicin ( Invitrogen Corp. ) , 2.5 g/ml fungizone ( Invitrogen Corp. ) , 2 M forskolin ( EMD Biosciences Inc. ) and 10 ng/ml recombinant heregulin-beta1 ( R&D Systems ) .
For dissociation , cultured sciatic nerves were cut into pieces and incubated at 37 C for 3 hours in Opti-MEM medium ( Invitrogen Corp. ) containing 130 U/ml collagenase type I ( Invitrogen Corp. ) and 0.4 U/ml dispase II ( Roche Diagnostics ) .
Dissociated cells were resuspended in the pre-treatment medium and plated on Poly-D-Lysine/Laminin coated plate ( BD Biosciences ) .
The purity of the cultured Schwann cells , as determined by indirect immunofluorescence analysis , approached 90 % .
Adult C57BL/6 male mice were used in this study .
