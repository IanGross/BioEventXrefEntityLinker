Two major branches of anti- <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> defense in the mouse : MTF-1 / metallothioneins and <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> .
<termsem="CHEBI:33521"> Metal </term> - responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF-1 ) regulates expression of its target genes in response to various stress conditions , notably heavy <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> load , via binding to <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> response elements ( MREs ) in the respective enhancer/promoter regions .
Furthermore , it serves a vital function in embryonic liver development .
However , targeted deletion of Mtf1 in the liver after birth is no longer lethal .
For this study , Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates were both mock - or <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated and liver-specific transcription was analyzed .
Besides the well-characterized metallothionein genes , several new MTF-1 target genes with MRE motifs in the promoter region emerged .
MTF-1 is required for the basal expression of selenoprotein W , muscle 1 gene ( Sepw1 ) that encodes a <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> - binding and putative <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> , supporting a role of MTF-1 in the oxidative stress response .
Furthermore , MTF-1 mediates the <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 ( Ndrg1 ) , which is induced by several stress conditions and is overexpressed in many cancers .
MTF-1 is also involved in the <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> response of <termsem="CHEBI:32460"> cysteine </term> - and <termsem="CHEBI:29947"> glycine </term> - rich <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> 1 gene ( Csrp1 ) , which is implicated in cytoskeletal organization .
In contrast , MTF-1 represses the basal expression of Slc39a10 , a putative <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> transporter .
In a pathway independent of MTF-1 , <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> also induced the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis and regeneration of <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> , a <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - binding <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> .
These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti- <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> defense , one via MTF-1 and its target genes , notably metallothioneins , the other via <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> , with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W. All organisms have evolved mechanisms to cope with a variety of stress situations .
One type of stress response is triggered by heavy <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metals </term> , such as <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:28694"> copper </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> ( for convenience , the terms <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:28694"> copper </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> are also used here to denote <termsem="CHEBI:29105"> Zn2 + </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:29036"> Cu2 + </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:48775"> Cd2 + </term> , respectively ) .
Metallothioneins ( MTs ) , small , <termsem="CHEBI:32460"> cysteine </term> - rich <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , play an important role in <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> homeostasis and detoxification due to their ability to bind different heavy <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ions </term> ( 1 -- 3 ) .
In the mouse , there are four metallothionein genes , designated as Mt1 to Mt4 .
Basal , as well as heavy <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> - induced , expression of Mt1 and Mt2 is mediated by <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> - responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF-1 ) ( 4 -- 7 ) .
This <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> finger <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> recognizes short cis-acting DNA sequences , termed <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> response elements ( MREs ; core consensus sequence TGCRCNC ) , which are present in the promoters of target genes ( 8,9 ) .
MTF-1 is conserved in evolution , and homologs have been characterized in the mouse ( 10 ) , humans ( 11 ) , Drosophila ( 12 -- 14 ) and fish ( 15,16 ) .
The role of MTF-1 has been studied most extensively in the mouse .
Besides coping with heavy <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> load , MTF-1 can also mediate the induction of Mt genes in response to other stress situations , such as oxidative stress ( 5,17 ) and hypoxia ( 18 ) .
In addition , it is required for the metalloregulation of Znt1 , encoding the major plasma membrane-localized <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> efflux transporter ( 19 ) , the hypoxic/anoxic induction of the gene for placental growth factor ( Plgf ) , an angiogenic <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family ( 20 ) , and has recently been invoked in tumor development ( 21,22 ) .
Furthermore , MTF-1 has an essential function during embryogenesis : targeted disruption of Mtf1 results in embryonic lethality around 14 days post coitum due to hepatocyte necrosis ( 23 ) .
In contrast , mice with null mutations for the stress-inducible metallothionein genes ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) are viable , though sensitive to <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> ( 24,25 ) , indicating that additional important MTF-1 target genes are involved in the lethal phenotype .
With the Cre-loxP conditional knockout technique , it is possible to circumvent the embryonic lethal phenotype of conventional Mtf1 knockout mice .
Previous experiments with this technique revealed that deletion of Mtf1 from the liver after birth is no longer lethal under non-stress conditions ( 26 ) .
For this study , an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout mouse line was generated to perform a search for MTF-1 target genes and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - inducible genes in the adult liver .
A number of target gene candidates emerged upon a transcriptome analysis of mock - and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates and several of these were confirmed by semiquantitative RT -- PCR .
Besides the stress-inducible metallothionein genes that were already known as target genes of MTF-1 , we find that MTF-1 is important for basal liver expression of the gene for selenoprotein W , muscle 1 ( Sepw1 ) as well as for <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 ( Ndrg1 ) and the gene encoding <termsem="CHEBI:32460"> cysteine </term> - and <termsem="CHEBI:29947"> glycine </term> - rich <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> 1 ( Csrp1 ) .
In addition , MTF-1 appears to repress the expression of solute carrier family 39 , member 10 gene ( Slc39a10 ) , which encodes a putative <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ion </term> transporter .
In an MTF-1-independent transcriptome response , several genes involved in <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> metabolism are induced .
Further studies confirmed a dual anti- <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> defense , one via <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> and another one via MTF-1 and its target genes , including metallothioneins .
Generation of Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and liver-specific deletion .
Mtf1 conditional knockout mice were generated in collaboration with Dr Michael Leviten ( San Carlos , CA ) .
Two genomic clones containing exons 3 to 6 of Mtf1 were used to construct a gene targeting vector for homologous recombination ( Supplementary Data ) .
A <termsem="CHEBI:44577"> neomycin </term> resistance cassette ( PGK-neo ) flanked by two loxP sites was cloned into the SacI site 5  of exon 3 of Mtf1 , the third loxP site was cloned into the ScaI site 3  of exon 4 .
A <termsem="CHEBI:17748"> thymidine </term> kinase ( TK ) cassette was inserted in the HpaI site 3  of exon 6 .
129 ES cells were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector , selected in the presence of G418 and FIAU , and screened for correct integration events by PCR and Southern blot analysis .
Transient expression of Cre recombinase led to removal of the PGK-neo cassette , and mice carrying the modified Mtf1loxP allele were generated by injection of positive clones into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and subsequent crosses .
Homozygous conditional knockout animals ( Mtf1loxP/loxP ) were crossed with the Cre recombinase transgenic line Mx-cre ( a gift from Prof. Michel Aguet ) to obtain an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout line .
The mice were genotyped by PCR using the following primers ( Microsynth ) : Cre recombinase : 5  - CTATCCAGCAACATTTGGGCCAGC-3  ; 5  - CCAGGTTACGGATATAGTTCATGAC-3  , Mtf1loxP or wild-type allele : 5  - CACACCCAGTTTGTGTATGTCTTC-3  ; 5  - CAGTCACAAGCAAATTACCAAACACTGCC-3  .
At 8 weeks of age , male Mtf1loxP/loxP mice harboring the Mx-cre transgene ( Mtf1loxP/loxP Mx-cre , abbr. : Mtf1Mx-cre ) and control littermates without transgene ( Mtf1loxP/loxP , abbr. : Mtf1loxP ) received four intraperitoneal injections each of 300 g synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic -- polycytidylic <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> [ pI -- pC ; Sigma ; in a volume of 60 l <termsem="CHEBI:26020"> <termsem="CHEBI:35780"> phosphate </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:35225"> buffered </term> saline ( PBS ) ] at 3 day intervals .
Only in the case of DNA-binding studies with MRE sequences from MTF-1 target gene candidates , the control mice received no pI -- pC injections .
For experiments with <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> treatment , mice received 2 days after the last pI -- pC treatment a subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection of either 20 mol/kg body weight CdSO4 ( 2 mM CdSO4 in <termsem="CHEBI:15377"> H2O </term> ; <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> treatment ) or 10 ml/kg body weight <termsem="CHEBI:15377"> H2O </term> ( mock treatment ) 6 h before sacrificing them .
Microarray analysis and data processing .
Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment ; all male ) essentially as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 27 ) .
Gene expression analysis was performed in the Functional Genomics Center Zurich using GeneChip  Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays ( Affymetrix ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and the following <termsem="CHEBI:33893"> reagents </term> and conditions .
cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript  Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Invitrogen ) , using 15 g total RNA .
In vitro transcription was performed with BioArray  High Yield  RNA Transcript Labeling Kit ( Enzo ) and 3.5 to 6 g of each cDNA .
Clean-up of both cDNA and cRNA samples was done using GeneChip  Sample Clean-up Module ( Affymetrix ) .
For the automated washing and staining in the Affymetrix fluidics station 450 , the protocol EukGE-Ws2v4_450 was used .
The probe arrays were scanned with the Affymetrix GS 3000 scanner .
Raw data are available at ArrayExpress ( , accession number E-MEXP-438 ) .
Data analysis was performed with GeneSpring 6.1 software ( Silicon Genetics ) , applying a significance level P  0.05 .
Furthermore , multiple testing correction was used in addition to obtain <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - responsive , MTF-1-independent genes .
Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if there was at least a 2-fold difference in expression levels of the compared experimental groups ( genotype and respective treatment ) .
The result was considered reliable if signal values for the respective gene were scored ` present ' at least for all mice in one experimental group or for two mice in each of two groups .
To screen for the presence of the MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC in the promoter region , the upstream sequences of the respective genes were obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) Genome Browser Database ( ; October/November 2004 ) ( 28 ) .
All RT -- PCRs were performed with QIAGEN  OneStep RT -- PCR Kit ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using 150 -- 200 ng DNase I-digested total RNA ( RNA isolation see microarray analysis ) .
The reactions were carried out using the following primers : Csrp1 : 5  - TTCCGATGTGCCAAGTGTGGC-3  ; 5  - AGTAGAGAGTGGACATTCAGC-3  , <termsem="CHEBI:17368"> hypoxanthin </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:16235"> guanin </term> - phosphoribosyltransferase ( Hprt ) : 5  - GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCTCG-3  ; 5  - CCACAGGACTAGGACACCTGC-3  , Mtf1 : 5  - GTGACTTTTGAGACTGTACTGAGTG-3  ; 5  - CATGCCAAGAAACATTGAAGGTG-3  , Ndrg1 : 5  - AGATACACAACAACGTGGAGG-3  ; 5  - TGTGCGAGCGGCTTCGGGGGC-3  , Sepw1 : 5  - TAGAGGCAGGGTCCTGAAAGC-3  ; 5  - ACACCTGGAAACATGGCTGCC-3  , Slc39a10 : 5  - GCTGTGGCTGGTAGTAAAAGC-3  ; 5  - GTGGCATGGGATGTAAACAGC-3  .
S1 nuclease mapping of transcripts ( S1 analysis ) .
S1 analysis was performed as previously described ( 29 ) , using 100 g DNase I-digested total RNA ( RNA isolation see microarray analysis ) .
The gels were developed using PhosphorImager ( <termsem="CHEBI:23367"> Molecular </term> Dynamics ) .
S1 analysis was done with the following <termsem="CHEBI:37972"> 32P </term> - labeled oligonucleotides : Hprt S1 : 5  - TCTTCAGTCTGATAAAATCTACAGTCATAGGAATGGATCTATCACTATTTCTATTCAGTGATTACATTAAAG-3  , Sepw1 S1 : 5  - TTCAACCGGGAACACCTGGAAACATGGCTGCCTGTCTTCTTGAAGTCTTGAGGTGGAAAGGGAAAGCAAAGCAGGAGGGTTTTCCCACCC-3  .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:36080"> Protein </term> was extracted from liver tissue with T-PER  Tissue <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> Protein </term> Extraction <termsem="CHEBI:33893"> Reagent </term> ( Pierce ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using a 1:10 ratio of mouse tissue ( mg ) to T-PER <termsem="CHEBI:33893"> reagent </term> ( l ) .
EMSA was essentially performed as previously described ( 10 ) .
All binding reactions were carried out by incubating 2 -- 5 fmol <termsem="CHEBI:37972"> 32P </term> - end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides with 100 to 130 g liver <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract .
For competition experiments , 5 pmol of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction before addition of the extract .
All EMSA gels were developed using PhosphorImager ( <termsem="CHEBI:23367"> Molecular </term> Dynamics ) .
The following oligonucleotides were annealed and used for the reactions : Csrp1 MRE1 : 5  - GGAAACAAAACGGCGCGCACTCCGGCGC-3  ; 5  - GGCTGCGC CGGAGTGCGCGCCGTTTTGT-3  , Csrp1 MRE2 : 5  - TGTTGTGGTGCAGTGTGCAAAGCCTAC-3  ; 5  - ACCAGTAGGCTTTGCACACTGCACCAC-3  , Csrp1 MRE3 : 5  - GAGATCGCCATAGGGTGCAAAGAGAAG-3  ; 5  - GTGACTTCTCTTTGCACCCTATGGCGA-3  , Csrp1 MRE4 : 5  - TGTCTTATTCTGGAGTGCAAGTTAGTC-3  ; 5  - AGGGGACTAACTTGCACTCCAGAATAA-3  , Gal4 : 5  - TCCGGAGGACTGTCCTCCGG-3  ; 5  - GCCGGAGGACAGTCCTCCGG-3  , MREd [ MRE derived from mouse Mt1 promoter ( 10 ) ] : 5  - CGAGGGAGCTCTGCACTCCGCCCGAAAAGTG-3  ; 5  - TCGACACTTTTCGGGCGGAGTGCAGAGCTCCCTCGAGCT-3  , MRE-s [ synthetic MRE consensus sequence ( 10 ) ] : 5  - CGAGGGAGCTCTGCACACGGCCCGAAAAGTG-3  ; 5  - TCGACACTTTTCGGGCCGTGTGCAGAGCTCCCTCGAGCT-3  , Ndrg1 MRE1 : 5  - CAGCCCAGGCAGGGTGCAGCACGAG-3  ; 5  - CCGCCTCGTGCTGCACCCTGCCTGG-3  , Ndrg1 MRE2 : 5  - CACACGTTCGCTGCACACGCCGCGG-3  ; 5  - GGGACCGCGGCGTGTGCAGCGAACG-3  , Ndrg1 MRE3 ,4 : 5  - GGAGTCCTTATGCACACGCGCACGAGCGCGCACGGGCAC-3  ; 5  - TGGTGTGCCCGTGCGCGCTCGTGCGCGTGTGCATAAGGAC-3  , Sepw1 MRE1 : 5  - GAGGCAGTCGGCTGTGCGCACGGCCCCACGCTC-3  ; 5  - CTCTGAGCGTGGGGCCGTGCGCACAGCCGACTGC-3  , Sepw1 MRE2 : 5  - ATGGTTTTGGGGGTGCGCAGGGGGTCTG-3  ; 5  - CGACAGACCCCCTGCGCACCCCCAAAAC-3  , Slc39a10 MRE1 : 5  - GAATACACGACTGGGTGCAGCCGGGGTTTGG-3  ; 5  - GGTACCAAACCCCGGCTGCACCCAGTCGTGTA-3  , Slc39a10 MRE2 : 5  - GCGGAGAGGAGATGCACACGGCACTCG-3  ; 5  - CACTCGAGTGCCGTGTGCATCTCCTCT-3  , Specificity <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> 1 ( Sp1 ) binding sequence ( 10 ) : 5  - CGAGGCCCCGCCCAG-3  ; 5  - TCGACTGGGCGGGGCCTCGAGct-3  .
Primary embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from a 12.5 day old Mtf1loxP mouse embryo and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( ICN ) , 100 U/ml <termsem="CHEBI:17334"> penicillin </term> -- <termsem="CHEBI:17076"> streptomycin </term> ( Gibco BRL ) and 2 mM <termsem="CHEBI:18050"> l-glutamine </term> ( Gibco BRL ) .
100 mm plates with primary cells were transfected with 10 g of an expression plasmid coding for simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) large T antigen driven by the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter , using lipofectamine  <termsem="CHEBI:33893"> reagent </term> ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cell foci were isolated and the immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line ckoC was derived from one of them .
The Mtf1loxP genotype of this line as well as the genomic integration of the T antigen were confirmed by PCR .
100 mm plates with these cells were further transfected by the <termsem="CHEBI:32596"> <termsem="CHEBI:35433"> <termsem="CHEBI:9679"> <termsem="CHEBI:22984"> calcium </term> <termsem="CHEBI:18367"> <termsem="CHEBI:26020"> phosphate </term> </term> </term> </term> </term> method ( 30 ) with 19.6 g of an expression plasmid for Cre recombinase driven by the CMV promoter and 0.4 g of an expression plasmid for the <termsem="CHEBI:44577"> neomycin </term> resistance gene under the control of the TK promoter .
Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 0.4 g/l G418 ( Calbiochem ) , isolated clones of resistant cells were harvested and grown independently , and the expression of Cre recombinase and excision of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 were analyzed by RT -- PCR .
The cell lines delC19 , delC21 and delC23 with a deletion of Mtf1 were chosen for further experiments .
Samples of 1  104 cells/well were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h .
The cells were then pre-incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0 , 5 , 10 , 25 or 50 M l-buthionine - [ S , R ] - sulfoximine ( BSO ) ( Sigma ) , a <termsem="CHEBI:23888"> drug </term> that inhibits <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> synthesis ( 31 ) .
Later , cells were exposed to 0 , 5 , 10 or 20 M <termsem="CHEBI:35456"> CdCl2 </term> in the specified pre-incubation medium for an additional 24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT ( 3 - [ 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium <termsem="CHEBI:15858"> <termsem="CHEBI:22925"> bromid </term> </term> ) - based Cell Proliferation Kit I ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Generation of an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout mouse line .
Using a homologous recombination strategy , mice were obtained with a modified Mtf1 allele Mtf1loxP where exons 3 and 4 , encoding four of the six <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> fingers of the DNA-binding domain , are flanked by loxP sites ( Figure 1a ) .
Mice homozygous for the Mtf1loxP allele were further crossed with animals of the Cre recombinase transgenic line Mx-cre .
Cre recombinase is expressed in this line under the control of the mouse Mx1 gene promoter , which is inducible by administration of interferon alpha or beta , or synthetic double-stranded RNA pI -- pC ( 32 ) .
Cre-mediated deletion was reported to be complete in the liver , while varying in other tissues , ranging from 94 % in spleen to 8 % in brain ( 32 ) .
After Cre-mediated deletion of exons 3 and 4 , which results in a frameshift and premature translation stop , no functional MTF-1 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> can be produced .
For induction of Cre recombinase , Mtf1 conditional knockout mice harboring the Mx-cre transgene ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) received four intraperitoneal pI -- pC injections at 3 day intervals ( pI -- pC induction ) ; control littermates without transgene ( Mtf1loxP ) received similar injections .
Using RT -- PCRs ( Figure 1b ) , a shortened product was obtained with RNA from Mtf1Mx-cre livers , indicating a successful excision of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in these animals .
On close examination , a very faint band similar in size to full-length signal was also observed in those mice , probably due to a low amount of residual full-length Mtf1 <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> .
The level of functional MTF-1 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> was examined by EMSA ( Figure 1c ) : MTF-1 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> -- DNA complex was detectable with liver <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse , but no functional MRE-binding <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> was observed with an Mtf1Mx-cre sample .
Thus , deletion of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in the liver of Mtf1Mx-cre mice was virtually complete .
All examined liver-specific knockout mice were viable under laboratory conditions and appeared normal .
MTF-1 target gene search .
For the identification of MTF-1 target genes , we compared the liver transcript profiles of mice with and without functional Mtf1 gene that had been mock-treated or exposed to <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment ) .
In a first screen , the transcripts were analyzed with a differential display-based method , called amplification of double-stranded cDNA end restriction fragments ( ADDER ) ( 33 ) .
Thereby an overwhelming number of signals was obtained for the two stress-inducible metallothioneins ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) , due to the abundance of their transcripts both in mock-treated and especially in <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated livers that harbored a functional MTF-1 gene ( data not shown ) .
This result confirmed the importance of MTF-1 for both basal and <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> - induced expression of metallothionein genes .
In a second approach , the gene expression profile in livers of the above mentioned mice was compared by Affymetrix GeneChip  Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays ( Table 1 ) .
When analyzing the probe array data of livers from mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice , an at least 2-fold , reliable downregulation of expression was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 13 Affymetrix GeneChip  probe sets corresponding to 11 characterized genes ( Table 1 , a ) .
Seven of these genes contain one or more MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC within a segment of 1000 bp upstream of the transcription start .
For 26 probe sets corresponding to 24 different characterized genes , a 2-fold or higher , reliable upregulation was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers ( Table 1 , b ) ; 17 of these 24 genes contain MRE core consensus sequences in the upstream region .
The data set for livers of <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice revealed an at least 2-fold , reliable downregulation in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 21 probe sets corresponding to 16 different characterized genes ( Table 1 , c ) ; 10 of these contain MRE core consensus sequences in their upstream region .
For 9 probe sets corresponding to 9 different characterized genes , an at least 2-fold , reliable upregulation was detected ( Table 1 , d ) ; five of them contain MRE motifs .
In addition to characterized genes , ESTs and RIKEN cDNA sequences were also found in the comparison of Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP livers to be differentially expressed ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .
Downregulation of Mt1 and Mt2 was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for both conditions ( though the level of significance for the downregulation of Mt1 in mock-treated animals was above 0.05 ; data not shown ) .
For all MTF-1 target genes characterized so far , such as Mt1 , Mt2 and Znt1 , MTF-1 exerts its transcriptional activation activity via standard MRE sequences located proximal to the transcription start ( 4,5,8,18,19 ) .
Even a specific search for MTF-1 binding sites by selection from a pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides with random sequences yielded no new binding motif for MTF-1 in addition to the known MREs ( 34 ) .
Thus , an MRE sequence is to date the only indication for a direct MTF-1 target gene , and four MRE-containing target gene candidates were further analyzed .
Basal expression of Sepw1 depends on MTF-1 .
Sepw1 was found in microarray analysis to be significantly downregulated in livers from <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - and mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice ( Table 1 , a and c ) .
SEPW1 is a <termsem="CHEBI:32757"> selenocysteine </term> - containing <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> that binds <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> ( 35 ) and is thought to act as an <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> in vivo ( 36 ) .
Sepw1 expression in livers of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice was further analyzed by semiquantitative RT -- PCRs and S1 analysis ( Figure 2a and b ) .
In accordance with microarray data a slight , if any , upregulation of Sepw1 transcription was observed in livers from Mtf1loxP mice upon <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> treatment .
The basal level was reduced in livers from mock - and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice , indicating that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of Sepw1 .
Three MRE core consensus sequences were found in the region upstream of the mouse Sepw1 transcription start ( Figure 2c ) .
Two of them in opposite orientation overlap almost completely proximal to the transcription start ( MRE1 ,  40 bp ) , the third one is located further upstream ( MRE2 ,  527 bp ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 to Sepw1 MRE1 but not MRE2 oligonucleotide was observed in EMSA with liver <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse ( Figure 2d ) .
As a control , no binding to MRE1 was detected with extract from a pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre mouse , confirming that the bandshift was indeed dependent on the presence of MTF-1 .
<termsem="CHEBI:22977"> Cadmium </term> response of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Ndrg1 was significantly downregulated in microarrays of liver transcripts from <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to similarly treated Mtf1loxP control mice ( Table 1 , c ) .
Ndrg1 probably has some role in stress response since various stimuli , including hypoxia and <termsem="CHEBI:28112"> nickel </term> <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> compounds </term> , activate expression of rodent Ndrg1 and/or its human ortholog ( 37 -- 40 ) .
The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative RT -- PCRs ( Figure 3a ) : for Mtf1loxP control livers , a clear increase of Ndrg1 expression was observed after <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure ; in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , this <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> response was not detectable , while basal expression was similar to controls .
This indicates that <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - induced expression of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Five MRE core consensus sequences are located upstream of the mouse Ndrg1 transcription start ( Figure 3b ) .
Four of them are clustered ( MRE1 to MRE4 ,  138 to  332 bp ) , the fifth one is located farther upstream ( MRE5 ,  883 bp ) .
EMSA was performed to test whether MTF-1 is interacting with some or all of the four proximal MRE sequences ( Figure 3c ) .
Separate oligonucleotides were tested for MRE1 and MRE2 , whereas one oligonucleotide spanning both sequences was used for MRE3 and MRE4 ( MRE3 ,4 ) .
No complex was seen with MRE1 , but specific MTF-1 complexes were observed for both the MRE2 and MRE3 ,4 oligonucleotides with liver <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract from an Mtf1loxP mouse .
As expected , no bandshift was observed with <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract from a mouse lacking MTF-1 ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:22977"> Cadmium </term> response of Csrp1 depends on MTF-1 .
Csrp1 was found in microarray analyses to be significantly downregulated in <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to Mtf1loxP mice ( Table 1 , c ) .
CSRP1 is a member of the evolutionary conserved CRP family of <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> that have been implicated in myogenesis and cytoskeletal remodeling ( 41,42 ) .
Semiquantitative RT -- PCRs confirmed the microarray results , namely , that Csrp1 expression is elevated in Mtf1loxP livers upon <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure ( Figure 4a ) .
In contrast , no <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> response was detectable in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , suggesting that MTF-1 is required for <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> induction of Csrp1 .
Three MRE core consensus sequences were found upstream of the Csrp1 transcription start ( MRE2 to MRE4 ,  56 to  366 bp ) , one was found immediately downstream ( MRE1 , +7 bp ; Figure 4b ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed with EMSA for MRE2 oligonucleotide and <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract from an Mtf1loxP liver , but not an Mtf1Mx-cre liver extract lacking MTF-1 , confirming the participation of MTF-1 in the complex ( Figure 4c ) .
MTF-1 inhibits expression of Slc39a10 .
Slc39a10 was detected in microarray analysis to be significantly upregulated in livers from both mock - and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to control animals ( Table 1 , b and d ) .
SLC39 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> are members of the Zrt - and Irt-like <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> ( ZIP ) family of <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ion </term> transporters that transport , with no known exception , <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ion </term> substrates across cellular membranes into the cytoplasm ( 43,44 ) .
In accordance with microarray data , semiquantitative RT -- PCRs showed a downregulation of Slc39a10 expression in livers of Mtf1loxP mice upon <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure .
In samples from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , the basal expression was significantly increased ; <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> treatment still resulted in a decrease of Slc39a10 expression ( Figure 5a ) .
It can not be judged by this experiment whether the degree of <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - induced reduction of Slc39a10 transcription was identical for Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice or lower in the absence of MTF-1 .
In microarray analysis , the degree of the downregulation was either comparable to the one in control livers or lower , depending on the considered Affymetrix GeneChip  probe set ( data not shown ) .
The results indicate that MTF-1 is involved in repression of the basal expression of Slc39a10 .
It might also participate in the <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> response of this gene , but it is apparently not exclusively responsible .
One MRE core consensus sequence was found just upstream of the mouse Slc39a10 transcription start ( MRE1 ,  21 bp ) , another one directly downstream ( MRE2 , +17 bp ; Figure 5b ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed in EMSA analysis for MRE2 with liver <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> extract from an Mtf1loxP but not from an Mtf1Mx-cre mouse , while no binding was detected with MRE1 ( Figure 5c ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:22977"> Cadmium </term> - responsive , MTF-1-independent genes .
Finally , we also identified a number of <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - responsive genes that were independent of MTF-1 presence , by comparing the probe array data of all <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated mice with the data of all mock-treated mice , irrespective of the genotype ( Table 2 ) .
An at least 2-fold , reliable upregulation was observed after <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure for 31 probe sets corresponding to 21 different characterized genes ( Table 2 , a ) .
For 2 probe sets corresponding to 2 characterized genes , an at least 2-fold downregulation was detected ( Table 2 , b ) .
Several genes involved in the metabolism of the <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> were found to be upregulated by <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure , namely the genes encoding the catalytic subunit of <termsem="CHEBI:14321"> <termsem="CHEBI:29987"> glutamate </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15356"> cysteine </term> ligase ( Gclc ) that is the rate limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> ( 45 ) ; <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> reductase 1 ( Gsr ) , the reducing enzyme for <termsem="CHEBI:17858"> oxidized <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> </term> ( 45 ) ; and <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:26833"> S </term> - transferase , mu 4 ( Gstm4 ) , which is a member of the <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:26833"> S </term> - transferase supergene family of detoxification enzymes ( 45 ) .
In all of these cases , induction was confirmed by semiquantitative RT -- PCRs ( data not shown ) .
Gclc , also referred to as heavy chain subunit of <termsem="CHEBI:24195"> gamma-glutamylcysteine </term> synthetase ( Ggcs-hc ) , had been discussed previously as a target gene of MTF-1 ( 6 ) .
Our expression data indicate that Gclc is induced by <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> but , at least in the adult mouse liver , not dependent on MTF-1 .
To analyze the role of the <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> system in the cellular <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> response , mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without functional Mtf1 were treated with <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> in combination with BSO , a specific <termsem="CHEBI:35222"> inhibitor </term> of <termsem="CHEBI:14321"> <termsem="CHEBI:29987"> glutamate </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:15356"> cysteine </term> ligase ( 31 ) , and cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium <termsem="CHEBI:24866"> salt </term> MTT ( Figure 6 ) .
Increasing concentrations of BSO or <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> alone were to some extent cytotoxic for the examined cell lines .
Treatment with both BSO and <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> resulted in an enhanced lethality particularly for the cells without functional Mtf1 , indicating that a depletion of <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> together with a lack of Mtf1 impair an efficient anti- <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> defense .
Thus , adequate <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> supply as well as MTF-1 and its target genes are essential for the survival of the cell under <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> stress .
Besides genes related to the <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> pathway , several other stress-related genes were upregulated upon <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure , including genes for <termsem="CHEBI:15033"> thioredoxin </term> reductase 1 ( Txnrd1 ) , one of the reducing enzymes of the <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> <termsem="CHEBI:15033"> thioredoxin </term> ( 46 ) ; KDEL endoplasmic reticulum <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> retention receptor 2 ( Kdelr2 ) participating in ER stress response ( 47 ) ; and the anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 ( Bag3 ) involved in stress-induced apoptosis ( 48 ) .
In this study , a virtually complete deletion of Mtf1 in the liver of adult , pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre mice did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective mice under non-stress conditions , confirming that MTF-1 is dispensable in the adult liver ( 26 ) , in contrast to its essential role in embryonic liver development ( 23 ) .
The comparison of gene expression in livers of mock - or <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice revealed several MTF-1 target gene candidates .
Transcripts of the two stress-responsive metallothionein genes Mt1 and Mt2 were severely reduced , in support of a crucial role of MTF-1 for both basal and <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> - induced expression of metallothioneins ( 4,6 ) .
One of the newly found target genes is Sepw1 .
The exact <termsem="CHEBI:23367"> molecular </term> function of SEPW1 <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is unknown to date , but a role as <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> has been proposed due to its ability to bind <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> ( 35 ) .
In accordance with this , ectopic expression of mouse Sepw1 renders cells resistant to <termsem="CHEBI:16240"> <termsem="CHEBI:49637"> hydrogen </term> <termsem="CHEBI:44785"> peroxide </term> </term> , and this resistance is dependent on it binding <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , Amantana et al. ( 49 ) showed that expression of a reporter gene fused to a rat Sepw1 promoter fragment can be induced in rat glial cells by <termsem="CHEBI:28694"> copper </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> , but not <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> .
This response was dependent on an overlapping-inverted MRE sequence located proximal to the rat Sepw1 transcription start ( 49 ) , even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF-1 binding to that sequence ( 50 ) .
Our expression and DNA-binding studies strongly suggest that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of mouse Sepw1 by binding to the corresponding overlapping-inverted MRE sequence .
Ndrg1 , another interesting MTF-1 target gene was named N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 following the discovery that the transcription factor N-myc represses the expression of mouse Ndrg1 ( 51 ) .
Transcription of Ndrg1 and/or its human ortholog is induced by different physiological and cell stress conditions , such as androgens , <termsem="CHEBI:28112"> nickel </term> <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> compounds </term> , DNA damage and hypoxia ( 37 -- 40,52,53 ) .
In addition , the <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is overexpressed in human cancers of many tissues , such as lung , liver , brain , breast , kidney and skin ( 40 ) .
Although Ndrg1 and especially its human ortholog have been quite intensely studied , its function remains unclear ; however , the induction by stimuli like <termsem="CHEBI:28112"> nickel </term> and hypoxia suggests an involvement in the cell stress response .
Such a role is strongly endorsed by our finding that Ndrg1 gene expression is also induced by <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> , and that MTF-1 plays a crucial role in this induction .
In the case of Csrp1 , expression analyses and DNA-binding studies indicate that MTF-1 is required for <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> induction by binding to an MRE upstream of the transcription start .
Studies with human , avian and chicken CSRP1 have shown that this <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> is localized at adhesion plaques and in association with filamentous actin , and interacts with the adhesion plaque <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> zyxin , as well as the actin-cross-linking <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> alpha-actinin ( 54 -- 57 ) .
The ability to bind these partners suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization ( 58 ) .
Exposure of cultured cells to <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> causes a decrease in , and destruction of , cellular contact <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> and the actin cytoskeleton ( 59 ) .
In the proximal tubule cells of the rat kidney , a partial loss of actin and the actin-bundling <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> villin is observed upon <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> treatment , as well as the derangement and depolymerization of microtubules ( 60 ) .
Assuming that CSRP1 is important for the organization of cytoskeletal elements in the mouse , its upregulation by <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> might protect the organism from damage of the cytoskeleton .
Such a mechanism would expand the role of MTF-1 in stress response .
Our expression studies also suggest that MTF-1 represses basal transcription of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as activator for the expression of other target genes like Mt1 , Mt2 , and Znt1 ( 4,19 ) .
SLC39A10 is one of 14 mouse SLC39 members , which belong to the ZIP family of <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ion </term> transporters ( 43,44 ) .
All members of the ZIP family characterized so far increase intracellular cytoplasmic <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ion </term> concentrations by promoting extracellular and vesicular <termsem="CHEBI:24870"> ion </term> transport into the cytoplasm .
ZIP <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> have been reported to be transporters of <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:18248"> iron </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:18291"> manganese </term> and/or <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> ( 44,61 -- 63 ) .
Although SLC39A10 is largely uncharacterized ( 44 ) , it is referred to in several databases as putative <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> transporter .
It has been previously shown that MTF-1 is important for both basal expression and <termsem="CHEBI:33521"> metal </term> induction of the mouse Znt1 gene ( 19 ) .
ZnT <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> represent a different family of transporters that reduce intracellular cytoplasmic <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> by promoting <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> efflux from cells or into intracellular vesicles .
Thus , members of the ZnT and ZIP family with <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> as predominant substrate have opposite roles in cellular <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> homeostasis ( 43 ) .
Assuming that SLC39A10 is indeed a <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> transporter , MTF-1 would control expression of two <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> transporters with antagonistic functions , namely , Znt1 and Slc39a10 .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed for an MRE located just downstream of the Slc39a10 transcription start .
In a simple model , such a binding could interfere with the accessibility of the transcriptional start site for RNA polymerase II and/or general transcription factors , thus preventing transcription initiation of the gene .
Indeed , such a mechanism has been described in yeast for the <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> - responsive activator <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> 1 ( Zap1 ) and its target gene , <termsem="CHEBI:27363"> zinc </term> - regulated transporter 2 ( ZRT2 ) ( 64 ) .
However , the inhibition of Slc39a10 expression by MTF-1 may well be more complex than a competition for promoter binding .
Independent of MTF-1 , <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> treatment also leads to downregulation of Slc39a10 transcripts , suggesting that some other factor is mediating this response .
A previous target gene search for MTF-1 with mouse embryos of conventional Mtf1 knockout phenotype revealed , besides metallothionein genes , the multifunctional alpha-fetoprotein ( Afp ) and the liver-enriched transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> alpha ( Cebpa ) as prime candidates ( 65 ) .
After an early onset during hepatogenesis , Afp expression is repressed postnatally and replaced by albumin ( 66 ) .
Thus , our adult Mtf1Mx-cre mice lacking MTF-1 were not suitable to analyze Afp expression .
Cebpa is expressed in the adult liver as well as in other tissues ( 67 ) , but the present microarray data revealed no significant expression differences in livers from adult Mtf1loxP and Mtf1Mx-cre mice ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , MTF-1 may affect Cebpa expression only during embryonal development , perhaps in combination with as yet unidentified factors .
The present study confirms and extends the role of MTF-1 as an important stress response regulator .
We have identified and preliminarily characterized four target genes of MTF-1 in the adult mouse liver : in the case of Sepw1 , MTF-1 is required to maintain basal expression , supporting a role of mouse MTF-1 in oxidative stress response .
In addition , MTF-1 contributes to the <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - induced expression of Ndrg1 and Csrp1 .
Furthermore , MTF-1 helps to repress the basal expression of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as transcriptional activator for genes like Mt1 , Mt2 or Znt1 .
Thus the same transcription factor apparently serves as an activator or repressor , depending on the target gene .
The comparison of liver gene expression of <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - and mock-treated mice also revealed a number of genes that were responsive to <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> exposure , independent of the presence or absence of MTF-1 .
Evidence suggests that the production of <termsem="CHEBI:26523"> reactive <termsem="CHEBI:25805"> oxygen </term> species </term> is a major effect of acute <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> toxicity ( 68,69 ) , and exposure of cultured cells or animals to <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> is associated with depletion of <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> reduced glutathione </term> , <termsem="CHEBI:18059"> lipid </term> peroxidation and DNA damage ( 70 -- 73 ) .
Oxidative stress and the subsequent restoration of cellular homeostasis have been shown to induce the expression of genes encoding acute-phase <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:22586"> antioxidant </term> enzymes ( 74 ) .
In mammals , <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> tends to accumulate in the kidney and liver as a <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - metallothionein complex that has an extremely slow turnover ( 75,76 ) .
Furthermore , metallothioneins provide protection against oxidative stress ( 1,17 ) .
In addition to metallothioneins , <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> was postulated as a first line of defense against <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> toxicity ( 77 ) .
<termsem="CHEBI:16856"> Glutathione </term> efficiently complexes <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> ( 78 ) and scavenges <termsem="CHEBI:26519"> free radicals </term> and other <termsem="CHEBI:26523"> reactive <termsem="CHEBI:25805"> oxygen </term> species </term> directly , and indirectly via enzymatic reactions ( 45 ) .
In such reactions , <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> is oxidized and has to be regenerated by <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> reductase .
Also , <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:26833"> S </term> - transferases mediate the conjugation of various electrophiles to <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> .
The observed <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> - induced upregulation of Gclc , Gsr and Gstm4 supports the importance of <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> in the cellular <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> response .
The enhanced sensitivity to <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> toxicity that we found for mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon a combination of Mtf1 deletion and depletion of <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> further corroborates the importance of MTF-1 and its target genes as well as <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> reduced glutathione </term> for an efficient anti- <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> defense .
Our data provide strong evidence for at least two branches of cellular anti- <termsem="CHEBI:22977"> cadmium </term> defense , one via MTF-1 and its target genes , notably metallothioneins , the other via <termsem="CHEBI:16856"> glutathione </term> , with an apparent overlap in Sepw1 .

Deletion of Mtf1 in adult mouse liver .
( a ) Generation of Mtf1 conditional knockout mice .
The targeted allele was obtained by homologous recombination of wild-type ( wt ) allele and targeting vector in ES cells .
Removal of the neomycin cassette ( NEO ) by Cre recombinase led to the conditional knockout allele Mtf1loxP .
Conditional Cre-mediated deletion of exons 3 and 4 ( Mtf1 ) results in loss of function via loss of an essential part of the DNA-binding domain and the generation of a new stop codon right after exon 2 .
Exons 3 to 7 of Mtf1 are indicated by grey boxes , loxP sites by black triangles .
