Molecular cloning and characterization of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp gene family .
We have recently cloned and characterized a novel gene family named ancient conserved domain protein ( ACDP ) in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> .
To facilitate the functional study of this novel gene family , we have cloned and characterized Acdp , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> homologue of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP gene family .
The four Acdp genes ( Acdp1 , Acdp2 , Acdp3 and Acdp4 ) contain 3,631 bp , 3,244 bp , 2,684 bp and 2,743 bp of cDNA sequences , and encode deduced proteins of 951 , 874 , 713 and 771 amino acids , respectively .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp genes showed very strong homologies ( > 90 % ) in both nucleotide and amino acid sequences to their <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> counterparts .
In addition , both nucleotide and amino acid sequences within the Ancient Conserved Domain ( ACD ) are highly conserved in many different <termsem="species"> taxonomic species </term> .
Particularly , Acdp proteins showed very strong AA homologies to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC protein ( 35 % AA identity with 55 % homology ) , which is involved in magnesium and cobalt efflux .
The Acdp genes are widely expressed in all tissues tested except for Acdp1 , which is only highly expressed in the brain with low levels of expression in kidney and testis .
Immunostaining of Acdp1 in hippocampus neurons revealed a predominant localization on the plasma membrane .
The Acdp genes are evolutionarily conserved in diverse <termsem="species"> species </term> and ubiquitously expressed throughout development and adult tissues suggesting that Acdp may be an essential gene .
Acdp showed strong homology to <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC protein and predominantly localized on the plasma membrane .
These results suggest that Acdp is probably a family of proteins involved in ion transport in <termsem="NCBITaxon:40674"> mammalian </term> cells .
We have recently cloned and characterized a novel gene family named ancient conserved domain protein ( ACDP ) which encodes four protein members in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> [ 1 ] .
We found that this gene family is evolutionarily conserved in diverse <termsem="species"> species </term> ranging from <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> , and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> to <termsem="NCBITaxon:40674"> mammals </term> .
The sequence conservation and the presence of multiple members within a <termsem="species"> species </term> may imply functional importance associated with the genes .
To facilitate the functional analysis of the ACDP gene family , we cloned and characterized Acdp , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> homologue of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP gene family .
Molecular cloning of the Acdp gene family .
To clone the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp genes , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP cDNA and predicted protein sequences were used to search the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> EST database with the blastn and tblastn programs .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mouse </term> EST markers corresponding to each Acdp member were then identified .
For example , EST H3086H12-5 corresponds to Acdp1 , W98010 for Acdp2 , 603299135F1 for Acdp3 and BG083791 for Acdp4 .
A modified oligo-dT with a M13 tail was used for the RT reaction .
A forward primer from each EST marker and the M13 primer ( olig-dT tail ) were used to amplify the 3 ' UTR sequence for each corresponding Acdp gene from the RT products .
To obtain 5 ' - end coding sequences for the Acdp genes , we conducted a series nested PCR with combinations of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> primers .
The 5 ' UTR sequences were identified by directly sequencing BAC DNA containing the corresponding Acdp genes .
The BAC clones were identified by screening a CITB <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> BAC DNA library ( Research Genetics ) .
The 5 ' UTR sequences obtained from above were further confirmed by RT-PCR .
The Acdp1 gene contains 3,631 bp of nucleotide sequence and encodes a predicted protein with 951 amino acids ( AA ) .
The other three Acdp genes ( Acdp2 , 3 and 4 ) contain 3,244 bp , 2,684 bp and 2,743 bp of cDNA sequences , and encode deduced proteins of 874 amino acids , 713 amino acids and 771 amino acids , respectively .
Northern blot analyses of the Acdp gene family were carried out using membranes purchased from Origene .
A total of 12 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> tissues were included in the study ( Fig. 1 ) .
Due to sequence homologies between each Acdp member within the conserved domain , probes for Northern bolts were PCR fragments from the last exon and the 3 ' untranslated region sequences .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp messages showed almost the same tissue distributions as the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP genes .
Acdp1 message is highly expressed in the brain , while kidney and testis also showed low levels of expression .
Acdp2 showed higher expressions in the brain , kidney and liver .
However , the Acdp2 transcript was not present in the skeleton muscle and skin , and it showed very low levels of expression in the rest of tissues .
Acdp3 and Acdp4 showed different levels of expression in all tissues tested ; the highest expressions for Acdp3 were observed in the brain , kidney , liver and heart , and the highest expressions for Acdp4 were observed in the kidney , small intestine and testis .
The expression levels for Acdp3 and 4 in skeleton muscle were barely detectable ; however , -actin showed normal expression suggesting that the results were not a consequence of bad RNA quality ( data not shown ) .
The ubiquitous expression pattern may be taken as another indication of the functional importance of Acdp proteins in fundamental biological processes in addition to the sequence conservation in evolutionarily divergent <termsem="species"> species </term> .

Multiple Choice Northern Blot filters were purchased from Origene .
Radiation hybrid mapping indicated that the Acdp1 gene maps to chromosome 19 between markers D19Mit119 ( 34.3 cR proximal ) and D19Mit112 ( 13.6 cR distal ) .
The Acdp2 gene maps slightly more distal to the Acdp1 on chromosome 19 between D19Mit9 ( 2.4 cR proximal ) and D19Mit38 ( 15.1 cR distal ) .
The Acdp3 and Acdp4 genes map to chromosome 1 within one BAC clone ( RP23-294I17 ) , proximal to marker D1Mit171 ( 17.4 cR ) .
These regions are syntenic to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> counterparts .
Sequence homology and molecular characteristics .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp genes showed very strong homologies of both nucleotide and AA sequences to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP genes ( Table 1 ) .
The highest homologies were observed between the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP2 and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp2 gene ( 91 % of nucleotide identity , 97 % of AA identity and 99.4 % of AA homology ) .
In addition , the 5 ' UTR nucleotide sequences ( 20 bp of nucleotides before start codon ) also showed high homologies to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> homologs , for example , the Acdp2 5 ' UTR sequence showed 95 % identities to its <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> homolog .
However , the homologies in the 3 ' UTR sequences ( 20 bp of nucleotides after stop codon ) were much lower ( 40 -- 55 % ) for all Acdp genes except Acdp4 ( 90 % identity to its <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> homolog ) .
The ancient conserved domain ( ACD ) has 55.3 % of AA identity and 83.3 % of homology between all <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP proteins ( Fig. 2 ) .
The ACD domain is evolutionarily conserved in divergent <termsem="species"> species </term> ranging from <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7227"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> D. melanogaster </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> to <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ( Fig. 3 ) .
Particularly , as shown in Fig. 3 , Acdp proteins showed very strong AA homology to <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC protein ( 35 % AA identity with 55 % homology ) , which is involved in magnesium and cobalt efflux [ 7 ] .
High AA homology was also observed between the Acdp proteins and the <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> Amip3 protein ( 35 % AA identity with 56 % homology ) .
The Amip3 is likely to be a homologous to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC protein .
The Amip3 mutants confer resistance to copper toxicity ( Personal communication with Dr. V.C. Culotte , John Hopkins Bloomberg , School of Public Health ) .
The evolutionary relationships among those proteins are illustrated by a phylogenetic tree constructed based on the AA homology of proteins ( Fig. 4 ) .

Phylogenetic tree showing relationships among proteins containing the ACD domain from figure 2 and 3 .
The phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the calculation of the best match for the selected sequences .
Abbreviations for each protein are the same as presented in figure 3 .
We found that all <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp members contain four distinct transmembrane domains ( Fig. 5 ) , two CBS domains and a DUF21 domain that are found in <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC and <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> Amip3 proteins .
CBS domains are small intracellular modules that are mostly found in 2 or four copies within a protein .
Pairs of CBS domains dimerise to form a stable globular domain [ 8 ] .
DUF21 ( CD : pfam01959 .9 ) is a newly defined domain with unknown function .
This domain is a transmembrane region and found to be located in the N-terminus of the proteins adjacent to two intracellular CBS domains .
A cNMP-binding domain ( cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate-binding domain ) was found in all Acdp members .
Four transmembrane domains within Acdp4 protein .
Transmembrane domains were predicted by the TMHMM program .
The plot shows the posterior probabilities of inside / outside/TM helix .
At the top of the plot ( between 1 and 1.2 ) the N-best prediction is shown .
The plot is obtained by calculating the total probability that a residue sits in helix , inside , or outside summed over all possible paths through the model .
In addition , Acdp1 contains an Alanine-rich region ( 2 -- 10 : AAAAAAAAA ) , a Leucine-rich region ( 204 -- 257 : LLRVRPRLYGPGGDLLPPAWLRALGALLLLALSALF SGLRLSLLSLDPVELRVL ) , a Proline-rich region ( 78 -- 130 : PGPPVPAAPVPAPSLA PGENGTGDWAPRLVFIEEPPGAGGAAPSAVPTRPPGP ) , and two amidation sites ( 917 -- 920 : MGKK ; 926 -- 929 : SGRK ) .
Acdp2 has a glycine-rich region ( 201 -- 222 : GAGGSGSASGTVGGKGGAGVAG ) .
Acdp3 possesses a large alanine-rich region ( 2 -- 261 ) and a large leucine-rich region ( 201 -- 299 ) .
Acdp4 contains a leucine zipper pattern ( 185 -- 206 : LVMVLLVLSGIFSGLNLGLMAL ) and an amidation site ( 7 -- 10 : GGRR ) .
Antibody production , Western results and subcellular localization .
Peptides from Acdp1 N - ( TSFLLRVYFQPGPPATAAPVPSPT ) and C - ( TQQLTLSPAAVPTR ) terminuses , conserved peptide from ACD domain of Acdp1 ( HNIVDILFVKDLAFVDPDDCTPLLTVTRF ) were commercially synthesized ( Sigma Genosys ) .
These antigenic sites were predicted by software from Sigma Genosys and polyclonal antibodies for each peptide were produced by immunizing <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbits </term> .
To test the specificity of the antibodies , we conducted Western-blot analysis of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> brain tissue extracts .
As shown in Fig. 6A , the antibody produced by C-terminal peptide specifically detected Acdp1 ( lane 3 ) .
The antibody generated by N-terminal peptide recognized Acdp4 in addition to Acdp1 , although the reactivity to latter was significantly higher ( Fig. 6A , lane 2 ) .
As expected , the antibody produced by the conserved sequence peptide detected all Acdp proteins ( Fig. 6A , lane 1 ) .
To further determine the specificity of the antibody against the Acdp1 C-terminus , we analyzed extracts of HEK293 , 3T3 and PC12 cells .
The results are shown in Fig. 6B .
Apparently , this antibody detected a specific band of Acdp1 in all cell lysates .
Of note , shown in Fig. 6B are signals of 10 g extracts of HEK293 cell lysates , 100 g extracts of 3T3 and PC12 cell lysates .
Thus , the expression levels of Acdp1 in these cell types vary a lot , with the highest expression in HEK293 cells .
Nevertheless , these immunoblot results support our analysis of brain tissue extracts that the antibody against Acdp1 C-terminus specifically recognizes Acdp-1 .
The specificity of the Acdp1 C-terminus antibody suggests the possibility of using it to localize Acdp-1 within cells .
Since Northern blot revealed almost exclusive expression of Acdp1 in the brain , we examined its subcellular localization in hippocampus neurons isolated from <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryos .
The neurons were cultured on glass coverslips coated with a confluent monolayer of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> cortical astrocytes in dishes .
Immunostaining was using the Acdp1 C-terminus specific antibody .
Confocal imaging revealed that Acdp1 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane .
A series of sections of a cell at the thickness of 0.5 micrometer clearly showed membrane location of Acdp1-immunoreactivity ( Fig. 7 ) , which is consistent with the observation of transmembrane domains within the Acdp proteins .

The step of each imaging section is 0.5 m , from the surface of the neuron ( 0 m ) to the middle plan ( 4.5 m ) .
Although the exact functions of the ACDP gene family are not yet elucidated , several lines of evidence suggest that ACDP genes may play an important role in biological processes .
First , these genes are evolutionarily conserved in many phylogenetically divergent <termsem="species"> species </term> ; Second , multiple genes are present in a <termsem="species"> species </term> ; Third , these genes are ubiquitously expressed throughout development and adult tissues ( unpublished data ) .
The cloning and characterization of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Acdp gene family are a very important step towards the elucidation of the functions of this multigene family .
Sequence homology analyses revealed that Acdp proteins shared very strong AA homologies to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC protein and <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> Amip3 protein .
CorA , B , C and D belong to a protein family involved in both influx and efflux of magnesium and cobalt .
It has been shown that CorA mutants confer resistance to cobalt toxicity [ 9 ] .
Amip3 appears to be a homologous to CorC protein which is involved in efflux of magnesium and cobalt in <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> .
Amip3 mutants confer resistant to copper toxicity .
Acdp proteins also possess the domains that are found in <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> CorC and <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> Amip3 proteins , such as the CBS domains , DUF21 domain and transmembrane domains .
In addition , a cNMP-binding domain was found in all Acdp proteins , which is usually present in ion channels and cNMP-dependent kinases [ 10-13 ] .
Using antibody produced by Acdp1 C-terminal peptide , we have shown that Acdp1 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane in hippocampus neurons .
In our previous study , we found <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleus in HeLa cells [ 1 ] .
The discrepancy for Acdp localization in neuronal cells could be caused by non-specificity for previous antibody which was produced by the recombinant ACD domain , or different cells used .
In current study , the Acdp1 C-terminus antibody only recognizes Acdp1 in brain tissue extracts as well as in HEK293 , 3T3 and PC12 cell lysates , suggesting the specificity of the antibody .
Our observations suggested that Acdp might be involved in ion transport in <termsem="NCBITaxon:40674"> mammalian </term> cells .
However , more detailed functional studies are needed to demonstrate the real functions of these proteins .
Our previous work has described <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP genes [ 1 ] .
The new information of the current work includes : 1 ) .
It is the first time to report the existence of multiple Acdp genes in other <termsem="NCBITaxon:40674"> mammals </term> in addition to <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> , while Acdp appears to be a single copy gene in lower <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> such as in <termsem="NCBITaxon:6239"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> C. elegans </term> </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeasts </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:2"> bacteria </term> .
We have also suggested the evolutionary relationships of Acdp genes in different <termsem="species"> species </term> ( phylogenetic tree ) ; 2 ) .
Molecular cloning and characterization of <termsem="NCBITaxon:39107"> murine </term> Acdp gene family are essential for study of this novel gene family in <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animal </term> model , e.g. for generation of knockout or transgenic models ; 3 ) .
We have demonstrated both DNA and amino acid conservations between <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> for each Acdp gene and the whole Acdp gene family , which provide important information for the possibility of functional redundancy or overlap between Acdp members ; 4 ) .
We have generated antibodies specific for Acdp1 and all Acdp proteins .
The Acdp1 C-terminus antibody appears to specifically recognize Acdp1 .
Using this antibody , we have demonstrated that Acdp1 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane in hippocampus neurons .
These results represent an important step towards the characterization of functions for the Acdp gene family .
cDNA cloning of the Acdp gene family was performed based on <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> homologue sequences as previously reported [ 2 ] .
Briefly , the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP cDNAs and predicted AA sequences were used to search the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> EST database for EST markers corresponding to each Acdp member .
A forward primer within the <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ACDP 5 ' cDNA coding region ( after start codon ) and a <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> reverse primer from the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> EST marker were used to amplify the homologue sequence from <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> cDNA at very low annealing temperature ( 45 -- 50 C ) .
A nested PCR using an inside reverse primer from the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> EST sequence and the same <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> forward primer was then carried out to amplify the specific <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> gene from the first round PCR products at high annealing temperature ( 62 C ) .
The expected PCR products were directly excised from agarose gel and sequenced by an ABI377 automatic sequencer .
The sequence was further confirmed using a forward primer from newly identified sequence and a reverse primer from known sequence .
Once most of the coding sequences were identified , partial sequence of exon 1 and the 5 ' UTR sequences were obtained by BAC DNA sequencing .
Multiple Choice Northern Blot filters containing 12 different <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> tissues were purchased from Origene .
The filters were probed for each Acdp gene with a PCR fragment ( around 350 bp ) from last exon and the 3 ' untranslated region labeled with -32P dCTP using the random primer extension system ( Life Technologies ) .
Hybridizations were carried out overnight .
The filters were washed twice with washing buffer I ( 2  SSC , 0.1 % SDS ) at 42 C for 15-min , and then washed twice with washing buffer II ( 0.25  SSC , 0.1 % SDS ) at 65 C for 15-min .
Washed filters were exposed to X-ray films for overnight or longer [ 3,4 ] .
Antibody production and Western blot analyses .
Peptides linked to KLH ( <termsem="NCBITaxon:54986"> keyhole limpet </term> hemacyanin ) from Acdp1 N - and C-terminals and the conserved domain ( ACD ) were used for generation of antibodies specifically for Acdp1 and all Acdp members as reported , respectively [ 5 ] .
Western blots were carried out Using ECL ( PIERCE ) as described previously [ 1 ] .
The membranes were washed extensively after incubation with primary and secondary antibodies and were then developed with X-ray films with optimal exposure time .
The T31 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> radiation hybrid panel from Research Genetics was used to map the chromosome location of each Acdp member .
Primers from 3 ' UTR of each Acdp member were used to amplify the 100 radiation hybrid clones representing the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> genome .
The data were submitted to the Jackson Laboratory <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mouse </term> Radiation Hybrid Database for analysis .
Sequence assembly was performed with program Sequencher ( Gene Codes Corp ) .
Protein and DNA homology searches were carried out with tblastn , tblastx , blastp and blastn programs .
Multiple sequence alignments were performed with GeneDoc and pairwise sequence alignment .
Multiple programs including BCM Search Launcher , ProfileScan , sequence motif search , ExPASy and 3Dpssm were used for searching sequence features of known protein .
Phylogenetic tree was constructed by Clustalw program ( version 1.81 ) using UPGMA ( Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages ) algorithm [ 14 ] .
Neuronal cell preparation and immunostanining .
Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared as previously reported [ 6 ] .
In brief , the hippocampuses were dissected out from <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryos at 16 days in utero .
The tissues were then incubated for 20 min at 37 C in MEM ( minimum essential medium ) modified for suspension culture ( Life Technologies ) plus 0.25 % trypsin ( Life Technologies ) .
The dissociated hippocampal neurons were plated on glass coverslips coated with a confluent monolayer of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> cortical astrocytes obtained as described below .
The neurons were maintained at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 .
Cortical astrocytes dissociated from newborn <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> cortices were grown in culture flasks at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 until confluent .
The cells were exposed to 10-5 M cytosine arabinoside ( Sigma ) and cultured for additional 12 -- 24 hrs at 37 C .
After remove of the media with cellular debris , the cells were used for coating coverslips .
For immunostaining , neuronal cells on the coverslips were first fixed in PBS containing 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 12 hrs at 4 C and then incubated in a solution containing 4 % PFA and 0.4 % Triton X-100 at 4 C for 1 hr .
After washing with PBS three times , the cells were incubated with a blocking solution containing 1:30 normal <termsem="NCBITaxon:9925"> goat </term> serum , and subsequently incubated with a <termsem="NCBITaxon:9986"> rabbit </term> polyclonal anti-ACDP antibody ( 1:3000 ) overnight at 4 C .
After extensive washing with 1 % <termsem="NCBITaxon:9925"> goat </term> serum PBS solution , the cells were incubated with an Alex 488 conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:100 in 1 % <termsem="NCBITaxon:9925"> goat </term> serum PBS solution , Molecular Probes ) for 3 hrs at room temperature .
Following final washes with 1 % <termsem="NCBITaxon:9925"> goat </term> serum PBS solution , the neuronal cells on the coverslips were cover-slipped with a glycerol-based anti-photobleach medium .
The cells were viewed under a confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) .
Images were captured with a CCD camera and acquired by the Scion Image software ( Scion Corporation , Frederick , MD ) .
