RMCE-ASAP : a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting method for ES and somatic cells to accelerate phenotype analyses .
In recent years , tremendous insight has been gained on p53 regulation by targeting <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> using homologous recombination in ES cells to generate <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
Although informative , this approach is inefficient , slow and expensive .
To facilitate targeting at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> , we developed an improved Recombinase-Mediated <termsem="SO:0005853"> Cassette </term> Exchange ( RMCE ) method .
Our approach enables efficient targeting in ES cells to facilitate the production of <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
But more importantly , the approach was Adapted for targeting in Somatic cells to Accelerate Phenotyping ( RMCE-ASAP ) .
We provide proof-of-concept for this at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> , by showing efficient targeting in fibroblasts , and rapid phenotypic read-out of a recessive <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> after a single exchange .
RMCE-ASAP combines <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> heterologous recombinase target sites , a positive/negative selection marker that preserves the germline capacity of ES cells , and the power of mouse genetics .
These general principles should make RMCE-ASAP applicable to any <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
p53 is one of the most highly analyzed proteins for the past 25 years .
Studies in cultured cells , often relying on the transfection of <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> expressing various p53 <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutants </term> , have established models to explain how p53 is regulated .
In recent years , some of these models were tested in vivo by targeting subtle <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> using homologous recombination in embryonic stem ( ES ) cells to generate <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
The strength of this approach is that <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> are tested in a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> setting and expressed from the endogenous <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> , ensuring physiological expression levels and correct spatio-temporal profiles .
As significant differences between phenotypes from targeted p53 <termsem="SO:0001059"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mutants </term> </term> in vivo and transfection data were observed [ e.g. Refs ( 1 -- 5 ) ] , more targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> need to be generated and analyzed in multiple tissues to formulate more accurate models of p53 regulation .
However , using homologous recombination in ES cells to generate <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice is an inefficient , slow and expensive method because ( i ) homologous recombination typically occurs at low frequency in ES cells , requiring sophisticated selection schemes and screening of hundreds of clones to identify the desired <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutant </term> ; ( ii ) large ( 15 -- 20 kb ) <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> , often difficult to clone , are required to increase targeting efficiency and ( iii ) breeding mice to homozygosity and housing a mouse colony generate further delays and costs .
Such limitations make the repeated targeting of a <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> a technically daunting and economically impractical task .
Improvements in current technologies are needed to enable such analyses to be applied to the p53 or other <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Developing methods to increase targeting efficiency in ES cells is clearly an important goal .
In addition , efficient methods for <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting in fibroblasts could expedite phenotypic analyses .
Indeed , <termsem="SO:0000646"> siRNAs </term> in fibroblasts often provide a faster read-out than equivalent <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> knock-outs in animals ( 6 ) .
However , modeling most disease-associated <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> requires generating subtle <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> , not knock-outs or reduced expression <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
Targeting <termsem="SO:1000008"> point mutations </term> in fibroblasts by homologous recombination is extremely inefficient , and targeting both <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> is required to reveal the phenotype of recessive autosomal <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
Here we report an approach that enables highly efficient targeting at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> in both ES cells and fibroblasts .
Recombinase-Mediated <termsem="SO:0005853"> Cassette </term> Exchange ( RMCE ) approaches were developed to improve targeting efficiency using a two-step process : the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of interest is first <termsem="SO:0000048"> replaced </term> by a selection <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by recombinase target <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> ( e.g. <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> for Cre recombinase , to create a ` <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> ' <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> ) .
Then , Cre-mediated recombination in the presence of a <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> containing a <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> removes </term> the resident <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> and <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserts </term> the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( 7 ) .
Previously , technical difficulties have prevented RMCE from being applied routinely to generate <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice .
For example , exchanges using <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassettes </term> with directly repeated <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> were inefficient because <termsem="SO:0000045"> excisions </term> dominated the intended exchanges ( 8 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> with different <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> were generated to overcome this problem , but these <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> also underwent intramolecular recombination , making RMCE efficient only if the <termsem="SO:0000048"> replacement </term> <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> contained a marker enabling selection of the desired recombinant ( 7,9 -- 12 ) .
However , interference resulting from expression of the selection marker and the endogenous <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( 13 ) necessitates strategies to <termsem="SO:0000045"> remove </term> the selectable <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Together , previous studies indicate that an optimal RMCE requires ( i ) <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> heterologous <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> diverging by at least 2 <termsem="SO:0001236"> nt </term> to maximize the efficiency of exchange and ( ii ) an expression <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> enabling both positive selection to identify the initial recombinant and then negative selection to obtain a ` marker-free ' <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( 14 ) .
Most RMCE experiments have been performed at random <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> in somatic cell lines .
Only a few <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice generated by RMCE in ES cells have been reported , but the RMCE systematically <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduced </term> a selectable marker ( 15 -- 17 ) , or , when tested without an incoming marker , proved inefficient ( 12 ) .
A recent report disclosed an additional problem : the Hygromycin -- Thymidine Kinase <termsem="SO:0000287"> <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> gene </term> used most frequently for positive/negative selection in RMCE , leads to mouse sterility , so that exchanges can only be performed in ES cells ( 16 ) .
The RMCE strategy presented here relies on the integrated use of <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> heterologous <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> , a positive/negative selection marker that preserves the germline capacity of ES cells , and the power of mouse genetics to expedite phenotypic analyses .
We show that our approach enables efficient targeting of marker-free <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> in ES cells to generate <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mice , but more importantly , it is Adapted for targeting in Somatic cells to Accelerate Phenotyping ( ASAP ) .
Because it relies on very general principles , RMCE-ASAP could be applied to any <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> of interest .
Targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> for a p53 RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
Details for <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> construction are available upon request owing to space limitations mandating a brief outline .
We started from a <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> L3-1L containing heterologous <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> ( L3 is the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> loxP257 recently described ( 14 ) , 1L is an <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> ) .
The <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> and loxP257 differ in their spacer <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> : the spacer <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is 5  - ATGTATGC-3  for <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> and 5  - AAGTCTCC-3  for loxP257 .
The three <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in the loxP257 spacer <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> prevent it to recombine with <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> , ensuring efficient RMCE in several cell lines : accurate RMCE with these <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> occurred with an average frequency of 81 % at two <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> in CHO cells and an average frequency of 69 % at four <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> in Hela cells ( 14 ) .
The L3-1L <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> was first <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> to include a ClaI and a FseI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> between the <termsem="SO:0000346"> LoxP sites </term> , leading to <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> L3-CF-1L .
We next <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> a puroTK <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> ( YTC37 , a kind gift from A. Bradley ) by using <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> to destroy a NotI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> downstream of the puroTK <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduce </term> a NotI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> upstream , and a FseI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> downstream of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( leading to <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> CN-PuroTK-F ) .
Next , a PmlI-MfeI 6.3 kb <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from Trp53 was subcloned in a <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> pBluescript KSII + ( pBS , Stratagene ) , and the resulting <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> was digested with SwaI to <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduce </term> an EagI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> , leading to p53PmlEag , a <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 2 -- 11 of p53 .
We then <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> a 5.5 kb ClaI-EagI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from p53PmlEag in <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> CN-PuroTK-F digested by ClaI and NotI , and <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> the resulting <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> between the <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> of L3-CF-1L by ClaI and FseI digestion , leading to L3-p53PmlEagPuroTK-1L .
We next engineered a <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> containing the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> for 3  - homology downstream of the p53 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and the DTA <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in two steps : ( i ) we performed a three-way ligation between a <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> pBS digested by HindIII and NotI , a HindIII-EcoRI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from Trp53 for 3  homology and an EcoRI-NotI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> containing the DTA <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , from <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> pgkdtabpa ( kind gift of P. Soriano ) , leading to <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> 3  + DTA and ( ii ) because the Bsu36I-EcoRI <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> downstream of p53 contains <termsem="SO:0000657"> repetitive sequences </term> ( F. Toledo and G. M. Wahl , unpublished data ) , we later <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> , to obtain <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> 3  + DTA .
The 5  homology consists of a 3.4 kb-long BamHI-PmlI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> from <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> 1 of p53 cloned in a <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> pBS ( <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> p5  ) .
Finally , appropriate <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragments </term> from <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> p5  , L3-p53PmlEagPuroTK-1L , and 3  + DTA were assembled in a <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> pSP72 <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> ( Promega ) .
<termsem="SO:0000155"> Plasmid </term> Flox , the resulting targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , was verified by restriction analysis , then sequenced using 30 <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> chosen to precisely verify all p53 <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequences </term> , all <termsem="SO:0001421"> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> -- <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> junctions </term> and the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> at and around the <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> .
Exchange <termsem="SO:0001037"> constructs </term> : making the p53GFP and p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmids </term> .
To make a p53-GFP <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> protein , we first subcloned a SacII-HindIII <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> of the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> ( corresponding to <termsem="SO:0000852"> part of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> </term> 10 to <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> downstream of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ) into pBS , then <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> the HindIII <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> into a FseI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> .
We next <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> the <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal part </term> of the p53 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in two rounds of PCR <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutagenesis </term> , first with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> 5  - GGGCCTGACTCAGACGGATCCCCTCTGCATCCCGTC-3  and 5  - GACGGGATGCAGAGGGGATCCGTCTGAGTCAGGCCC-3  , which <termsem="SO:0000045"> removed </term> the <termsem="SO:0000319"> stop codon </term> and <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduced </term> a BamHI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> , then with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> 5  - GACGGATCCCCTCTGAATTCCGTCCCCATCACCA-3  and 5  - TGGTGATGGGGACGGAATACAGAGGGGATCCGTC-3  , which <termsem="SO:0000046"> introduced </term> an EcoRI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> .
We verified the sequence from the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> , then digested it with BamHI and EcoRI , to <termsem="SO:0000046"> insert </term> in <termsem="SO:0000717"> frame </term> GFP <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from a Bam HI-EcoRI <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> of <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> phr-GFP-1 ( Stratagene ) .
We verified the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of this p53-GFP <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> , then swapped it in the L3-p53PmlEagPuroTK-1L <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> ( see above ) by HindIII and FseI digestion , resulting in the p53GFP exchange <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> which was verified before use .
The p53PGFP exchange <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> was engineered by combining sequences from the p53GFP exchange <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> and <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from the p53P targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> described recently ( 5 ) .

A total of 8  105 p53RMCE / + ES cells were grown without puromycin for 12 h , electroporated with 15 g CMV-Cre <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> ( pOG231 ) and 200 g of the exchange <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , and plated in T25 flasks at 105 cells per flask .
FIAU was added to the medium 3 -- 4 days after electroporation .

Performing RMCE in MEFs .
A total of 106 p53RMCE /  MEFs cells were grown without puromycin for 12 h , electroporated with 3 g pOG231 and 30 g exchange <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> , and plated in a single 10 cm-dish , grown for 3 days then split in several dishes at 105 cells per dish .
FIAU or ganciclovir was added to the medium 4 days after electroporation , for 3 -- 4 days .
Clones , picked 10 days after electroporation , were grown in 24-well plates and expanded for freezing and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> analysis .
Cells , untreated or treated for 24 h with 0.5 g/ml adriamycin , were lysed on the dish in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris ( pH 8.0 ) , 5 mM EDTA , 150 mM NaCl , 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM sodium vanadate , 10 mM NaF and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitors ( Roche Diagnostics ) at 4 C for 30 min .

Probed blots were incubated with Pierce Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate and exposed to X-ray films .
Log phase cells were irradiated at RT with a 60 Co -irradiator at doses of 6 or 12 Gy and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then pulse-labeled for 1 h with BrdU ( 10 M ) , fixed in 70 % ethanol , double-stained with FITC anti-BrdU and propidium iodide , then sorted by using a Becton Dickinson FACScan machine .
Data were analyzed using Becton Dickinson Cellquest Pro .
The rationale for RMCE-ASAP is detailed in Figure 1 .
The first step requires generating a <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in ES cells that will serve as the substrate for subsequent exchanges ( RMCE-ready ES cell , Figure 1 ) .
The targeting strategy is detailed in Figure 2 .
The frequency of targeting was 4 % ( 12/300 puromycin-resistant clones , analyzed by Southern blot and long-range PCR , Figure 2 ) .
We next tested the efficiency of RMCE in ES cells , using a <termsem="SO:0000048"> replacement </term> <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> encoding p53 fused to GFP ( p53GFP ) to enable tracking p53 in individual live cells .
Importantly however , GFP fluorescence was not used to screen cells with targeted events , as we wanted to develop a general method to isolate marker-free recombinants .
The exchange strategy is detailed in Figure 3A .
We picked 65 ES cell clones resistant to 1 - ( -2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-b-d-arabino-furanosyl ) -5-iodouracil ( FIAU ) due to TK loss and analyzed their <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> by PCR and Southern blot .
Strikingly , 54 proper recombinants were identified , indicating very high RMCE efficiency ( 83 % ) .
RMCE also proved to be precise , as no aberrant bands were detected in PCR and Southern blots ( Figure 3A ) .
p53 + / GFP ES clones were analyzed by western blot with an antibody against p53 , and found to express an additional band at the expected size ( ca. 80 kDa ) .
Surprisingly , the fusion of GFP to p53 apparently altered p53 stability : steady-state levels of p53GFP were much higher than those of <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> p53 ( p53WT ) in unstressed cells , and did not vary significantly after <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage , so that the levels for both p53WT and p53GFP were similar after adriamycin treatment ( Figure 3A ) .
Six independent p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / GFP clones were injected into blastocysts and transferred to pseudo-pregnant females using standard procedures .
Strikingly , no pregnancies were obtained .
It has been shown that the p53 pathway is regulated very differently in ES and somatic cells : ES cells contain relatively high p53 levels and lack the p53-mediated <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage responses found in somatic cells ( 18 ) .
This , together with the observation that p53 levels decrease during mouse embryogenesis ( 19 ) , suggested an explanation for the observed lack of pregnancies : we speculate that the high levels of p53GFP in the ES cells injected into blastocysts might have prevented normal embryonic development once these cells began to differentiate and the p53 pathway became functional .
To test this possibility , we performed RMCE with a p53 <termsem="SO:0000287"> <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> gene </term> in which the p53 <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> ( PRD ) was <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> ( p53P ) , and the p53P was fused to GFP .
We used this <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutant </term> because <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleting </term> the <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> - rich <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> decreases stability and compromises <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - damage responses in vivo ( 5 ) .
According to our hypothesis , this hypomorphic <termsem="SO:0001060"> mutant </term> should not prevent embryonic development .
RMCE with a p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0000048"> replacement </term> <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> was again very efficient and western blots revealed an additional band of the predicted molecular weight only in p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / PGFP ES cells ( Figure 3B ) .
As expected , the PRD <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> correlated with lower expression levels : p53PGFP was much less abundant than p53WT in all p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / PGFP clones ( Figure 3B ) .
We next determined whether p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / PGFP ES cells could generate chimeric mice and transmit the <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> through the germline .
Two p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / PGFP ES cell clones were injected into blastocysts and highly chimeric ( > 80 % ) mice were obtained .
Heterozygote pups were recovered from the mating the chimeras with <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> mice ( Figure 3C ) .
These data demonstrate that marker-free RMCE is very efficient in ES cells and allows germline transmission of a targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> ( see Figure 1 , path A ) .
We next determined whether the RMCE approach could be used to target <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> at the p53 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in somatic cells ( Figure 1 , path B ) .
We first verified that the RMCE-ready p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> ( p53RMCE ) could be transmitted through the germline by mating p53RMCE / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> chimeras with p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  mice ( 20 ) ( Figure 4 ) .
Importantly , this allowed us to generate p53RMCE /  MEFs , which were used to test RMCE at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> in somatic cells .
We first attempted RMCE in MEFs by electroporating p53RMCE /  MEFs with a Cre-expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> and the p53GFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> , followed by selection with FIAU or ganciclovir .
Strikingly , no clones with an exchanged <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were identified ( data not shown ) .
RMCE with p53GFP in ES cells showed that p53GFP is expressed at high levels ( Figure 3A ) , and as mentioned before , the p53 pathway that can be activated in MEFs is not readily activated in ES cells ( 18 ) .
The results above suggest that high levels of p53GFP could be tolerated by ES cells but toxic to MEFs , so that MEFs in which an RMCE had occurred failed to proliferate .
To test this possibility , p53RMCE /  MEFs were electroporated with the p53GFP <termsem="SO:0000048"> replacement </term> <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> with or without a Cre-expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> , then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 48 h after electroporation .
The experiment was done without selection to enable observation of cells under conditions where a failure to proliferate would not derive from FIAU or ganciclovir toxicity but rather solely from the effects of p53GFP .
We observed a few fluorescent cells only when the Cre expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> was co-electroporated , suggesting that such cells resulted from RMCE .
Importantly , the rare fluorescent cells had a flat , ` fried-egg ' appearance typical of senescent cells ( Figure 5A ) , and when plates were observed 5 days later , the cells had detached .
Altogether , the results suggest that RMCE can give rise to p53GFP-expressing MEFs , but they die rapidly owing to p53GFP toxicity .
We also performed RMCE in p53RMCE /  MEFs with the p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> .
p53PGFP-expressing MEFs were viable , recovered with an efficiency of  40 % , and , as expected from ES cell experiments , expressed a p53PGFP protein at much lower levels than p53WT ( Figure 5B ) .
Unlike <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> MEFs , p53P/P MEFs are unable to arrest cycling after irradiation ( 5 ) .
Likewise , we found that irradiation doses that arrested p53RMCE /  MEFs ( which express a <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> p53 from the RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> , see Figure 2 ) did not arrest p53PGFP /  MEFs ( Figure 5C ) .
These data show that a single RMCE-ASAP reaction in heterozygous MEFs enables detection of a recessive phenotype .
The results confirm that <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleting </term> the <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> rich <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> leads to less active p53 with impaired cell cycle control , and also indicate that a GFP <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal </term> fusion can dramatically alter p53 regulation .
A summary of our results is presented in Table 1 .
These data report the development and implementation of an improved RMCE approach that enables efficient <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> <termsem="SO:0000041"> modification </term> in ES cells to generate mice and in heterozygous MEFs to accelerate phenotypic analyses .
The success of RMCE-ASAP relied on the integrated use of <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> heterologous <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> , a positive/negative selection marker that preserves the germline capacity of ES cells , and , for somatic cells , the existence of a knock-out <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of interest .
These characteristics should make RMCE-ASAP a robust and general technology for analysis of mammalian <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> under conditions that preserve normal control mechanisms in different tissues .
In addition , RMCE-ASAP could be used to generate fibroblastic cell lines tailored for the repeated targeting of widely studied <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( p53 , c-myc , NF-KB , etc. ) .

Rationale for a RMCE-ASAP .
Using homologous recombination , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of interest ( GOI , open boxes : <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> ) , is targeted with a <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> <termsem="SO:0000046"> introducing </term> upstream of <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding regions </term> one <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> ( blue arrowhead ) and downstream , a positive/negative selection <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> ( red box ) and a second <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> heterologous <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> ( purple arrowhead ) to create RMCE-ready ES cells .
An exchange is performed in these cells by co-transfecting a Cre expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> and a marker-free <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> with a <termsem="SO:0000359"> floxed </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> GOI ( green box : <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> ) , to produce a <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> mouse ( path A ) .
Importantly RMCE-ASAP incorporates two major improvements over classical RMCE ( path B ) : ( i ) the positive/negative selection <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> does not prevent germline transmission , so that RMCE-ready mice can be obtained ; ( ii ) the selection <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> does not <termsem="SO:0000048"> replace </term> , but rather lies downstream of the GOI .
This is a crucial requirement for accelerated phenotyping in somatic cells , as maintaining a functional GOI ensures that the RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> still behaves like a <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
Hence , after breeding the RMCE-ready mouse with mice heterozygotes for the GOI , somatic cells with an RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> and a <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> or KO <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> can be recovered [ e.g. RMCE / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> and RMCE /  mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) ] .
Such cells , phenotypically similar to <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> and <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  cells , can then be used for phenotypic analyses of dominant or recessive <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> after a single exchange .
Generating ES cells with a p53 RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
The p53 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is contained in a 17 kb-long EcoRI ( RI ) <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> ( black boxes : <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequences </term> , white boxes : <termsem="SO:0000203"> UTRs </term> ) .
The Flox targeting <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> ( below ) , the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> which was verified before use ( Materials and Methods ) , contains ( i ) a 3.4 kb-long 5  homology <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ; ( ii ) 0.2 kb upstream of <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequences </term> , an EcoRI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> and L3 , a <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> [ loxP257 , ( 14 ) ] ; ( iii ) p53 <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> ; ( iv ) 0.4 kb downstream , a puroTK <termsem="SO:0000287"> <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> gene </term> ( puDTK ) for positive/negative selection ( 21 ) and an <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> ( 1L ) ; ( v ) a 1.2 kb-long 3  homology <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> and ( vi ) the diphteria -toxin ( DTA ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> for targeting enrichment .
The recombinants resulting from the depicted crossing-overs are identified by a 6.5 kb band in Southern blot with <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> A and a 3 kb band by PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> a and b .
A representative Southern , and PCR of one positive (  ) and two negative clones , are shown .
Performing RMCE in ES cells .
( A ) RMCE with a p53GFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> .
The exchange <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> , the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> which was verified before use , contains p53GFP <termsem="SO:0000851"> coding sequences </term> <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by L3 and 1L <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> .
It was electroporated with a Cre expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> .
FIAU-resistant clones were analyzed by PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> b and c and Southern blot with <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> B. Both approaches led to identical results and identified 54/65 RMCE recombinants .
Representative clones ( P -- Z ) are shown ( left ) , analyzed by PCR ( top ) and Southern ( bottom ) : all clones but Q and T are positive with both assays .
All positive clones produced a band of the expected size by PCR , indicating correct recombination at 1L , and displayed only the expected 12 and 5 kb bands by Southern , indicating correct recombination at L3 .
The absence of bands of aberrant size in Southerns also indicated that the exchange <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> was neither rearranged nor <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> at ectopic <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> .
Thus RMCE was efficient and accurate .
Recombinant clones were analyzed by western blot with an antibody to p53 .
In the representative western ( right ) , cells from two independent p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / GFP ES clones were left untreated or treated with adriamycin ( ADR ) at 0.5 g/ml for 24 h , and protein extracts were prepared .
p53GFP migrated at the expected size of 80 kDa and was expressed at unexpectedly high levels regardless of stress .
( B ) RMCE with a p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> .
The p53PGFP exchange <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> ( which <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> was verified before use ) differed from the p53GFP <termsem="SO:0001037"> construct </term> only in that it contains a <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 4 ( 4 * ) encoding a PRD <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletion </term> .
RMCE was again very efficient , with 10/12 FIAU-resistant clones producing a 3 kb band by PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> b and c .
A western analysis of four FIAU-resistant clones is shown below ( with low/high exposures : Lo X/Hi X ) .
As expected , all except clone x expressed p53PGFP .
p53PGFP migrated at the expected size of 75 kDa and accumulated after stress , but at lower levels than p53WT .
( C ) Germline transmission of the p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> of seven littermates ( U42 -- U48 ) , obtained from mating a p53PGFP chimera with a <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> mouse , was analyzed by PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> d and e ( see B ) , with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> from <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> , p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / P and p53P/P MEFs ( 5 ) as controls .
U45 , a p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> / PGFP mouse , demonstrated transmission of the <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> .
Germline transmission of the p53 RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> .
p53RMCE / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> ES cells were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice .
Chimeras ( > 80 % ) were then mated with p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  mice ( Taconic ) and MEFs were prepared .
MEFs were first genotyped by PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> a and b ( see Figure 2 ) to detect the PuroTK marker of the RMCE <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> ( top ) .
This revealed germline transmission of the p53 RMCE-ready <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> in MEFs 1 , 2 and 6 .
Each of these three MEF clones was further analyzed ( bottom ) with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> f and g ( left lanes ) and h and i ( right lanes ) , routinely used to genotype p53 <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> /  mice ( <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in Materials and Methods ) .
<termsem="SO:0000112"> Primers </term> f and g amplify a 320 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> from a <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> or RMCE <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> , while <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> h and i specifically amplify a 150 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> from the Neo marker in the KO <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
MEF 1 are p53RMCE / <termsem="SO:0000817"> + </term> and MEFs 2 and 6 are p53RMCE /  cells .
Performing RMCE in MEFs .
( A ) RMCE with the p53GFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> leads to the transient observation of cells with intense nuclear fluorescence .
p53RMCE /  MEFs , electroporated with a Cre expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> and the p53GFP exchange <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> , were analyzed 48 h later by fluorescence microscopy .
A typical field ( left to right : fluorescence , phase contrast , merged ) with a fluorescent cell ( arrow ) is shown .
The fluorescent cell is enlarged ( extreme right ) .
( B ) RMCE with the p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> .
p53RMCE /  MEFs , electroporated with a Cre expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> and the p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> , were selected with ganciclovir .
PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> d and e ( Figure 3B ) indicated that 9/22 ganciclovir-resistant clones <termsem="SO:0000046"> integrated </term> the P <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> [ top row , a representative analysis of 10 clones ( Q -- Z ) is shown ] .
PCR with <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> b and c next verified that the detected PRD <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletions </term> resulted from RMCE at the p53 <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> , not random <termsem="SO:0000046"> integration </term> ( middle row , as expected clones R , S , T and W are positive , but not Q ) .
Western analysis of positive clones ( bottom row ) showed that p53PGFP accumulated after ADR , but at lower levels than p53WT .
( C ) Phenotypic assay of p53PGFP : loss of cell cycle control .
Asynchronous p53RMCE /  and p53PGFP /  MEFs left untreated , or irradiated with doses of 6 or 12 Gy , were analyzed ( top shows a typical experiment ; bottom plots results from  4 independent experiments and  3 independent MEFs ) .
Note that the p53RMCE <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> encodes a <termsem="SO:0000817"> WT </term> p53 .
Summary of targeting experiments .
In ES cells , targeting p53PGFP or p53GFP by RMCE was  20 times more efficient than targeting Flox by homologous recombination .
In MEFs , due to p53GFP toxicity , only the targeting efficiency of RMCE with p53PGFP could be evaluated .
Importantly , a phenotypic read-out of the p53PGFP <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in MEFs , if it had been performed after targeting in fibroblasts by homologous recombination , would have required two rounds of inefficient targeting to target both p53 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
