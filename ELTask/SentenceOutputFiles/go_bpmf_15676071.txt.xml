<termsem="GO:0007416"> Synaptogenesis </term> and outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> are perturbed in the neural retina of Crx mutant mice .
In Leber 's congenital amaurosis ( LCA ) , affected individuals are blind , or nearly so , from <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
This early onset suggests abnormal development of the neural retina .
Mutations in genes that affect the development and/or function of photoreceptor cells have been found to be responsible in some families .
These examples include mutations in the photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> , Crx .
A Crx mutant strain of mice was <termsem="GO:0000003"> created </term> to serve as a model for LCA and to provide more insight into Crx 's function .
In this study , an ultrastructural analysis of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> retina in Crx mutant mice was performed .
Outer segment <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> was found to be blocked at the elongation stage , leading to a failure in <termsem="GO:0022607"> production </term> of the <termsem="GO:0007602"> phototransduction </term> apparatus .
Further , Crx - / - photoreceptors demonstrated severely abnormal synaptic endings in the outer plexiform layer .
This is the first report of a <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> defect in an animal model for LCA .
These data confirm the essential role this gene plays in multiple aspects of <termsem="GO:0042461"> photoreceptor development </term> and extend our understanding of the basic pathology of LCA .
Photoreceptor cells play a primary role in <termsem="GO:0007601"> vision </term> by capturing light energy and converting it into neural stimuli .
These <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons are a shared element in all organisms capable of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensing </term> light .
In humans , genetic diseases of the eye are common and the primary site of disease is most frequently photoreceptors ( for review see [ 1-3 ] ) .
Photoreceptors have been well studied , particularly with respect to the biochemistry and physiology of <termsem="GO:0007602"> phototransduction </term> .
Insight into the development of vertebrate photoreceptors , however , has lagged behind our understanding of function .
Only recently have the first molecular mechanisms <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> <termsem="GO:0042461"> photoreceptor development </term> been identified ( for review see , [ 2,4 ] ) .
Crx ( cone-rod homeobox ) is an otx-family homeobox gene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> predominantly in photoreceptors , from early in their <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> through to the adult ages [ 5-7 ] .
Crx <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> is critically dependent upon Otx2 , another member of the same homeobox family which is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in early photoreceptor cells [ 8 ] .
In rod photoreceptors , Crx appears to work in concert with Nrl , a leucine zipper protein that is also restricted in its <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the retina to rod photoreceptors [ 9 ] .
Many photoreceptor-specific genes have putative Crx-<termsem="GO:0005488">binding </term> elements in their <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory </term> regions [ 10 ] , including rhodopsin [ 11 ] and arrestin [ 12 ] .
Mutations in Crx have been associated with several human diseases that lead to blindness , including cone-rod dystrophy 2 [ 6,13,14 ] , retinitis pigmentosa [ 14 ] , and LCA [ 14-16 ] .
Based on these data , Crx was hypothesized to play a critical role in the differentiation and maintainance of photoreceptor cells [ 5,7 ] .
LCA is the most severe genetic disease of photoreceptors ( see [ 17 ] , for recent review ) .
Affected infants exhibit a complete or near complete absence of <termsem="GO:0007601"> vision </term> from <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
Mutations in retinal specific genes , such as Crx , have been associated with LCA [ 14,15 ] , as well as GUCY2D [ 18 ] , RPE65 [ 19 ] , AIPL-1 [ 20 ] , CRB-1 [ 21 ] , and RPGRIP-1 [ 22 ] .
There also may be as many as three additional genetically linked loci where genes have not been identified [ 23 ] .
Crx mutations in LCA are varied , and include a putative dominant mutation that is proposed to encode a dominant-negative form of Crx [ 14,15 ] .
Recessive mutations also have been reported and at least one allele encodes a protein with decreased <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> activity [ 16 ] .
Histopathological and ultrastructural studies of LCA should enable a better understanding of the disease process , and the design of suitable therapies .
Few such studies exist for human LCA ( reviewed in [ 17 ] ) and the majority of such studies examine the globes of adults with LCA , after the tissue has undergone secondary changes .
Only a single study exists where the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> eye of an infant was examined [ 24 ] .
Animal models for LCA have recently been reported and have already served to broaden our understanding of the pathology of this disease [ 25-28 ] .
Since LCA is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder , additional mouse models are in order to allow a full understanding of the many ways in which <termsem="GO:0042461"> photoreceptor development </term> can go awry .
In addition to their importance as a locus of disease , photoreceptor cells serve as an excellent model for studies in neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Photoreceptor cells are highly <termsem="GO:0030010"> polarized </term> .
At their apex , these neurons have a membranous outer segment , which contains proteins involved in the <termsem="GO:0007602"> phototransduction cascade </term> .
Loss of function mutations in rhodopsin [ 29 ] , or the structural protein , peripherin [ 30 ] , result in an inability to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> outer segments .
At the other extremity , photoreceptors terminate with synaptic endings that make contact with the processes of horizontal and bipolar cells [ 31,32 ] .
Rod spherules <termsem="GO:0022607"> establish </term> an invaginating synapse with rod bipolar dendrites and axonal endings of horizontal cells .
This synapse is characterized by the presence of a ribbon in the presynaptic cytoplasm .
Cone pedicles <termsem="GO:0022607"> make </term> invaginating synapses with the dendrites of on-cone bipolar cells and horizontal cells and basal junctions with the dendrites of off-cone bipolar cells .
The factors <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> the formation of the photoreceptor synapses are completely unknown .
At least one photoreceptor synaptic protein , HRG4 , contains a potential Crx target sequence in its <termsem="GO:0045449"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> regulatory </term> sequence [ 33 ] .
Few studies of LCA animal models have extended their examination of retinal pathology to the ultrastructural level .
Certain features of neuronal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , such as <termsem="GO:0007416"> synapse formation </term> , can be detected definitively at this level of analysis .
With the hope of understanding the neuropathology of LCA in greater detail , we have analyzed the <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> of the outer retina in Crx - / - mice at the ultrastructural level .
These retinas exhibit several prominent defects .
Crx - / - photoreceptors demonstrate a complete block in outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> at the elongation stage .
Further , these cells exhibit abnormal synaptic morphology , thereby broadening the function of Crx to photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> .
This represents the first report strongly implicating the <termsem="GO:0007416"> process of synapse formation </term> in LCA .
Multiple pathologies in the outer segment layer in Crx - / - mice .
A standard knock-out protocol was used to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> mice in which the homeodomain of Crx - / - was targeted and deleted .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of these Crx - / - mice has been reported elsewhere [ 34 ] .
In this study , in order to characterize further the role of Crx in <termsem="GO:0008594"> photoreceptor morphogenesis </term> , the outer retinae from Crx - / - mice were examined using transmission electron microscopy .
At postnatal day 21 ( P21 ) , when Crx + / + photoreceptors exhibited robust outer segments ( Figure 1A , os ) , Crx - / - retinas were without a recognizable outer segment layer ( Figure 1B ) .
Crx - / - photoreceptors had inner segments , demonstrating at least limited photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0030010"> polarization </term> in the Crx mutant , but the inner segments were extremely short ( Figure 2 ) .
Furthermore , the majority of inner segments showed some morphological <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , having approximately as many mitochondria as the control ( Figure 1 and 2 ) .
Occasionally , an inner segment undergoing <termsem="GO:0019835"> lysis </term> was noted , appearing swollen or with vacuoles and swollen mitochondria ( data not shown ) .

Photoreceptor inner segments and outer segments are joined by a non-motile connecting cilium that exhibits a characteristic 9 + 0 arrangement of microtubule doublets when viewed in cross-section .
At P21 , in Crx - / - retinas , numerous cross sections of connecting cilia were noted ( Figure 3A and 3B ) .
Sporadically , connecting cilia contained other than the typical complement of microtubule doublets .
For example , in Figure 3A , the connecting cilium labelled by arrowhead 1 , shows 7 + 0 doublets .
The majority exhibited the characteristic 9 + 0 doublets ( arrowhead 2 and 3 in Figure 3A and Figure 3B ) .
These observations indicate that in addition to inner segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> , <termsem="GO:0042384"> ciliogenesis </term> is also largely intact in Crx - / - photoreceptors .
Further , in Crx - / - retinas the retinal pigmented epithelium ( PE ) appeared normal , at least up to P21 ( data not shown ) , the oldest age examined .

Nonmotile connecting cilia were observed in cross section ( arrowheads 1,2 , and 3 , for examples ) .
Connecting cilium 1 ( arrowhead 1 ) demonstrated seven microtuble doublets , while cilium 2 and cilium 3 exhibited nine .
In A , a displaced cell nucleus ( n ) appearing <termsem="GO:0030263"> pyknotic </term> and abnormal deposition of matrix ( mx ) material of unknown identity were seen , along with large amounts of membranous vesicles ( arrow ) which filled the photoreceptor space and appeared to be released from inner segments .

Scale bar = 1 m .
In addition to the complete absence of outer segments , Crx - / - retinas exhibited three other notable pathologies in the outer segment layer .
First , an abnormal deposition of matrix of unknown identity was noted ( Figure 3A , mx ) .
Second , sporadically displaced nuclei were found <termsem="GO:0051179"> residing </term> in the space abutting the PE .
Occasionally , these nuclei appeared <termsem="GO:0030263"> pyknotic </term> ( Figure 3A , n ) ; but , more frequently exhibited the heterochromatin pattern typical of photoreceptors ( data not shown ) , strongly suggesting that they belonged to ectopic photoreceptors .
The third pathological entity noted in the outer segment layer were numerous small vesicles ( Figure 3A arrow ) 100 to 200 nm in diameter .
They appeared to be emerging from the inner segments , as scanning electron microscopic images showed spherical structures <termsem="GO:0006900"> budding </term> from the inner segments ( Figure 3C , arrow ) .
In order to characterize further the morphogenesis of Crx - / - photoreceptors , the <termsem="GO:0022607"> developing </term> outer segment layer was viewed by scanning electron microscopy at P7 , P14 and P21 ( Figure 4 ) .
In Crx + / + retinas , photoreceptor inner segments , connecting cilia , and the first rudimentary outer segment structures were noted at P7 .
In the Crx - / - retina , only an occassional connecting cilium was noted emerging from inner segments at this stage ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
This observation was confirmed by comparison with transmission electron micrographs ( Figure 5 ) .
These differences are the earliest noted differences between Crx + / + and Crx - / - photoreceptors .
At P14 , elongating outer segments were noted on Crx + / + photoreceptors , occasionally demonstrating a paddle-like structure at their apex ( Figure 4C , os ) .
In Crx - / - retinae , the vast majority of photoreceptors at this stage demonstrated connecting cilia without outer segments ( Figure 4D , cc ) .
Sporadically , Crx - / - photoreceptors would exhibit an irregular structure extending from a connecting cilium ( Figure 4D , cc * ) perhaps representing a malformed outer segment .
Such structures were also observed at P21 ( Figure 4F , cc * ) .
These putative , abnormal outer segments were only rarely noted in Crx + / + at P14 , and never at P21 ( Figure 4C and 4E , cc * ) .
Further , in Crx - / - photoreceptors , unusually long connecting cilia were noted ( Figure 4F , cc ) .
Serial examination of Crx - / - photoreceptors at P7 , P10 , P14 , and P21 by TEM , demonstrated a distinctive lack of any structure interpretable as orderly stacks of discs or <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> discs .
These data demonstrate a complete absence of normal outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> in the Crx mutant mouse , and the arrest of <termsem="GO:0022607"> development </term> of the photoreceptor appendage at the elongation stage of outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> .
Outer segment <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> in Crx - / - photoreceptors .
Scanning electron microscopy of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> photoreceptors viewed from the scleral side with the pigmented epithelium removed at P7 , P14 , and P21 for Crx + / + ( A , C , and E ) and Crx - / - ( B , D , F ) littermates .
In Crx + / + retina , numerous connecting cilia ( A , cc ) were evident at P7 with rudimentary outer segments .
After P7 , in Crx + / + outer segment elongation occurs .
Initially , outer segments have a paddle-like structure ( C , os ) which is later shed ( E , os ) .
In Crx - / - photoreceptors , few connecting cilia were observed at P7 ( B , cc ) .
After P7 , connecting cilia were more numerous and occasionally a malformed outer segment was noted extending from a connecting cilium ( D and F , cc * ) .
These were rarely observed in Crx + / + and only at P14 ( C , cc * ) .
At P21 , abnormally long connecting cilia are noted in Crx - / - ( F , cc ) .

( B ) Crx - / - photoreceptors exhibited connecting cilia ( cc ) at this early stage , however , nascent outer segment structures were not observed .
Scale Bar = 1 m .
Finally , the morphology of the malformed Crx - / - photoreceptors was compared to rhodopsin - / - and peripherin - / - photoreceptors .
Rhodopsin and peripherin are two photoreceptor-specific genes whose <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is significantly <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in the Crx - / - retinae [ 10,34,35 ] .
Loss of function mutations in each of these genes separately have been reported to result in a failure to elaborate outer segments [ 29,30 ] .
Photoreceptors from these two mutant mice examined by SEM from the scleral side appeared highly similar to Crx - / - photoreceptors ( compare Figure 4F to Figure 6A and 6B ) .

Crx is necessary for the <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> of photoreceptor terminals .
In a previous study , we demonstrated that forced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of a dominant-negative allele of Crx in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> rods blocked <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> of both rod spherules in the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) and outer segments [ 7 ] .
To expand on these studies , the ultrastructure of photoreceptor synapses was examined in Crx - / - retinas .
In Crx + / + retinas at P21 , newly mature rod spherules were abundant ( Figure 7A ) .
The sperules were blunt or club-shaped structures with a single ribbon associated with a single invaginating synapse ( Figure 7A , arrow indicates one example ; Figure 8A and 8B ) .
Two processes from horizontal cells were situated on either side of the synaptic ridge ( Figure 8B , labelled H ) and one or more dendrites of rod bipolar cells occupied a central position ( Figure 8B , bipolar labelled B ) .
Cone terminals are large , flat pedicles that exhibit many invaginating synapses containing separate sets of horizontal and bipolar cell processes .
Each pedicle contains numerous ribbons .
These terminals were much less common than spherules in Crx + / + retinas at P21 ( Figure 7 , box ) .
In the OPL of Crx - / - retinas , photoreceptor terminals were highly disorganized at P21 ( Figure 7B , arrows ) .
Processes containing synaptic vesicles and ribbon-like structures were apparent , suggesting at least limited <termsem="GO:0022607"> generation </term> of synapse components .
However , well <termsem="GO:0022607"> formed </term> spherules and pedicles were not observed .
In addition , many terminals appeared to contain multiple ribbons ( Figure 8C and 8D , r ) not tethered to the plasma membrane and occasionally in perinuclear positions ( Figure 8D ) .

( A ) In Crx + / + retina at P21 , newly <termsem="GO:0022607"> formed </term> rod spherules were abundant ( arrow demonstrates one example ) .
The spherules were club-shaped and contained a single invaginating synapse with one ribbon complex .
Cone terminals <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> large , flat pedicles that contain many invaginating synapses with separate ribbon structures .
These terminals were more scarce , but apparent in Crx + / + retinas at P21 ( one example in box ) .
( B ) In the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) of Crx - / - retinas , photoreceptor terminals appeared highly disorganized at P21 ( arrows ) .
Well-<termsem="GO:0022607"> formed </term> pedicles and spherules were not evident .
Putative terminals containing ribbon-like structures were apparent , suggesting at least limited <termsem="GO:0022607"> generation </term> of synapse components .
Many terminals appeared to contain multiple ribbon-like structures , instead of a singule ribbon .
For example , terminal 1 and 2 contained two ribbons each , whereas terminal 3 appeared to contain only one .

In this study , an ultrastructural analysis of Crx - / - photoreceptors was carried out .
As Crx mutations have been associated with Leber 's congenital amaurosis , the findings in this study broaden our understanding of the pathology of this disease .
Two prominent pathologies were characterized in the Crx - / - retina : ( 1 ) An absolute block in outer segment <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> was noted , with the block occuring at the elongation stage of outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> ; ( 2 ) Crx - / - photoreceptors exhibited a severe perturbation in <termsem="GO:0007416"> synapse formation </term> .
This represents the first report of a <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> defect in an animal model of LCA .
Crx - / - photoreceptors can not complete outer segment <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> .
Mutations in Crx represent one of a collection of gene mutations that lead to an outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> defect .
Homozygous null mutations in the peripherin/RDS gene [ 36 ] or in rhodopsin [ 29 ] lead to a failure of outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> .
The deficits in peripherin - / - and Crx - / - <termsem="GO:0008594"> photoreceptor morphogenesis </term> were found to be very similar .
Vesicular structures in Crx - / - photoreceptors were observed that were similar to those previously noted in the rds/peripherin - / - mouse .
It was initially proposed that these vesicles were due to the breakdown of outer segment membranes that were not properly <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruited </term> to the outer segments in the absence of peripherin , or were from the result of the <termsem="GO:0022411"> breakdown </term> of the microvilli of Mller cells [ 30 ] .
Strong support in favor of the former explanation was provided by Nir and colleagues who demonstrated the presence of rhodopsin protein in these vesicles using immunoelectron microscopy against a rhodopsin epitope [ 37 ] .
Further , as shown here , the vesicles appear to <termsem="GO:0006900"> bud </term> from the inner segments themselves .
In <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> photoreceptors , an extraordinary <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth process </term> occurs whereby the outer segment is <termsem="GO:0022607"> generated </term> from the nascent connecting cilium ( see [ 38 ] and references therein ) .
Peripherin/RDS and ROM-1 proteins ( <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> in disc rims ) and the opsin proteins ( <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> throughout the discs ) have important roles in the structural integrity of mature outer segments ( see [ 39,29 ] ) .
ROM-1 - / - mice <termsem="GO:0022607"> produce </term> disorganized outer segments with large disks [ 40 ] .
Crx , by virtue of being a <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> , presumably <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> genes that are responsible for the <termsem="GO:0022607"> building </term> and perhaps maintenance of the outer segment structure , including rhodopsin and peripherin .
Using northern blots [ 34 ] , microarrays [ 10 ] , and serial analysis of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> ( SAGE ) [ 35 ] , we have defined a large number of genes that are altered in their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level in Crx - / - mice .
We found that rhodopsin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was severely diminished in Crx - / - animals , and peripherin mRNA was reduced by approximately 30 % .
Transgenic mice with variable levels of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of wild type rhodopsin exhibit rod degeneration [ 41 ] , indicating the importance of the level of rhodopsin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
In addition , the timing of rhodopsin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> may be very important , as indicated by studies in Drosophila .
In Drosophila , rhodopsin ( ninaE ) is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in photoreceptors R1 -- R6 .
In ninaE null mutants , the rhabdomere , a structure analogous to vertebrate outer segments , fails to <termsem="GO:0022607"> develop </term> in R1 -- R6 photoreceptors [ 42 ] , reminiscent of the situation in rhodopsin - / - mice [ 29 ] .
An intriguing experiment by Kumar et al. [ 43 ] demonstrated a temporal requirement for rhodopsin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> during <termsem="GO:0042052"> rhabdomere development </term> .
In ninaE null flies , a ninaE transgene under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of a heat shock promoter was subjected to various temperature shifts during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Heat shock during the normal time of rhodopsin onset resulted in substantial and long-lasting rescue of photoreceptor structure and transient rescue of photoreceptor physiology .
However , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> shortly before or after this critical period failed to rescue , suggesting that rhodopsin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> during a discrete window of time in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> is essential for proper rhabdomere <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> .
This result is consistent with observations in the rat wherein rhodopsin onset occurs with strict timing in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> history of most rods in vivo [ 44 ] .
Thus , through its <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of rhodopsin levels , or perhaps through <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the kinetics of the <termsem="GO:0048518"> up-regulation </term> of rhodopsin beginning at about P6 , Crx may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> outer segment <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> .
The similarty of the two cases may extend further .
At present , the closest Crx relative in Drosophila is Otd , the founding member of the class of homeobox genes to which Crx belongs .
Interestingly , in one hypomorphic allele of Drosophila otd , otduvi , <termsem="GO:0008594"> photoreceptor morphogenesis </term> is also disrupted [ 45 ] .
We found that there are many other genes that are dependent upon Crx .
Those that are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> at a lower level in the Crx - / - retina , such as rhodopsin and peripherin , comprise many that are either enriched or specific to photoreceptors in their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 35 ] .
They include enzymes that are important in <termsem="GO:0006629"> lipid metabolism </term> , <termsem="GO:0006457"> protein folding </term> and <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> , as well as in other processes that one might envision would be important in <termsem="GO:0022607"> building </term> a structure such as the outer segment .
In situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> using probes from this collection of genes has revealed that some of them have their RNA <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the inner segment , a finding typical for proteins <termsem="GO:0006605"> targeted </term> to the outer segment .
Future analyses of the function of these genes might reveal their role in outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> biogenesis </term> .
Finally , <termsem="GO:0030010"> polarization </term> of photoreceptors was found to be largely intact , as was <termsem="GO:0042384"> ciliogenesis </term> .
Another LCA gene , CRB1 , and a related gene CRB3 , have been implicated in <termsem="GO:0042384"> ciliogenesis </term> in in vitro models [ 46 ] .
The Drosophila homologue of CRB1 , Crumbs , has been implicated in <termsem="GO:0008594"> photoreceptor morphogenesis </term> [ 47 ] .
However , the spontaneously occurring mouse mutant in CRB1 , the Rd8 mouse , <termsem="GO:0022607"> develops </term> shortened outer segments that subsequently degenerate [ 48 ] , suggesting that photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0030010"> polarization </term> and <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> are intact in this mutant .
While CRB1 and Crx have been both linked to LCA , further work is necessary to determine if their function is linked in <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> .
<termsem="GO:0007416"> Synaptogenesis </term> is perturbed in Crx - / - photoreceptors .
The Crx - / - mouse demonstrates the most severe abnormality of photoreceptor synapses reported to date .
The peripherin - / - mouse <termsem="GO:0022607"> develops </term> a normal complement of photoreceptor terminals which then degenerate as the photoreceptors are lost [ 30 ] .
Also , similarly in rhodopsin ( Rho ) and cyclic nucleotide-<termsem="GO:0022836"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gated channel </term> </term> , alpha-3 ( CNGA3 ) double knockout mice ( Rho - / - , CNGA3 - / - ) , synapses are reported to <termsem="GO:0022607"> form </term> normally [ 49 ] .
These observations demonstrate that photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> can occur in the absence of outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> .
In keeping with this observation is the fact that some electroretinogram activity is present in peripherin - / - mice , suggesting that minimal <termsem="GO:0007602"> phototransduction </term> is present in these mice , enough to <termsem="GO:0048518"> drive </term> activity at the photoreceptor synapse .
In vitro studies wherein synapse elements are <termsem="GO:0022607"> formed </term> in the absence of proper outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> development </term> and , therefore , possible absence of light-dependent photoreceptor activity , have indicated the independence of <termsem="GO:0007602"> phototransduction </term> and <termsem="GO:0007416"> synapse formation </term> , at least for the initial stages [ 50,51 ] .
These data then suggest that the fact that the Crx - / - photoreceptors do not have proper synaptic endings is not due to a lack of outer segment <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> .
A more likely explanation is that Crx plays a role in photoreceptor <termsem="GO:0007416"> synapse formation </term> , perhaps by <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> directly , or indirectly , important genes in this process .
Using immunohistochemistry , we examined the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of common pre-synaptic terminal proteins , including KIF3a , SV2 , and synaptophysin , and were unable to observe qualitative differences between Crx - / - and control tissue at P14 ( data not shown ) .
Examination of their RNA levels by SAGE showed no significant difference for all 3 genes , though very few tags were recovered from these genes and thus the analysis of RNA levels may not be significant [ 35 ] .
However , since other genes <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in photoreceptors were significantly altered in their <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> level in the Crx - / - mouse , there are many candidates that could be important for <termsem="GO:0008594"> photoreceptor morphogenesis </term> .
Tags from three genes from proteins <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in photoreceptor terminals were found to be decreased in a statistically significant fashion , namely the HGF-<termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> <termsem="GO:0004713"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> tyrosine kinase </term> </term> substrate , the CRIPT protein , and synaptotagmin 1 ( Blackshaw and Cepko , unpublished data ) .
An example of a gene that was increased in the Crx - / - retina is HRG4 ( a homologue of the C. elegans Unc119 gene ) ( Blackshaw and Cepko , unpublished data ) which encodes a component of the ribbon synapse [ 33 ] .
The fact that it is <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> might indicate a <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to the lack of proper terminal structures .
Several other genes encoding putative cytoskeletal elements also were increased ( e.g. microtubule associated protein 4 ) or decreased ( e.g. cofilin 1 ) in the Crx - / - retina , with P values of < .005 .
It is not known whether any of these genes are involved in <termsem="GO:0022607"> building </term> or <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> synaptic structures , but they are now genes that might lead to a better understanding of the <termsem="GO:0022607"> construction </term> and function of the relatively unique structure of the ribbon synapse .
Abnormal photoreceptor terminal <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> was noted in a study that examined <termsem="GO:0060041"> retinal development </term> in the laminin beta2 chain-deficient mouse [ 52 ] .
Several pathologies were noted in these mice .
First , laminin beta2 chain-deficient mice displayed abnormal outer segment elongation , but a more mild phenotype than that of the Crx - / - mice ; the outer segments were reduced by 50 % in length .
Also photoreceptor terminals were perturbed in laminin beta2 mutants , but again the phenotype was more subtle then that of Crx - / - mice .
The outer plexiform layer of the beta2-deficient retinas demonstrated only 7 % normal invaginating synapses , while the remainder had various pathologies , including floating synaptic ribbons , as seen here .
The mechanistic relationship of these two molecules , if any , in <termsem="GO:0008594"> photoreceptor morphogenesis </term> is unknown to date .
The mRNA for laminin beta2 was not detected in the SAGE study of the relative RNA levels in Crx - / - and Crx + / + and thus we can not comment on whether the levels of RNA for laminin beta2 were altered .
Crx - / - mice are a model for LCA .
Crx has been implicated in three photoreceptor diseases that result in human blindness , cone-rod dystrophy2 , Leber 's congenital amaurosis , and retinitis pigmentosa ( for review , see [ 53 ] ) .
The cone-rod dystrophies ( CRDs ) are characterized by loss of cone-mediated <termsem="GO:0007601"> vision </term> in the first decade of life or later , with concomitant or subsequent loss of rod-mediated <termsem="GO:0007601"> vision </term> [ 54 ] .
Conversely , RP is notable for initial loss of rod function , followed by loss of cone-mediated <termsem="GO:0007601"> vision </term> [ 55 ] .
The majority of known genes responsible for human genetic blindness , encode proteins <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> almost exclusively , or exclusively , in photoreceptors , particularly in the outer segment [ 35 ] .
Many of these proteins are required for <termsem="GO:0007602"> phototransduction </term> or outer segment structure .
The mechanisms whereby mutations in rod-specific genes , such as rhodopsin , lead eventually to cone degeneration in RP remain obscure .
Mutations in Crx were the first , and still one of a very few examples of a <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> mutation leading to photoreceptor disease .
LCA is a disease in which there is little or no photoreceptor function in infancy ; thereby , likely <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> in etiology ( [ 17,56 ] for review ) .
The Crx - / - mouse may be an excellent model for studying the pathology of this disorder , particularly the subtype of the disorder where Crx mutations are involved .
The vast majority of histopathological studies of LCA in human tissue have been derived from adult patients with LCA where secondary changes are likely to be present .
Indeed in animal models of LCA , secondary <termsem="GO:0050896"> reactive </term> and/or degenerative changes occur early after the abnormal formation of retinal tissue [ 57 ] .
The only study in human tissue derived from a human 33-week retina with proposed RPE65 mutations was reported to have abnormal retinae at this early stage [ 24 ] .
These authors report cell loss , including thinning of the photoreceptor layer .
In addition , they claim in the text to have seen aberrant synaptic and inner retinal <termsem="GO:0048532"> organization </term> , although their examination of photoreceptor synapses unfortunately are not presented in the data section of the paper .
Given the scarcity of available human tissue , the characterization of the primary pathology of LCA will require animal models .
In the current study , we present data that argue that , in addition to outer segment <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> , <termsem="GO:0007416"> synaptogenesis </term> may also be critically impaired in at least a subset of LCA .
Crx - / - mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> as reported elsewhere [ 34 ] .
Rhodosin-null mice [ 29 ] were obtained from Paul Sieving ( University of Michigan ) .
Rds mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratory .
Littermate Crx - / - and wildtype pups were perfused in 1 % formaldehyde and 0.5 % glutaraldehyde at various postnatal stages .
The eyes were then enucleated , and the cornea and lens were removed .
The eye cup was immersed in fixative ( 1 % formaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde ) for 3 to 4 hours at 4 C .
The sclera was then partially removed and the retinas were sliced into small pieces and fixed ( 1 % paraformaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde ) overnight at 4 C .
These procedures were found optimal for maintaining the structural integrity of the photoreceptor outer segments .
After fixing , the tissue was washed 2X in PBS for thirty minutes per wash .
The tissue was then postfixed in a 1 % osmium tetroxide/1 .5 % potassium ferrocyanide mixture for 2 hours at 4 C .
Staining was carried out for 30 minutes in 1 % uranyl acetate in maleate buffer ( pH = 6.0 ) at room temperature followed by 1 % tannic acid in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH = 7.4 ) for thirty minutes .
The specimens were then dehydrated and embedded in Epon/Araldite .
Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined in a Jeol JEM-1200EX electron microscope .
Specimens used for SEM required removal of the retinal pigment epithelium ( PE ) , enabling visualization of the outer surface of the neural retina .
Retinae from Crx - / - , rhodopsin - / - , RDS , or wildtype eyes were dissected free from PE in a dispase solution and fixed in 1.25 % glutaraldehyde and 1.0 % formaldehyde overnight at 4 C .
Tissue was then washed 5X in cacodylate buffer and dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol .
Tissues were subsequently critical point dried in carbon dioxide .
All specimens were mounted and coated with sublimated gold-palladium by the sputtering technique .
Micrographs were obtained with a Jeol JSM-35CF scanning electron microscope .
EM and ER conducted transmission electron microscopy .
EM performed scanning electron microscopy .
TF and EM <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> , characterized and maintained the Crx - / - mouse line .
CC participated in the design and coordination of the study and all data analysis .
EM and CC drafted the manuscript .
All authors read and approved the final manuscript .
