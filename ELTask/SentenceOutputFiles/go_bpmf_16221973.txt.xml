Two major branches of anti-cadmium <termsem="GO:0006952"> defense </term> in the mouse : MTF-1 / metallothioneins and glutathione .
<termsem="GO:0010038"> Metal-responsive </term> <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> 1 ( MTF-1 ) <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulates </term> expression of its target genes in response to various stress conditions , notably heavy metal load , via <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to <termsem="GO:0010038"> metal response </term> elements ( MREs ) in the respective enhancer/promoter regions .
Furthermore , it serves a vital function in embryonic <termsem="GO:0001889"> liver development </term> .
However , targeted deletion of Mtf1 in the liver after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> is no longer <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> .
For this study , Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates were both mock - or cadmium-treated and liver-specific <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> was analyzed .
Besides the well-characterized metallothionein genes , several new MTF-1 target genes with MRE motifs in the promoter region emerged .
MTF-1 is required for the basal expression of selenoprotein W , muscle 1 gene ( Sepw1 ) that encodes a <termsem="GO:0043295"> glutathione-binding </term> and putative <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> protein , supporting a role of MTF-1 in the <termsem="GO:0006979"> oxidative stress response </term> .
Furthermore , MTF-1 mediates the cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> gene 1 ( Ndrg1 ) , which is induced by several stress conditions and is overexpressed in many cancers .
MTF-1 is also involved in the <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium response </term> of cysteine - and glycine-rich protein 1 gene ( Csrp1 ) , which is implicated in cytoskeletal organization .
In contrast , MTF-1 <termsem="GO:0048519"> represses </term> the basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Slc39a10 , a putative <termsem="GO:0005385"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> zinc transporter </term> </term> .
In a pathway independent of MTF-1 , cadmium also induced the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> of genes involved in the synthesis and regeneration of glutathione , a <termsem="GO:0046870"> cadmium-binding </term> <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> .
These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense , one via MTF-1 and its target genes , notably metallothioneins , the other via glutathione , with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W. All organisms have evolved mechanisms to cope with a variety of stress situations .
One type of <termsem="GO:0006950"> stress response </term> is triggered by heavy metals , such as zinc , copper and cadmium ( for convenience , the terms zinc , copper and cadmium are also used here to denote Zn2 + , Cu2 + and Cd2 + , respectively ) .
Metallothioneins ( MTs ) , small , cysteine-rich proteins , play an important role in <termsem="GO:0055065"> metal homeostasis </term> and detoxification due to their ability to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> different heavy metal ions ( 1 -- 3 ) .
In the mouse , there are four metallothionein genes , designated as Mt1 to Mt4 .
Basal , as well as heavy metal-induced , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Mt1 and Mt2 is mediated by <termsem="GO:0010038"> metal-responsive </term> <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> 1 ( MTF-1 ) ( 4 -- 7 ) .
This zinc finger protein recognizes short cis-acting DNA sequences , termed <termsem="GO:0010038"> metal response </term> elements ( MREs ; core consensus sequence TGCRCNC ) , which are present in the promoters of target genes ( 8,9 ) .
MTF-1 is conserved in evolution , and homologs have been characterized in the mouse ( 10 ) , humans ( 11 ) , Drosophila ( 12 -- 14 ) and fish ( 15,16 ) .
The role of MTF-1 has been studied most extensively in the mouse .
Besides coping with heavy metal load , MTF-1 can also mediate the induction of Mt genes in response to other stress situations , such as oxidative stress ( 5,17 ) and hypoxia ( 18 ) .
In addition , it is required for the metalloregulation of Znt1 , encoding the major plasma <termsem="GO:0051668"> membrane-localized </term> <termsem="GO:0022883"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> zinc efflux transporter </term> </term> ( 19 ) , the hypoxic/anoxic induction of the gene for placental <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> ( Plgf ) , an <termsem="GO:0001525"> angiogenic </term> protein of the vascular endothelial <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> ( VEGF ) family ( 20 ) , and has recently been invoked in tumor <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( 21,22 ) .
Furthermore , MTF-1 has an essential function during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> : targeted disruption of Mtf1 results in embryonic lethality around 14 days post coitum due to hepatocyte necrosis ( 23 ) .
In contrast , mice with null mutations for the stress-inducible metallothionein genes ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) are viable , though sensitive to cadmium ( 24,25 ) , indicating that additional important MTF-1 target genes are involved in the <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> phenotype .
With the Cre-loxP conditional knockout technique , it is possible to circumvent the embryonic <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> phenotype of conventional Mtf1 knockout mice .
Previous experiments with this technique revealed that deletion of Mtf1 from the liver after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> is no longer <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> under non-stress conditions ( 26 ) .
For this study , an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout mouse line was <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> to perform a search for MTF-1 target genes and cadmium-inducible genes in the adult liver .
A number of target gene candidates emerged upon a transcriptome analysis of mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates and several of these were confirmed by semiquantitative <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCR .
Besides the stress-inducible metallothionein genes that were already known as target genes of MTF-1 , we find that MTF-1 is important for basal liver expression of the gene for selenoprotein W , muscle 1 ( Sepw1 ) as well as for cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> gene 1 ( Ndrg1 ) and the gene encoding cysteine - and glycine-rich protein 1 ( Csrp1 ) .
In addition , MTF-1 appears to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repress </term> the expression of solute <termsem="GO:0005215"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> carrier </term> </term> family 39 , member 10 gene ( Slc39a10 ) , which encodes a putative <termsem="GO:0046873"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metal ion transporter </term> </term> .
In an MTF-1-independent transcriptome <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> , several genes involved in <termsem="GO:0006749"> glutathione metabolism </term> are induced .
Further studies confirmed a dual anti-cadmium <termsem="GO:0006952"> defense </term> , one via glutathione and another one via MTF-1 and its target genes , including metallothioneins .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and liver-specific deletion .
Mtf1 conditional knockout mice were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> in collaboration with Dr Michael Leviten ( San Carlos , CA ) .
Two genomic clones containing exons 3 to 6 of Mtf1 were used to <termsem="GO:0009058"> construct </term> a gene targeting vector for homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> ( Supplementary Data ) .
A neomycin resistance cassette ( <termsem="GO:0004618"> <termsem="GO:0050191"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> PGK </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> ) flanked by two loxP sites was cloned into the SacI site 5  of exon 3 of Mtf1 , the third loxP site was cloned into the ScaI site 3  of exon 4 .
A <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> thymidine kinase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> ) cassette was inserted in the HpaI site 3  of exon 6 .
129 ES cells were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector , selected in the presence of G418 and FIAU , and screened for correct integration events by PCR and Southern blot analysis .
Transient <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> led to removal of the <termsem="GO:0004618"> <termsem="GO:0050191"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> PGK </term> </term> </term> - <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> cassette , and mice carrying the modified Mtf1loxP allele were <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by injection of positive clones into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and subsequent crosses .
Homozygous conditional knockout animals ( Mtf1loxP/loxP ) were crossed with the Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> transgenic line Mx-cre ( a gift from Prof. Michel Aguet ) to obtain an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout line .
The mice were genotyped by PCR using the following primers ( Microsynth ) : Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> : 5  - CTATCCAGCAACATTTGGGCCAGC-3  ; 5  - CCAGGTTACGGATATAGTTCATGAC-3  , Mtf1loxP or wild-type allele : 5  - CACACCCAGTTTGTGTATGTCTTC-3  ; 5  - CAGTCACAAGCAAATTACCAAACACTGCC-3  .
At 8 weeks of age , male Mtf1loxP/loxP mice harboring the Mx-cre transgene ( Mtf1loxP/loxP Mx-cre , abbr. : Mtf1Mx-cre ) and control littermates without transgene ( Mtf1loxP/loxP , abbr. : Mtf1loxP ) received four intraperitoneal injections each of 300 g synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic -- polycytidylic acid [ pI -- pC ; Sigma ; in a volume of 60 l phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ] at 3 day intervals .
Only in the case of <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> studies with MRE sequences from MTF-1 target gene candidates , the control mice received no pI -- pC injections .
For experiments with metal treatment , mice received 2 days after the last pI -- pC treatment a subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection of either 20 mol/kg body weight CdSO4 ( 2 mM CdSO4 in H2O ; cadmium treatment ) or 10 ml/kg body weight H2O ( mock treatment ) 6 h before sacrificing them .
Microarray analysis and data processing .
Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment ; all male ) essentially as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 27 ) .

Genes were considered to be differentially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> if there was at least a 2-fold difference in <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> levels of the compared experimental groups ( genotype and respective treatment ) .
The result was considered reliable if signal values for the respective gene were scored ` present ' at least for all mice in one experimental group or for two mice in each of two groups .
To screen for the presence of the MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC in the promoter region , the upstream sequences of the respective genes were obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) Genome Browser Database ( ; October/November 2004 ) ( 28 ) .

Primary embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from a 12.5 day old Mtf1loxP mouse embryo and <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( ICN ) , 100 U/ml penicillin -- streptomycin ( Gibco BRL ) and 2 mM l-glutamine ( Gibco BRL ) .
100 mm plates with primary cells were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with 10 g of an <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> plasmid coding for simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) large T antigen <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter , using lipofectamine  reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cell foci were isolated and the immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line ckoC was derived from one of them .
The Mtf1loxP genotype of this line as well as the genomic integration of the T antigen were confirmed by PCR .
100 mm plates with these cells were further <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> by the calcium phosphate method ( 30 ) with 19.6 g of an <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> plasmid for Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by the CMV promoter and 0.4 g of an <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> plasmid for the neomycin resistance gene under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the <termsem="GO:0004797"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TK </term> </term> promoter .
Stably <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> cells were selected in the presence of 0.4 g/l G418 ( Calbiochem ) , isolated clones of resistant cells were harvested and <termsem="GO:0040007"> grown </term> independently , and the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> and excision of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 were analyzed by <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCR .
The cell lines delC19 , delC21 and delC23 with a deletion of Mtf1 were chosen for further experiments .
Samples of 1  104 cells/well were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to <termsem="GO:0007155"> adhere </term> for 24 h .
The cells were then pre-incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0 , 5 , 10 , 25 or 50 M l-buthionine - [ S , R ] - sulfoximine ( BSO ) ( Sigma ) , a drug that inhibits <termsem="GO:0006750"> glutathione synthesis </term> ( 31 ) .
Later , cells were exposed to 0 , 5 , 10 or 20 M CdCl2 in the specified pre-incubation medium for an additional 24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT ( 3 - [ 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromid ) - based <termsem="GO:0008283"> Cell Proliferation </term> Kit I ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout mouse line .
Using a homologous <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombination </term> strategy , mice were obtained with a modified Mtf1 allele Mtf1loxP where exons 3 and 4 , encoding four of the six zinc fingers of the <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> domain , are flanked by loxP sites ( Figure 1a ) .
Mice homozygous for the Mtf1loxP allele were further crossed with animals of the Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> transgenic line Mx-cre .
Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in this line under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of the mouse Mx1 gene promoter , which is inducible by administration of interferon alpha or beta , or synthetic double-stranded RNA pI -- pC ( 32 ) .
Cre-mediated deletion was reported to be complete in the liver , while varying in other tissues , ranging from 94 % in spleen to 8 % in brain ( 32 ) .
After Cre-mediated deletion of exons 3 and 4 , which results in a frameshift and premature <termsem="GO:0006415"> <termsem="GO:0006412"> translation </term> stop </term> , no functional MTF-1 protein can be <termsem="GO:0009058"> produced </term> .
For induction of Cre <termsem="GO:0000150"> <termsem="GO:0009009"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> recombinase </term> </term> </term> , Mtf1 conditional knockout mice harboring the Mx-cre transgene ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) received four intraperitoneal pI -- pC injections at 3 day intervals ( pI -- pC induction ) ; control littermates without transgene ( Mtf1loxP ) received similar injections .
Using <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCRs ( Figure 1b ) , a shortened product was obtained with RNA from Mtf1Mx-cre livers , indicating a successful excision of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in these animals .
On close examination , a very faint band similar in size to full-length signal was also observed in those mice , probably due to a low amount of residual full-length Mtf1 mRNA .
The level of functional MTF-1 protein was examined by EMSA ( Figure 1c ) : MTF-1 protein -- DNA complex was detectable with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse , but no functional MRE - <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> protein was observed with an Mtf1Mx-cre sample .
Thus , deletion of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in the liver of Mtf1Mx-cre mice was virtually complete .
All examined liver-specific knockout mice were viable under laboratory conditions and appeared normal .
MTF-1 target gene search .
For the identification of MTF-1 target genes , we compared the liver transcript profiles of mice with and without functional Mtf1 gene that had been mock-treated or exposed to cadmium ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment ) .
In a first screen , the transcripts were analyzed with a differential display-based method , called amplification of double-stranded cDNA end restriction fragments ( ADDER ) ( 33 ) .
Thereby an overwhelming number of signals was obtained for the two stress-inducible metallothioneins ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) , due to the abundance of their transcripts both in mock-treated and especially in cadmium-treated livers that harbored a functional MTF-1 gene ( data not shown ) .
This result confirmed the importance of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothionein genes .
In a second approach , the <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> profile in livers of the above mentioned mice was compared by Affymetrix GeneChip  Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays ( Table 1 ) .
When analyzing the probe array data of livers from mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice , an at least 2-fold , reliable <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 13 Affymetrix GeneChip  probe sets corresponding to 11 characterized genes ( Table 1 , a ) .
Seven of these genes contain one or more MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC within a segment of 1000 bp upstream of the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start .
For 26 probe sets corresponding to 24 different characterized genes , a 2-fold or higher , reliable <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers ( Table 1 , b ) ; 17 of these 24 genes contain MRE core consensus sequences in the upstream region .
The data set for livers of cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice revealed an at least 2-fold , reliable <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 21 probe sets corresponding to 16 different characterized genes ( Table 1 , c ) ; 10 of these contain MRE core consensus sequences in their upstream region .
For 9 probe sets corresponding to 9 different characterized genes , an at least 2-fold , reliable <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> was detected ( Table 1 , d ) ; five of them contain MRE motifs .
In addition to characterized genes , ESTs and RIKEN cDNA sequences were also found in the comparison of Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP livers to be differentially <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .
<termsem="GO:0048519"> Downregulation </term> of Mt1 and Mt2 was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for both conditions ( though the level of significance for the <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> of Mt1 in mock-treated animals was above 0.05 ; data not shown ) .
For all MTF-1 target genes characterized so far , such as Mt1 , Mt2 and Znt1 , MTF-1 exerts its <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> activation activity via standard MRE sequences located proximal to the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( 4,5,8,18,19 ) .
Even a specific search for MTF-1 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> sites by selection from a pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides with random sequences yielded no new <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> motif for MTF-1 in addition to the known MREs ( 34 ) .
Thus , an MRE sequence is to date the only indication for a direct MTF-1 target gene , and four MRE-containing target gene candidates were further analyzed .
Basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sepw1 depends on MTF-1 .
Sepw1 was found in microarray analysis to be significantly <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in livers from cadmium - and mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice ( Table 1 , a and c ) .
SEPW1 is a selenocysteine-containing protein that <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> glutathione ( 35 ) and is thought to act as an <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> in vivo ( 36 ) .
Sepw1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in livers of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice was further analyzed by semiquantitative <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCRs and S1 analysis ( Figure 2a and b ) .
In accordance with microarray data a slight , if any , upregulation of Sepw1 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> was observed in livers from Mtf1loxP mice upon cadmium treatment .
The basal level was reduced in livers from mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice , indicating that MTF-1 is important for the basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Sepw1 .
Three MRE core consensus sequences were found in the region upstream of the mouse Sepw1 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( Figure 2c ) .
Two of them in opposite orientation overlap almost completely proximal to the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( MRE1 ,  40 bp ) , the third one is located further upstream ( MRE2 ,  527 bp ) .
Specific <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> of MTF-1 to Sepw1 MRE1 but not MRE2 oligonucleotide was observed in EMSA with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse ( Figure 2d ) .
As a control , no <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to MRE1 was detected with extract from a pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre mouse , confirming that the bandshift was indeed dependent on the presence of MTF-1 .
<termsem="GO:0046686"> Cadmium response </term> of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Ndrg1 was significantly <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in microarrays of liver transcripts from cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to similarly treated Mtf1loxP control mice ( Table 1 , c ) .
Ndrg1 probably has some role in <termsem="GO:0006950"> stress response </term> since various stimuli , including hypoxia and nickel compounds , activate <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of rodent Ndrg1 and/or its human ortholog ( 37 -- 40 ) .
The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCRs ( Figure 3a ) : for Mtf1loxP control livers , a clear increase of Ndrg1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was observed after cadmium exposure ; in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , this <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium response </term> was not detectable , while basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was similar to controls .
This indicates that cadmium-induced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Five MRE core consensus sequences are located upstream of the mouse Ndrg1 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( Figure 3b ) .
Four of them are clustered ( MRE1 to MRE4 ,  138 to  332 bp ) , the fifth one is located farther upstream ( MRE5 ,  883 bp ) .
EMSA was performed to test whether MTF-1 is interacting with some or all of the four proximal MRE sequences ( Figure 3c ) .
Separate oligonucleotides were tested for MRE1 and MRE2 , whereas one oligonucleotide spanning both sequences was used for MRE3 and MRE4 ( MRE3 ,4 ) .
No complex was seen with MRE1 , but specific MTF-1 complexes were observed for both the MRE2 and MRE3 ,4 oligonucleotides with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP mouse .
As expected , no bandshift was observed with protein extract from a mouse lacking MTF-1 ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) .
<termsem="GO:0046686"> Cadmium response </term> of Csrp1 depends on MTF-1 .
Csrp1 was found in microarray analyses to be significantly <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulated </term> in cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to Mtf1loxP mice ( Table 1 , c ) .
CSRP1 is a member of the evolutionary conserved CRP family of proteins that have been implicated in <termsem="GO:0007517"> myogenesis </term> and cytoskeletal remodeling ( 41,42 ) .
Semiquantitative <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCRs confirmed the microarray results , namely , that Csrp1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is elevated in Mtf1loxP livers upon cadmium exposure ( Figure 4a ) .
In contrast , no <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium response </term> was detectable in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , suggesting that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction of Csrp1 .
Three MRE core consensus sequences were found upstream of the Csrp1 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( MRE2 to MRE4 ,  56 to  366 bp ) , one was found immediately downstream ( MRE1 , +7 bp ; Figure 4b ) .
Specific <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> of MTF-1 was observed with EMSA for MRE2 oligonucleotide and protein extract from an Mtf1loxP liver , but not an Mtf1Mx-cre liver extract lacking MTF-1 , confirming the participation of MTF-1 in the complex ( Figure 4c ) .
MTF-1 inhibits <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Slc39a10 .
Slc39a10 was detected in microarray analysis to be significantly <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> in livers from both mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to control animals ( Table 1 , b and d ) .
SLC39 proteins are members of the Zrt - and Irt-like protein ( ZIP ) family of <termsem="GO:0046873"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metal ion transporters </term> </term> that <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> , with no known exception , metal ion substrates across cellular membranes into the cytoplasm ( 43,44 ) .
In accordance with microarray data , semiquantitative <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCRs showed a <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> of Slc39a10 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in livers of Mtf1loxP mice upon cadmium exposure .
In samples from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , the basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was significantly increased ; cadmium treatment still resulted in a decrease of Slc39a10 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 5a ) .
It can not be judged by this experiment whether the degree of cadmium-induced reduction of Slc39a10 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> was identical for Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice or lower in the absence of MTF-1 .
In microarray analysis , the degree of the <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> was either comparable to the one in control livers or lower , depending on the considered Affymetrix GeneChip  probe set ( data not shown ) .
The results indicate that MTF-1 is involved in <termsem="GO:0048519"> repression </term> of the basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Slc39a10 .
It might also participate in the <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium response </term> of this gene , but it is apparently not exclusively responsible .
One MRE core consensus sequence was found just upstream of the mouse Slc39a10 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( MRE1 ,  21 bp ) , another one directly downstream ( MRE2 , +17 bp ; Figure 5b ) .
Specific <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> of MTF-1 was observed in EMSA analysis for MRE2 with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP but not from an Mtf1Mx-cre mouse , while no <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> was detected with MRE1 ( Figure 5c ) .
<termsem="GO:0046686"> Cadmium-responsive </term> , MTF-1-independent genes .
Finally , we also identified a number of <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium-responsive </term> genes that were independent of MTF-1 presence , by comparing the probe array data of all cadmium-treated mice with the data of all mock-treated mice , irrespective of the genotype ( Table 2 ) .
An at least 2-fold , reliable <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> was observed after cadmium exposure for 31 probe sets corresponding to 21 different characterized genes ( Table 2 , a ) .
For 2 probe sets corresponding to 2 characterized genes , an at least 2-fold <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> was detected ( Table 2 , b ) .
Several genes involved in the metabolism of the <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> glutathione were found to be <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> by cadmium exposure , namely the genes encoding the catalytic subunit of <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutamate-cysteine ligase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Gclc </term> </term> ) that is the rate limiting enzyme in de novo <termsem="GO:0006750"> synthesis of glutathione </term> ( 45 ) ; <termsem="GO:0004362"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutathione reductase </term> </term> 1 ( <termsem="GO:0004362"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Gsr </term> </term> ) , the reducing enzyme for oxidized glutathione ( 45 ) ; and <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutathione-S-transferase </term> </term> , mu 4 ( Gstm4 ) , which is a member of the <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutathione-S-transferase </term> </term> supergene family of detoxification enzymes ( 45 ) .
In all of these cases , induction was confirmed by semiquantitative <termsem="GO:0006410"> RT </term> -- PCRs ( data not shown ) .
<termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Gclc </term> </term> , also referred to as heavy chain subunit of <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Ggcs </term> </term> - hc ) , had been discussed previously as a target gene of MTF-1 ( 6 ) .
Our <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> data indicate that <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Gclc </term> </term> is induced by cadmium but , at least in the adult mouse liver , not dependent on MTF-1 .
To analyze the role of the glutathione system in the cellular <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium response </term> , mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without functional Mtf1 were treated with cadmium in combination with BSO , a specific inhibitor of <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutamate-cysteine ligase </term> </term> ( 31 ) , and cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium salt MTT ( Figure 6 ) .
Increasing concentrations of BSO or cadmium alone were to some extent cytotoxic for the examined cell lines .
Treatment with both BSO and cadmium resulted in an enhanced lethality particularly for the cells without functional Mtf1 , indicating that a depletion of glutathione together with a lack of Mtf1 impair an efficient anti-cadmium <termsem="GO:0006952"> defense </term> .
Thus , adequate glutathione supply as well as MTF-1 and its target genes are essential for the survival of the cell under cadmium stress .
Besides genes related to the <termsem="GO:0006749"> glutathione pathway </term> , several other stress-related genes were <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulated </term> upon cadmium exposure , including genes for <termsem="GO:0004791"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> thioredoxin reductase </term> </term> 1 ( Txnrd1 ) , one of the reducing enzymes of the <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> thioredoxin ( 46 ) ; KDEL <termsem="GO:0006621"> endoplasmic reticulum protein retention </term> <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> 2 ( Kdelr2 ) participating in ER <termsem="GO:0006950"> stress response </term> ( 47 ) ; and the <termsem="GO:0006916"> anti- <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptotic </term> </term> Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 ( Bag3 ) involved in stress-induced <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> ( 48 ) .
In this study , a virtually complete deletion of Mtf1 in the liver of adult , pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre mice did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective mice under non-stress conditions , confirming that MTF-1 is dispensable in the adult liver ( 26 ) , in contrast to its essential role in embryonic <termsem="GO:0001889"> liver development </term> ( 23 ) .
The comparison of <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in livers of mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice revealed several MTF-1 target gene candidates .
Transcripts of the two <termsem="GO:0006950"> stress-responsive </term> metallothionein genes Mt1 and Mt2 were severely reduced , in support of a crucial role of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of metallothioneins ( 4,6 ) .
One of the newly found target genes is Sepw1 .
The exact molecular function of SEPW1 protein is unknown to date , but a role as <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> has been proposed due to its ability to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> glutathione ( 35 ) .
In accordance with this , ectopic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of mouse Sepw1 renders cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide , and this resistance is dependent on it <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> glutathione ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , Amantana et al. ( 49 ) showed that expression of a reporter gene fused to a rat Sepw1 promoter fragment can be induced in rat glial cells by copper and zinc , but not cadmium .
This <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> was dependent on an overlapping-inverted MRE sequence located proximal to the rat Sepw1 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start ( 49 ) , even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF-1 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to that sequence ( 50 ) .
Our <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> studies strongly suggest that MTF-1 is important for the basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of mouse Sepw1 by <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to the corresponding overlapping-inverted MRE sequence .
Ndrg1 , another interesting MTF-1 target gene was named N-myc downstream <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> gene 1 following the discovery that the <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> N-myc <termsem="GO:0048519"> represses </term> the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of mouse Ndrg1 ( 51 ) .
<termsem="GO:0006350"> Transcription </term> of Ndrg1 and/or its human ortholog is induced by different physiological and cell stress conditions , such as androgens , nickel compounds , DNA damage and hypoxia ( 37 -- 40,52,53 ) .
In addition , the protein is overexpressed in human cancers of many tissues , such as lung , liver , brain , breast , kidney and skin ( 40 ) .
Although Ndrg1 and especially its human ortholog have been quite intensely studied , its function remains unclear ; however , the induction by stimuli like nickel and hypoxia suggests an involvement in the <termsem="GO:0033554"> cell stress response </term> .
Such a role is strongly endorsed by our finding that Ndrg1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> is also induced by cadmium , and that MTF-1 plays a crucial role in this induction .
In the case of Csrp1 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> analyses and <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA-binding </term> studies indicate that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction by <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> to an MRE upstream of the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start .
Studies with human , avian and chicken CSRP1 have shown that this protein is <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> at <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> plaques and in association with filamentous actin , and interacts with the <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> plaque protein zyxin , as well as the <termsem="GO:0051764"> actin-cross-linking </term> protein alpha-actinin ( 54 -- 57 ) .
The ability to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> these partners suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization ( 58 ) .
Exposure of cultured cells to cadmium causes a decrease in , and destruction of , cellular contact proteins and the actin cytoskeleton ( 59 ) .
In the proximal tubule cells of the rat kidney , a partial loss of actin and the <termsem="GO:0051017"> actin-bundling </term> protein villin is observed upon cadmium treatment , as well as the derangement and <termsem="GO:0007019"> depolymerization of microtubules </term> ( 60 ) .
Assuming that CSRP1 is important for the organization of cytoskeletal elements in the mouse , its <termsem="GO:0045815"> upregulation </term> by cadmium might protect the organism from damage of the cytoskeleton .
Such a mechanism would expand the role of MTF-1 in <termsem="GO:0006950"> stress response </term> .
Our <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> studies also suggest that MTF-1 <termsem="GO:0048519"> represses </term> basal <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as activator for the expression of other target genes like Mt1 , Mt2 , and Znt1 ( 4,19 ) .
SLC39A10 is one of 14 mouse SLC39 members , which belong to the ZIP family of <termsem="GO:0046873"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> metal ion transporters </term> </term> ( 43,44 ) .
All members of the ZIP family characterized so far increase intracellular cytoplasmic metal ion concentrations by <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> extracellular and vesicular <termsem="GO:0006811"> ion transport </term> into the cytoplasm .
ZIP proteins have been reported to be <termsem="GO:0005385"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transporters of zinc </term> </term> , iron , manganese and/or cadmium ( 44,61 -- 63 ) .
Although SLC39A10 is largely uncharacterized ( 44 ) , it is referred to in several databases as putative <termsem="GO:0005385"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> zinc transporter </term> </term> .
It has been previously shown that MTF-1 is important for both basal expression and metal induction of the mouse Znt1 gene ( 19 ) .
ZnT proteins represent a different family of <termsem="GO:0005215"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transporters </term> </term> that reduce intracellular cytoplasmic zinc by <termsem="GO:0048518"> promoting </term> zinc efflux from cells or into intracellular vesicles .
Thus , members of the ZnT and ZIP family with zinc as predominant substrate have opposite roles in <termsem="GO:0006882"> cellular zinc homeostasis </term> ( 43 ) .
Assuming that SLC39A10 is indeed a <termsem="GO:0005385"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> zinc transporter </term> </term> , MTF-1 would <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of two <termsem="GO:0005385"> zinc transporters </term> with antagonistic functions , namely , Znt1 and Slc39a10 .
Specific <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> of MTF-1 was observed for an MRE located just downstream of the Slc39a10 <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start .
In a simple model , such a <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> could interfere with the accessibility of the <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> start </term> site for RNA polymerase II and/or general <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , thus preventing <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> initiation </term> of the gene .
Indeed , such a mechanism has been described in yeast for the <termsem="GO:0042156"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0010043"> zinc-responsive </term> activator </term> </term> protein 1 ( Zap1 ) and its target gene , zinc - <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> <termsem="GO:0005215"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transporter </term> </term> 2 ( ZRT2 ) ( 64 ) .
However , the inhibition of Slc39a10 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> by MTF-1 may well be more complex than a competition for promoter <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> .
Independent of MTF-1 , cadmium treatment also leads to <termsem="GO:0045814"> downregulation </term> of Slc39a10 transcripts , suggesting that some other factor is mediating this <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> .
A previous target gene search for MTF-1 with mouse embryos of conventional Mtf1 knockout phenotype revealed , besides metallothionein genes , the multifunctional alpha-fetoprotein ( Afp ) and the liver-enriched <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> CCAAT/enhancer <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> protein alpha ( Cebpa ) as prime candidates ( 65 ) .
After an early onset during <termsem="GO:0001889"> hepatogenesis </term> , Afp <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressed </term> postnatally and replaced by albumin ( 66 ) .
Thus , our adult Mtf1Mx-cre mice lacking MTF-1 were not suitable to analyze Afp <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Cebpa is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the adult liver as well as in other tissues ( 67 ) , but the present microarray data revealed no significant <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> differences in livers from adult Mtf1loxP and Mtf1Mx-cre mice ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , MTF-1 may affect Cebpa <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> only during <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryonal development </term> , perhaps in combination with as yet unidentified factors .
The present study confirms and extends the role of MTF-1 as an important <termsem="GO:0006950"> stress response </term> regulator .
We have identified and preliminarily characterized four target genes of MTF-1 in the adult mouse liver : in the case of Sepw1 , MTF-1 is required to maintain basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , supporting a role of mouse MTF-1 in <termsem="GO:0006979"> oxidative stress response </term> .
In addition , MTF-1 contributes to the cadmium-induced <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Ndrg1 and Csrp1 .
Furthermore , MTF-1 helps to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repress </term> the basal <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as <termsem="GO:0016563"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> activator </term> </term> for genes like Mt1 , Mt2 or Znt1 .
Thus the same <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> apparently serves as an activator or repressor , depending on the target gene .
The comparison of liver <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> of cadmium - and mock-treated mice also revealed a number of genes that were <termsem="GO:0046686"> responsive to cadmium exposure </term> , independent of the presence or absence of MTF-1 .
Evidence suggests that the <termsem="GO:0009058"> production </term> of reactive oxygen species is a major effect of acute cadmium toxicity ( 68,69 ) , and exposure of cultured cells or animals to cadmium is associated with depletion of reduced glutathione , lipid peroxidation and DNA damage ( 70 -- 73 ) .
Oxidative stress and the subsequent restoration of <termsem="GO:0019725"> cellular homeostasis </term> have been shown to induce the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> encoding <termsem="GO:0006953"> acute-phase </term> proteins and <termsem="GO:0016209"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> antioxidant </term> </term> enzymes ( 74 ) .
In mammals , cadmium tends to accumulate in the kidney and liver as a cadmium-metallothionein complex that has an extremely slow turnover ( 75,76 ) .
Furthermore , metallothioneins provide protection against oxidative stress ( 1,17 ) .
In addition to metallothioneins , glutathione was postulated as a first line of <termsem="GO:0006952"> defense </term> against cadmium toxicity ( 77 ) .
Glutathione efficiently <termsem="GO:0005488"> complexes </term> cadmium ( 78 ) and scavenges free radicals and other reactive oxygen species directly , and indirectly via enzymatic reactions ( 45 ) .
In such reactions , glutathione is oxidized and has to be regenerated by <termsem="GO:0004362"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutathione reductase </term> </term> .
Also , <termsem="GO:0004364"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> glutathione-S-transferases </term> </term> mediate the conjugation of various electrophiles to glutathione .
The observed cadmium-induced <termsem="GO:0045815"> upregulation </term> of <termsem="GO:0004357"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Gclc </term> </term> , <termsem="GO:0004362"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Gsr </term> </term> and Gstm4 supports the importance of glutathione in the cellular <termsem="GO:0046686"> cadmium response </term> .
The enhanced sensitivity to cadmium toxicity that we found for mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon a combination of Mtf1 deletion and depletion of glutathione further corroborates the importance of MTF-1 and its target genes as well as reduced glutathione for an efficient anti-cadmium <termsem="GO:0006952"> defense </term> .
Our data provide strong evidence for at least two branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense , one via MTF-1 and its target genes , notably metallothioneins , the other via glutathione , with an apparent overlap in Sepw1 .
