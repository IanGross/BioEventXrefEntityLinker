A <termsem="GO:0050918"> Chemoattractant </term> Role for NT-3 in <termsem="GO:0019230"> Proprioceptive </term> <termsem="GO:0007411"> Axon Guidance </term> .
Neurotrophin-3 ( NT-3 ) is required for <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> neuron survival .
Deletion of the <termsem="GO:0043065"> proapoptotic </term> gene Bax in NT-3 knockout mice rescues these neurons and allows for examination of their axon <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> in the absence of NT-3 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
TrkC-positive peripheral and central axons from dorsal root ganglia follow proper trajectories and arrive in close proximity to their targets but fail to innervate them .
Peripherally , muscle spindles are absent and TrkC-positive axons do not enter their target muscles .
Centrally , <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons <termsem="GO:0001763"> branch </term> in ectopic regions of the spinal cord , even crossing the midline .
In vitro assays reveal <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattractant </term> effects of NT-3 on dorsal root ganglion axons .
Our results show that survival factor NT-3 acts as a short-distance <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> molecule for muscle <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> afferents as they approach their proper targets .
Neurotrophin-3 ( NT-3 ) is a key requirement for the <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> inputs to <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons ( Chen and Frank 1999 ; Chen et al. 2003 ) .
Mice deficient in NT-3 , its <termsem="GO:0019199"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> tyrosine kinase receptor </term> </term> , TrkC , or in TrkC-positive neuron-specific <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> Runx3 display severe ataxia associated with the absence of muscle spindles , and loss of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> neurons in dorsal root ganglia ( DRGs ) or their axons ( Ernfors et al. 1994 ; Klein et al. 1994 ; Tessarollo et al. 1994 ; Farias et al. 1996 ; Liebl et al. 1997 ; Inoue et al. 2002 ; Levanon et al. 2002 ) .
NT-3 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the ventral spinal cord , in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> limb buds , and in intrafusal bag fibers of muscle spindles later in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( Copray and Brouwer 1994 ; Farias et al. 1996 ; Tojo et al. 1996 ) .
When <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons contact <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> myotubes , they <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> muscle spindle <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> ring-like spiral nerve endings around them .
In the chicken embryo , limb ablations or anti-NT-3 antibody injections into limb buds lead to <termsem="GO:0012501"> elimination </term> of TrkC-positive neurons and decreased innervation of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons ( Oakley et al. 1995 , 1997 ) .
Is NT-3 only a chemotrophic survival factor for muscle <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> afferents , or does it have additional roles in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of the proprioceptors and the <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishment </term> of the monosynaptic <termsem="GO:0060004"> reflex </term> arc ?
Here we provide evidence that NT-3 acts as a <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> chemoattractant </term> </term> for <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons during the final phase of their <termsem="GO:0007411"> target-directed pathfinding </term> .
TrkC-Positive DRG Neurons Are Rescued in Bax/NT -3 Double Knockout Mice .
Mice lacking <termsem="GO:0043065"> proapoptotic </term> protein Bax allow for distinguishing survival effects of neurotrophins from other effects .
Bax-deficient <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> neurons no longer require neurotrophins for survival ( White et al. 1998 ; Patel et al. 2000 ) , thus they can be used to examine axonal effects .
We <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> NT-3 heterozygote and Bax knockout ( KO ) mice to obtain mice with double KO of both NT-3 and Bax genes , and examined <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axonal projections .
All NT-3 and double KOs <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> within 48 h after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( Tessarollo et al. 1994 ) .
We performed TrkA/TrkC double immunohistochemistry ( Huang et al. 1999 ) , enabling detection of both proteins in the same sample .
TrkC-positive cells ( Figure 1A ) and fibers ( Figure 1E ) were absent in NT-3 KOs at embryonic day ( E ) 15 .
Two subsets of DRG cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> either TrkA or TrkC were detected in double KOs , similar to wild-type ( WT ) or Bax KO animals .
Surprisingly , at postnatal day ( P ) 0 , a few cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> TrkC even in NT-3 KO animals in the Bax + / + genetic background , and some cells co - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> TrkA and TrkC , regardless of the genotype ( Figure 1B ) .
In order to quantify our results , we analyzed the ratio of TrkA and TrkC immunopositive cells from four different DRGs of animals of different genotypes .
At all ages studied , Bax/NT -3 double null DRGs had TrkA/TrkC ratios similar to those of Bax null DRGs , and higher than those of NT-3 null DRGs ( Figure 1D ) .
TrkC-positive neurons rescued by Bax deletion , however , failed to <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> properly , as evidenced by the lack of <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> molecular marker Parvalbumin ( PV ) ( Figure 1C ) .
NT-3 Is Necessary for Proper Innervation of <termsem="GO:0050879"> Motor </term> Neurons .
TrkA/TrkC-positive fibers in the spinal cord could be detected at E15 ( Figure 1E ) .
TrkA-positive fibers were restricted to and terminated in the dorsolateral spinal cord , whereas TrkC-positive fibers entered the cord dorsomedially , and descended into the ventral horns in WT ( Ozaki and Snider 1997 ) and Bax KO embryos .
There was no detectable TrkC <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in NT-3 KO spinal cord , indicating complete absence of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> fibers .
In double KO spinal cord , TrkC-positive fibers entered the dorsal spinal cord and descended medially in a manner similar to that seen in WT or Bax KO cases .
However , it was not possible to follow TrkC immunolabeled fibers all the way to their terminal zones in any of the cases .
Next we examined the central projections of DRG axons with the lipophilic tracer DiI at P0 .
In WT and Bax KO pups , <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents entered the dorsal spinal cord and followed a medial course towards the ventral horn .
They then turned laterally towards <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons in the lateral <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> column , where they <termsem="GO:0001763"> branched </term> and terminated ( Figure 2A ) .
DiI labeling was confined to dorsal spinal cord in NT-3 KOs ( Figure 2A ) , as reported earlier , consistent with a complete absence of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> innervation ( Ernfors et al. 1994 ; Tessarollo et al. 1994 ) .
In double KOs , <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents initially followed a trajectory similar to that of WT counterparts , but most of them failed to project all the way to the ventral cord and into the lateral <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> column .
Instead , they arborized near the ventral midline ; some crossed the midline and extended into the contralateral ventral cord ( Figure 2A and 2C ) .
In order to distinguish between a role for NT-3 in initiation of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron innervation and a role for maintenance , we repeated the DiI labeling at E17 .
Innervation patterns of E17 spinal cords ( Figure 3 ) were similar to those at P0 ( Figure 2 ) .
Dorsal horns of all genotypes were filled with DiI-labeled fibers corresponding to nerve <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> -- dependent <termsem="GO:0019233"> nociceptive </term> axons .
In WT and Bax KO embryos , <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> fibers extended towards ventral horn <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons ( Figure 3A and 3B ) , whereas the ventral horns of the NT-3 KO embryos were devoid of innervation ( Figure 3C ) .
In the Bax/NT -3 double KOs , DiI-labeled fibers entered the ventral spinal cord , but extended towards the midline instead of the ventral horn ( Figure 3D ) , in a pattern similar to that observed at P0 .
Our data point to a complete absence of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> innervation of the ventral horn of the Bax/NT -3 null spinal cord throughout the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> stages investigated .
As the <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons never reach <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron dendrites in the ventral horn ( Figure S1 ) , the stretch <termsem="GO:0060004"> reflex </term> arc circuit is not <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> .
The failure to initiate contact between <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons in the absence of NT-3 suggests a requirement for NT-3 for proper <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon targeting </term> in addition to a role in <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axon maintenance .
NT-3 Is Required for Proper Peripheral Innervation .
In order to study peripheral innervation in double KO animals , we investigated spindle <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in the gastrocnemius muscle .
Muscle spindles could be identified easily in P0 WT and Bax KO animals by their characteristic morphology ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
<termsem="GO:0019230"> Proprioceptive </term> fibers labeled with neurofilament-M ( NF-M ) antibody <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> ring-like spiral endings wrapped around intrafusal bag fibers labeled with S46 antibody , specific for slow <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> myosin heavy chain protein ( Miller et al. 1985 ) .
As reported earlier , there were no muscle spindles in NT-3 KO animals ( Ernfors et al. 1994 ) .
On the other hand , Bax KO animals had more spindles than WT , and spindles were in clusters similar to animals over - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> NT-3 in the muscle ( Wright et al. 1997 ) .
Although NT-3-dependent cells were rescued , no muscle spindles were detected in the limbs of double KOs ( Figure 4A and 4B ) .
Muscle spindles could be observed with TrkC antibody in WT and Bax KO animals , but not in NT-3 or double KOs ( Figure 4E ) .
In both NT-3 and double KO animals , NF-M-labeled fibers could be detected in muscles , thus the muscles of these animals were not completely devoid of nerve fibers .
Since there were no TrkC-positive fibers in these muscles , we think that these NF-M-labeled fibers correspond to <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> axons .
Absence of muscle spindles might be due to a failure in initiation of <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons , or a failure of <termsem="GO:0021700"> maturation </term> and maintenance in the absence of NT-3 .
To distinguish between these two possibilities , we investigated muscle spindle development at E15 and E17 with S46/NF-M immunostaining as well as DiI labeling .
No structures with the characteristic muscle spindle shape could be detected in any of the genotypes at E15 ( Figure S2 ) .
However , numerous <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> spindles could be identified at E17 in WT and Bax KOs , but not in NT-3 KO embryos ( Figure 4C ) .
Bax/NT -3 double null muscles were devoid of spindles ( Figure 4C ) , except for one spindle-like structure observed in one leg of an embryo ( Figure 4C , inset , denoted by the asterisk ) .
DiI labeling through the DRGs at E17 yielded similar results , with muscle spindles identified in parallel sections in WT and Bax null muscles ( Figure 4D ) , but not in NT-3 or double KO animals .
Although DiI-labeled fibers could be detected in double null muscles , they never <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> ring-like structures characteristic of muscle spindles .
We also examined TrkA/TrkC <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at P0 in the tibial nerve , which carries <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> fibers to the gastrocnemius muscle as well as the skin of the lower leg .
In NT-3 KOs , TrkA-positive axons could be seen in the tibial nerve but there were no TrkC-positive axons ; in contrast , TrkA - and TrkC-labeled axons are both present in WT , Bax KO , and double KO animals ( Figure 4F ) .
These results suggest that although <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons follow proper trajectories in distal peripheral nerves , they fail to innervate their target muscles in the absence of NT-3 .
NT-3 Is a <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> Chemoattractant </term> </term> for DRG Axons In Vitro .
To test the hypothesis that NT-3 acts as a <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> chemoattractant </term> </term> for <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons , we performed a series of in vitro assays .
<termsem="GO:0019230"> Proprioceptive </term> axons in mice enter the gray matter in the spinal cord and <termsem="GO:0032502"> advance </term> ventrally parallel to the midline by E13 and reach the <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons by E15 ( Ozaki and Snider 1994 ) .
We co-cultured collagen-embedded E13 WT DRG explants with NT-3-soaked sepharose beads ( n = 26 ) .
Control cultures were set up using bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) -- or phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) -- soaked beads ( n = 12 ) .
DRG axons began <termsem="GO:0048675"> extending </term> towards the <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> NT-3 source by the end of the first day and consistently displayed a strong <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattraction </term> by 3 d in vitro , whereas they did not show such preference for BSA-loaded control beads ( Figure 5A and 5B ) .
This <termsem="GO:0050918"> attraction </term> was not due to survival support of NT-3 because Bax null ganglia displayed the same <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattraction </term> ( Figure 5C ; n = 16 ) .
NT-3 may act through either TrkC , or the p75NTR .
We repeated the co-culture experiments with DRG explants derived from p75NTR KO mice ( n = 18 ) .
Axons of these ganglia also showed strong <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattraction </term> towards the NT-3 beads ( Figure 5D ) .
Finally , we used diffusible TrkC <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> to IgG constant regions ( TrkC-Fc ) added to the medium ( n = 6 ) to deplete soluble NT-3 from the collagen gels ( Figure 5E ) .
In the presence of TrkC-Fc the <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattraction </term> was completely blocked , demonstrating that the effect we see is specific for NT-3 .
In order to investigate the active range of our beads , we have repeated the cultures with WT E13 DRGs by placing the beads at increasing distances from the ganglia ( n = 4 each ) ( Figure 5F ) .
There was still preferred <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> towards the bead at 1,200 m , the longest distance studied , although the number of axons and the extent of <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> were not as robust .
Next , we set up E13 DRG spinal cord explant cultures using NT-3-loaded beads placed at the midline at mid-spinal cord level as an ectopic NT-3 source ( n = 15 ) .
Control cultures were set using PBS-loaded beads ( n = 6 ) .
DiI labeling through the DRGs revealed numerous fibers entering the spinal cord at ectopic regions and <termsem="GO:0040007"> growing </term> towards the NT-3 beads ( Figure 6A ) , surrounding the beads and <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> bundles around them ( Figure 6C -- 6E ) .
In control cultures , all labeled fibers were <termsem="GO:0065007"> directed </term> towards the dorsal spinal cord and terminated there , where they normally enter the gray matter at E13 ( Figure 6B ) .
No axons were observed around the PBS-loaded control beads ( Figure 6F ) .
Axons that normally enter the gray matter through dorsal spinal cord <termsem="GO:0040007"> grow </term> towards the midline when presented with a <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> NT-3 source , and new axon <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> towards the NT-3 bead is initiated from DRGs , entering the spinal cord at ectopic loci at lateral mid-spinal cord ( Figure 6G ) .
NT-3 is therefore capable of acting as a <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> chemoattractant </term> </term> for DRG axons .
Relatively few studies have implicated NT-3 as a <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattractant </term> agent for <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> axons .
Previously noted <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattractant action </term> of the embryonic mouse maxillary process on trigeminal ganglion neurons ( Lumsden and Davies 1986 ) is now attributed to NT-3 and brain-derived <termsem="GO:0048666"> neurotrophic </term> factor ( BDNF ) ( O'Connor et al. 1999 ) .
Recently , Tucker et al. ( 2001 ) showed that <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> axons in limb slice cultures preferentially <termsem="GO:0040007"> grow </term> towards neurotrophin-soaked beads instead of following their normal trajectories .
Conversely , beads soaked with neurotrophin function-blocking antibodies led to reduction of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> and <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> axon <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> towards the limb .
In transgenic mice , which over - <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> NT-3 under the nestin promoter in the central nervous system , the course of the <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents are altered and <termsem="GO:0065007"> directed </term> towards the regions with high levels of ectopic NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ) .
Ringstedt et al. considered the possibility that NT-3 may play a <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattractant </term> role during the innervation of ventral horns by <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents .
However , earlier findings of normal <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferent trajectories in chicken embryos despite injection of function-blocking NT-3 antibody into the spinal cord ( Oakley et al. 1995 ) led them to discount this possibility .
In that study , though , assays on the effectiveness of antibody perturbation on NT-3-dependent cell survival showed that effectiveness was significant ( approximately 90 % ) but not complete ( Oakley et al. 1995 ) .
Ringstedt et al. ( 1997 ) argue that while central <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons may still navigate properly in the absence of NT-3 , ectopic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of NT-3 disrupts their <termsem="GO:0007411"> targeting </term> .
Recently , another member of the neurotrophin family , BDNF , has been suggested to act as a <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> chemoattractant </term> </term> for <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons innervating ear ( Tessarollo et al. 2004 ) .
In a gene replacement strategy in which BDNF <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by the NT-3 promoter , vestibular axons rerouted towards ectopic sources of BDNF in the cochlea that normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> NT-3 and were not innervated by these axons .
Ectopic NT-3 supplied using osmotic pumps and adenovirus-mediated <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axon <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> during <termsem="GO:0031099"> regeneration </term> ( Zhang et al. 1998 , Bradbury et al. 1999 , Oudega et al. 1999 , Ramer et al. 2002 ) , and <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> axonal plasticity of corticospinal axons in injured adult spinal cord ( Zhou et al. 2003 ) , where the sprouting axons from the intact site cross the midline towards the NT-3 source on the lesion side of the spinal cord .
Our present results are in agreement with these observations , and provide further evidence that NT-3 acts as a <termsem="GO:0042056"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> chemoattractant </term> </term> for <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> afferents .
Previously , normal <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neuron innervation was rescued in NT-3 KO animals by over - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> NT-3 selectively in their muscles ( Wright et al. 1997 ) .
It appears that peripheral NT-3 alone is sufficient for rescuing <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> neurons in NT-3 KO animals and proper <termsem="GO:0007411"> axonal pathfinding </term> in the spinal cord .
However , it is unclear whether NT-3 is absent from the ventral spinal cords of these animals .
The possibility has been raised that <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons may retrogradely <termsem="GO:0006810"> transport </term> NT-3 in muscle to the spinal cord ( Chen and Frank 1999 ) .
Assays to determine whether any NT-3 is present in the ventral horns of these mice would be informative .
Recently , Patel et al. ( 2003 ) reported their observations on Bax/NT -3 double KO mice they <termsem="GO:0000003"> bred </term> .
Their results are significantly different from ours .
They see no <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents in the periphery of the double knockouts and note that central <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> afferents terminate in the intermediate spinal cord without extending ventrally .
Their observations are based on PV immunostaining and DiI labeling of the peripheral nerves .
We noted that PV immunolabeling is diminished in our Bax/NT -3 double KOs .
In various manipulations of the neurotrophins it has been noted that molecular markers for <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons such as PV or calcitonin gene-related peptide for nerve <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> -- <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> axons are compromised ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ; Patel et al. 2000 ) , thus PV immunostaining in Bax/NT -3 double KOs can not reveal the extent of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons in the periphery .
Seventy-three percent of retrogradely labeled gastrocnemius muscle afferents were reported to be <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> TrkC RNA in the adult rat DRG , although some of these ( about 10 % ) may represent cutaneous innervation ( McMahon et al. 1994 ) .
Presently , it is not clear whether TrkC protein is also <termsem="GO:0009058"> made </term> by cutaneous afferents and if so at what stage in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> this <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by cutaneous axons .
Based on the available evidence showing that all <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> neurons are <termsem="GO:0012501"> eliminated </term> in NT-3 or TrkC null mice , we think that TrkC staining in the tibial nerve mostly represents <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons in the vicinity of their peripheral target .
Altogether , our findings suggest a role for NT-3 in initiation of muscle innervation and spindle <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> by the <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) examined DiI-labeled central DRG axons in the spinal cord of three E17 and two P0 cases , and report that central <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons stop in the intermediate laminae , never entering the ventral cord .
We have examined nine Bax/NT -3 double KO cases , and often incomplete DiI labeling gives the impression that there are no axons reaching the ventral spinal cord .
We have also seen cases similar to theirs ( n = 4 ) , but at higher magnification these axons did not have terminal boutons and were not completely labeled .
However , with complete fills ( n = 5 ) , it was possible to trace these axons into the ventral midline and across to the contralateral side , and visualize terminal boutons at their tips ( see Figure 3C ) .
Previously , Arber et al. ( 2000 ) reported that members of the Ets family of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> , Er81 and Pea3 , are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> by DRG neurons as well as <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons and their target muscle fibers .
They found that in the spinal cord of Er81 KO mice , ventral projections of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons were mostly absent , and very few axons made it to the ventral cord .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) note that the phenotype they observed in their Bax/NT -3 double KO mice is quite similar to that of Er81 KO mice .
They provide evidence that NT-3 induces Er81 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in DRG explants in vitro .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) report that Er81 mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is diminished ( but not abolished ) in both NT-3 KO and Bax/NT -3 double KO mice , while their immunohistochemistry shows much less protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the double KO mice .
It is highly possible that a small but considerable number of DRG cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> the <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> Er81 and that their axons <termsem="GO:0040007"> grow </term> beyond the intermediate levels of the spinal cord in Bax/NT -3 double KO mice .
While the phenotype of Er81 KO mice is quite dramatic , and most <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons stop within the intermediate spinal cord , it is important to note that a few axons still find their way to the ventral spinal cord and <termsem="GO:0007411"> target </term> properly to the <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons ( Arber et al. 2000 ) .
Patel et al. ( 2003 ) also present observations from islet2DTA mice , which lack a significant portion of the <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons in the ventral cord .
In these mice PV immunostaining shows axons in the ventral horns .
Patel et al. argue that since <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons are absent in these mice , NT-3 <termsem="GO:0046903"> secreted </term> by them could not be a signal for <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons to enter the lateral <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> columns .
However , there is no evidence showing that NT-3 mRNA or protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the ventral spinal cord is exclusively from <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons , and there are no available data indicating that in islet2DTA mice , NT-3 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the ventral spinal cord is abolished ( Yang et al. 2001 ; Pun et al. 2002 ) .
Studies in embryonic mice reported NT-3 mRNA in the ventral horns of the spinal cord , but it is not definitive that both mRNA and protein are <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> solely by <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons .
In the adult spinal cord , while <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> high levels of NT-3 , other cells , including glia , also <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> it ( Zhou and Rush 1994 ; Dreyfus et al. 1999 ; Buck et al. 2000 ) .
Our present results , along with those from transgenic mice with NT-3 over - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in ectopic regions of the spinal cord ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ) , argue for a role of NT-3 in <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattractant </term> <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> of <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons in the spinal cord .
Finally , in culture assays , we see a strong <termsem="GO:0050918"> chemoattraction </term> of DRG neurons to <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> sources of NT-3 .
This <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> is seen in WT , Bax null and in p75 null DRG explants , and in the absence of any other neurotrophins or target-derived <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> molecules .
Furthermore , in vitro , <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axon <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> to NT-3 does not appear to be dose-dependent ( Ringstedt et al. 1997 ; Tucker et al. 2001 ) .
NT-3 is capable of <termsem="GO:0050918"> attracting </term> axons along distances of up to 1 mm in collagen gel matrix , covering the physiological range it needs to <termsem="GO:0050918"> attract </term> axons during <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Previous studies with exogenous or local applications of NT-3 to <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> primary <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons have indicated that this neurotrophin can <termsem="GO:0050918"> attract </term> and <termsem="GO:0031128"> induce </term> axonal <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> ( Ulupnar et al. 2000 ; zdinler and Erzurumlu 2001 , zdinler et al. 2004 ) .
Along the monosynaptic stretch <termsem="GO:0060004"> reflex pathway </term> , only Wnt-3 has been implicated as an axon arborization factor in the spinal cord ( Krylova et al. 2002 ) .
Another molecule , Slit2 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the midline and by <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons ( Wang et al. 1999 ) is capable of <termsem="GO:0031128"> inducing </term> axonal <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al. 2001 ; zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002 ) .
DRG neurons <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Robo <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> , which <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to Slits , and <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons are therefore capable of <termsem="GO:0050896"> responding </term> to Slit signals ( Wang et al. 1999 ) .
Slit2 does not cause repulsion of NT-3 - <termsem="GO:0050896"> responsive </term> DRG axons in vitro ( Nguyen Ba-Charvet et al. 2001 ) , but causes ectopic <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> and arborization of trigeminal axons in the brainstem ( zdinler and Erzurumlu 2002 ) .
Thus , Slit2 might also be involved in terminal <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> of <termsem="GO:0019230"> propioceptive </term> axons in the ventral cord and in the midline <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> observed in our double KOs .
Lack of PV <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in Bax/NT -3 KO mice suggests that PV <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> might be responsible for proper <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon targeting </term> and muscle spindle <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Presently we can not completely rule out this possibility .
However , no defects in <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon pathfinding </term> along the monosynaptic <termsem="GO:0060004"> reflex </term> arc or in muscle spindle <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> have been noted in PV KO mice , which <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> normally and show no apparent changes in their <termsem="GO:0007610"> behavior </term> or <termsem="GO:0050879"> physical activity </term> ( Schwaller et al. 1999 ) .
These observations suggest that <termsem="GO:0007411"> axonal targeting </term> defects in Bax/NT -3 double KO mice can not be simply due to lack of PV <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> cells .
Our present results suggest that NT-3 acts as a short-range <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> cue for <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> axons centrally and peripherally , as they navigate to their targets using other <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> cues .
In its absence , these axons terminate in inappropriate loci .
However , NT-3 may not be the only molecule that plays a role in <termsem="GO:0007411"> targeting </term> and terminal <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> of <termsem="GO:0007600"> sensory </term> axons in the ventral spinal cord .
NT-3 most likely acts cooperatively with other <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> molecules or by <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of yet to be identified <termsem="GO:0019230"> proprioceptive </term> neuron-specific <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptors </term> </term> / ligands for numerous <termsem="GO:0007411"> axon guidance </term> cues .
<termsem="GO:0000003"> Generation </term> of double KOs .
We crossed Bax KO females on a C57BL/6 background ( Jackson Laboratory , Bar Harbor , Maine , United States ) to NT-3 heterozygote males on a 129 Sv background to <termsem="GO:0000003"> generate </term> double heterozygote animals .
Progeny was genotyped with PCR , and animals heterozygous for both genes were <termsem="GO:0007618"> bred </term> to obtain the double KOs .
Primers used for the Bax locus were R661 , GTT GAC CAG AGT GGC GTA GG ; R662 , CCG CTT CCA TTG CTC AGC GG ; and R663 , GAG CTG ATC AGA ACC ATC ATG .
Primers used for the NT-3 locus were NT3A , CGT GGT GAG GTT CTA TTG GCT AC ; NT3B , CAG AGC ACC CTG CCC AAA GCA GAG ; NT3R , CCT TGA CAA TAC TGA ATG CC ; and NEOF , GGG AAC TTC CTG ACT AGG .
WT , Bax KO , and NT-3 KO littermates were used as controls .
A total of 11 Bax/NT -3 double KO mice were analyzed , of these nine were P0 pups .
The p75 colony on a 129 S1 background was received from Jackson Laboratory .
We used tail DNA to genotype animals using the primers IMR0013 , CTT GGG TGG AGA GGC TAT TC ; IMR0014 , AGG TGA GAT GAC AGG AGA TC ( generic <termsem="GO:0008910"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> neo </term> </term> primers ) ; IMR0710 , TGT TAC GTT CTC TGA CGT GGT GAG ; and IMR0711 , TCA GCC CAG GGT GTG CAC TC ( p75 locus ) .

TrkA/TrkC immunohistochemistry .
Frozen spinal cord sections ( 10 m thick ) were blocked and incubated in a cocktail of rabbit anti-TrkA and goat anti-TrkC antibodies ( gift of Dr. Reichardt ; Huang et al. 1999 ) , followed by a cocktail of CY3 <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> donkey anti-rabbit and FITC <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> donkey anti-goat antibodies ( Chemicon , Temecula , California , United States ) in the presence of 0.3 % TritonX-100 and 10 % normal donkey serum .
For PV immunohistochemistry , sections were reacted with monoclonal mouse anti-PV antibody ( Sigma , St. Louis , Missouri , United States ) , and developed by Vector fluorescein mouse on mouse kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , California , United States ) .
For quantification purposes , TrkA - and TrkC-labeled cells from four different DRGs of each genotype and age studied were counted , and ratios plotted .
Muscle spindle detection .
Gastrocnemius muscle was dissected out in P0 pups and sectioned longitudinally , or , in some cases , the whole leg at the level of gastrocnemius muscle with tibial nerve was sectioned in cross section .
Sections were incubated with monoclonal S46 antibody ( gift of Dr. Stockdale ) reactive to the spindle-specific slow-tonic myosin heavy chain isoform and developed by Vector mouse on mouse kit as described above , followed by rabbit anti-NF-M antibody ( Chemicon ) and CY3 <termsem="GO:0043412"> conjugated </term> goat anti-rabbit antibody ( Chemicon ) in a sequential double-labeling protocol .
In another method , DiI crystals were placed in DRGs of E17 embryos from different genotypes ( n = 2 ) , and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated and sectioned into 40-m-thick slices on a vibratome .
DiI labeling .
Spinal cords were dissected out with the DRGs attached , <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> root was cut to prevent backfilling of <termsem="GO:0050879"> motor </term> neurons , and crystals of 1,1  - dioctadecyl-3,3,3  ,3  - tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate ( DiI ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , Oregon , United States ) were inserted in DRGs .
Labeled spinal cords were incubated at 37 C for 8 d and sectioned on a vibrotome at 100 m .
Sections were observed under the fluorescent microscope and photographed , and images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop , inverted , and adjusted for brightness and contrast .
Photoconverted in 0.15 % DAB ( 3,3  - diaminobenzidine ; Sigma ) in 0.1 M Tris buffer ( pH 8.2 ) .
In vitro co-culture assay .
DRG explants were derived from Swiss Webster , Bax null , and p75 null mouse embryos ( E13 ) .
For collagen matrix assays , DRGs were dissected out under a stereomicroscope using tungsten needles .
Collagen matrix was prepared with 430 l of collagen ( 3 mg/ml dissolved in 0.1 M acetic acid , Sigma ) , 50 l of 10X DMEM medium , and 2.5 l of 0.8 M NaCa2 , and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 .
Individual ganglion explants were placed in 24-well plates and covered with freshly prepared collagen .
Sepharose beads with an average diameter of 150 m were used .
Beads were washed twice with PBS , air dried , and loaded with 10 , 20 , 50 , or 100 ng/l NT-3 ( Collaborative Research , Chemicon ) at 4 C overnight with constant shaking .
For negative control , beads were loaded with BSA ( 10 -- 100 ng/l ) or PBS .
Either a single neurotrophin-loaded bead or a single BSA ( or PBS ) -- loaded bead was implanted about 200 -- 1,200 m away from the ganglion explant .
Collagen-embedded cultures were then placed at 33 C for 15 min for the matrix to harden .
Serum-free culture medium was then added to each well .
In cultures with WT DRG and control beads , 10 % serum was added to ensure viability of the explants .
TrkC-Fc ( Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Tarrytown , New York , United States ) was added ( 20 g/ml ) into the culture medium .
Spinal cords with attached DRGs were dissected out from Swiss Webster mouse embryos at E13 , and sectioned into 300-m-thick slices .
Tissue slices were placed on Millicell Tissue Culture Inserts ( Millipore , Billrica , Massachusetts , United States ) .
NT-3-loaded ( n = 15 ) or PBS-loaded ( n = 6 ) sepharose beads were prepared as described above , and placed in the midline at mid-spinal cord level .
Inserts were placed in six-well plates with serum-free medium at the bottom of the wells , and kept at 33 C for 3 d in the presence of 5 % CO2 .
Cultures were then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , and small crystals of DiI were placed into the DRGs .
Samples were incubated in a 37 - C incubator , allowing the dye to diffuse , and photographed under a Nikon ( Tokyo , Japan ) inverted epifluoresence microscope .
