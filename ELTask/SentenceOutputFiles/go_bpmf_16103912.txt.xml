Fog2 Is Required for Normal Diaphragm and <termsem="GO:0030324"> Lung Development </term> in Mice and Humans .
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia and other congenital diaphragmatic defects are associated with significant mortality and morbidity in neonates ; however , the molecular basis of these <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> anomalies is unknown .
In an analysis of E18 .5 embryos derived from mice treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea , we identified a mutation that causes pulmonary hypoplasia and abnormal diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Fog2 ( Zfpm2 ) maps within the <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> interval carrying the N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation , and DNA sequencing of Fog2 identified a mutation in a <termsem="GO:0008380"> splice </term> donor site that <termsem="GO:0009058"> generates </term> an abnormal transcript encoding a truncated protein .
Human autopsy cases with diaphragmatic defect and pulmonary hypoplasia were evaluated for mutations in FOG2 .
Sequence analysis revealed a de novo mutation resulting in a premature <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codon in a child who <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> on the first day of life secondary to severe bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia and an abnormally <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularized </term> diaphragm .
Using a phenotype-driven approach , we have established that Fog2 is required for normal diaphragm and <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> , a role that has not been previously appreciated .
FOG2 is the first gene implicated in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic human congenital diaphragmatic defects , and its necessity for <termsem="GO:0030324"> pulmonary development </term> validates the hypothesis that neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia may also have primary <termsem="GO:0030324"> pulmonary developmental </term> abnormalities .
<termsem="GO:0007567"> Birth </term> defects involving the diaphragm are as common and as serious as genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis , yet the underlying causes of these defects are unknown .
Most babies <termsem="GO:0007567"> born </term> with diaphragmatic defects have very small lungs , and many <termsem="GO:0016265"> die </term> in the newborn period with severe breathing difficulties .
It is unknown whether the small lungs occur because these children have a diaphragmatic defect , or whether some patients might have a genetic abnormality that affects the development of both the lung and the diaphragm simultaneously .
In a screen of fetal mice carrying chemically induced genetic mutations , the authors found that a mutation in the gene Fog2 ( Friend of gata 2 ) , causes abnormal diaphragm <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> and small lungs .
The lungs have a primary <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormality that includes the specific loss of one lung lobe .
Based on this result , the authors studied children affected with diaphragmatic abnormalities , and identified one human baby with a serious mutation in the human gene FOG2 who <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> at five hours of life with severe breathing difficulties , a diaphragmatic defect , and small lungs .
The authors have established that Fog2 is necessary for both diaphragm and <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> in mice and in humans .
This is the first known cause of a nonsyndromic congenital diaphragmatic defect and establishes that some patients may have a primary <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormality of both the lung and the diaphragm .
Congenital diaphragmatic defects are a spectrum of relatively common <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> defects .
The Bochdalek or posterolateral hernias ( often referred to as congenital diaphragmatic hernia [ CDH ] ) occur in 1/3 ,000 live <termsem="GO:0007567"> births </term> [ 1 ] , and although these are the most common type of diaphragmatic defect presenting at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , diaphragmatic aplasia and diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> defects ( eventrations ) may have a similar clinical presentation .
Making specific anatomic distinctions among these types of defects can be difficult without direct gross ( intraoperative or postmortem ) examination .
Pulmonary hypoplasia associated with these diaphragmatic defects causes severe mortality and morbidity .
The pathogenesis and <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> relationship between diaphragmatic defects and pulmonary hypoplasia is not understood .
Although advances in the medical management of pulmonary hypoplasia may have decreased the mortality associated with CDH patients who survive to receive care at high-volume centers [ 2,3 ] , the population-based mortality has been reported to be as great as 62 % , and there are a large number of <termsem="GO:0016265"> deaths </term> prior to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> or to transfer to a tertiary care facility [ 4 ] .
As these patients commonly present with severe respiratory failure at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> , therapy has been centered around developing better methods to provide ventilatory support while not <termsem="GO:0032502"> producing </term> further lung injury .
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) is used in some centers to provide an extended period of cardiopulmonary bypass [ 5,6 ] , while other centers have success using other ventilatory support techniques [ 7 ] .
The morbidity in those who survive is high , and many patients survive with chronic respiratory insufficiency , <termsem="GO:0050890"> cognitive </term> and <termsem="GO:0050905"> neuromotor </term> deficits , and <termsem="GO:0007605"> hearing </term> loss as a result of necessary intensive interventions and associated structural and irreversible <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities [ 8 -- 11 ] .
To date , there have been no specific mutations found to be associated with nonsyndromic diaphragmatic defects and pulmonary hypoplasia in humans .
The heritability of these defects is unclear , as the high morbidity and mortality limit the collection of multigenerational families for analysis .
The genetic etiologies are likely to be complex and probably arise from different mutations in various parts of the molecular <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental pathways </term> required for diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
Indeed , there are numerous reports implicating different chromosomal abnormalities in the pathogenesis of CDH [ 12,13 ] .
Given the difficulty of studying <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> abnormalities in humans , it is of great potential utility to <termsem="GO:0000003"> develop </term> animal models of human <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> defects , as the specific genetic abnormalities found in animal models can then be investigated in human populations .
We screened mice treated with the chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ( ENU ) for lines with <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> defects that present in the perinatal period [ 14 ] .
From this screen , we identified a line of mice carrying a recessive mutation that results in primary pulmonary hypoplasia and abnormal diaphragmatic and <termsem="GO:0007507"> cardiac development </term> .
Positional cloning analysis identified Fog2 ( Zfpm2 ) as a likely candidate , and DNA sequencing revealed a mutation in a <termsem="GO:0008380"> splice </term> donor site that <termsem="GO:0009058"> generates </term> an abnormal transcript encoding a truncated protein .
This result suggested that we examine the orthologous gene in humans with similar <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> defects , and we report the finding of a de novo nonsense mutation in FOG2 in a patient who <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> with a diaphragmatic defect and severe pulmonary hypoplasia .
This is the first reported mutation associated with these abnormalities in a human .
We present additional data that provide direct evidence that pulmonary hypoplasia may be a primary component of this spectrum of disorders .
Identification of the little lung Mutation in Fog2 .
We screened third-generation progeny of ENU-mutagenized mice at embryonic day 18.5 ( E18 .5 ) for abnormal <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> phenotypes [ 14 ] .
One line of mice was found to have multiple embryos in independent litters that displayed pulmonary hypoplasia and a thin diaphragm .
The mutation , which we called little lung ( lil ) , was mapped to Chromosome 15 by utilizing a strategy of interval haplotype analysis ( data not shown ) [ 15 ] .
For high-resolution mapping , F2 progeny from two crosses were analyzed .
In 450 progeny of an intercross of F1 ( A/J  FVB/N ) lil / + mice , the interval containing the mutation was defined by 19 recombinants between D15Mit220 and D15Mit154 .
Because of the lack of informative markers within this interval , an additional 39 F2 progeny from an A/J  C57BL/6J cross were tested .
The identification of two recombinants established D15Mit85 as the proximal and D15Mit5 as the distal flanking markers .
The lil phenotype was identified at E18 .5 to have bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia and an abnormal diaphragm .
Pulmonary hypoplasia was apparent in all mutant mice that survived to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
In a comparison between wild-type and mutant mice found <termsem="GO:0016265"> dead </term> on day one of life , body weights were not different ; however , the lung weights were significantly lower in the mutant mice .
The average mutant lung weight was 9.6  2.5 mg while the average wild-type lung weight was 26.4  4.6 mg ( p < 0.001 ) .
All lungs from mutant mice were lacking an accessory lobe on the right side and had underdevelopment of the anterior right middle lobe ( Figure 1A ) .
Diaphragms from mutant lil mice were intact , but <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> was absent in the dorsal regions .
Myotubules were present in a limited and abnormal <termsem="GO:0051179"> distribution </term> .
More specifically , myotubules normally radiate in a mediolateral fashion to meet the lateral body walls , with a normal paucity of muscle fibers in the central tendonous region .
In the mutant diaphragm , myotubules radiated in a dorsal -- ventral orientation , and muscle tissue did not meet the entire surface of the body walls ( Figure 1B ) .
The number of lil mutant mice that survived to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> was less than 5 % of total progeny , rather than the 25 % expected for a recessive mutation .
We evaluated litters at different embryonic time points to determine whether the reduced number was due to intra-uterine <termsem="GO:0016265"> demise </term> .
Litters were collected at E12 .5 , 13.5 , 15.5 , 17.5 , and 18.5 , and embryos were genotyped and evaluated for evidence of intra-uterine <termsem="GO:0016265"> demise </term> , including <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> retardation , pallor , and tissue friability .
lil embryos had a progressively higher rate of <termsem="GO:0016265"> demise </term> between E13 .5 and E15 .5 .
At E12 .5 , 20 out of 87 ( 23 % ) were homozygous for the mutation , and all of these appeared viable .
At E13 .5 , 13 of 49 ( 27 % ) were mutant and two had <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> .
At E15 .5 , 22 out of 91 ( 24 % ) were mutant and the majority of mutant embryos ( 17 out of the 22 ) had <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> .
By E18 .5 , nine of 29 embryos ( 31 % ) were homozygous for the mutation , of which only one embryo was viable .
Diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> was abnormal in all mutant mice examined ( n > 25 ) .
Pulmonary hypoplasia was observed in 100 % of mutants evaluated for that phenotype between E11 .5 and <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> ( n > 50 ) .
Examination of cardiac morphology showed that hearts from E15 .5 lil mutant mice had a variety of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> defects , including enlarged and abnormally <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> endocardial cushions , a double-outlet right ventricle , and a complete atrioventricular canal .
The myocardium was also poorly <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> , with thinning of the outer compact layer and decreased vascularity .
The cohort of mutant mice that survived to <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> also had cardiac malformations including atrioventricular-canal-type ventricular septal defects , ostium primum atrial septal defects , and enlarged atria ( data not shown ) .
All mutants specifically evaluated for a cardiac phenotype ( n = 10 ) had abnormal <termsem="GO:0007507"> cardiac development </term> .
Examination of the 3-Mb region between D15Mit85 and D15Mit5 in DNA sequence databases revealed three predicted genes and four known genes , including Fog2 .
Targeted mutations of Fog2 have cardiac defects strikingly similar to those we identified in lil mutant mice , including atrioventricular canal defects , thinned myocardium , and absent coronary vasculature [ 16 ] .
<termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="GO:0006410"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> </term> - PCR amplification of the proximal portion of Fog2 revealed longer transcripts in the lil mutant than in the wild-type embryos ( Figure 2A ) .
Sequencing of the mutant transcript revealed a point mutation ( from thymine to cytosine ) 2 bp after position 301 , which is in the <termsem="GO:0008380"> splice </term> donor site at the end of the third exon .
This mutation causes a <termsem="GO:0008380"> splicing </term> defect that results in the insertion of 85 bp of intronic sequence into the mutant transcript , and introduces a <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codon that <termsem="GO:0009058"> generates </term> a severely truncated protein product ( Figure 2B ) .
Heterozygous lil mutant mice were crossed with a Fog2 + /  ( null allele ) mutant <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> by gene targeting [ 16 ] .
Doubly heterozygous mice had an embryonic <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> phenotype ; this failure to complement proves that lil is a mutation in Fog2 .
The variable phenotype of lil mice ( relative to that found for the Fog2 null mutant ) is likely due to the <termsem="GO:0009058"> generation </term> of a low level of normal transcript despite the presence of the <termsem="GO:0008380"> splice </term> site mutation .
Lung and Diaphragm Development in the Fog2 Mutant Mouse .
Experiments were conducted to evaluate the role of Fog2 in pulmonary and diaphragmatic development .
The pulmonary phenotype is characterized by diffuse hypoplasia and specific loss of the accessory lobe and a portion of the right middle lobe .
It is well established that abnormalities in either diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> or fetal breathing can result in a secondary pulmonary hypoplasia , although loss of normal structure has never been documented in this context [ 17,18 ] .
Fog2 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> diffusely in the pulmonary mesenchyme during the period of <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching morphogenesis </term> , while later <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is restricted to the smooth muscles of airways and pulmonary vessels ( Figure 3 ) .
This , and the observation that lungs appeared small on transverse sections evaluated prior to diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> or function , suggests that the pulmonary hypoplasia occurs independently of the diaphragmatic defect .
To test this hypothesis , lungs were dissected from Fog2  /  mice and littermate controls before the onset of fetal diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0050879"> motion </term> .
Fog2  /  mice were used for this experiment , as we wanted to avoid potential phenotypic variance from the lil hypomorphic mutation .
Lungs dissected at E12 from Fog2  /  embryos were smaller in size and lacked the <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of an accessory lobe .
In 11 viable Fog2  /  lung culture explants , there was never <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of an accessory lobe , and the weights of mutant lungs cultured for 5 d were significantly lower than those of littermate controls ( Figure 4 ) .
These data demonstrate that the pulmonary hypoplasia in Fog2 mutant mice is a primary defect .
<termsem="GO:0001763"> Branching </term> in the unaffected lobes appeared to be delayed by 6 -- 12 h , but all mutants <termsem="GO:0000003"> developed </term> an intricate <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> pattern in the unaffected lobes after culture for 5 d. Because the Fog2 phenotype is striking for specific lobar loss , the spatial pattern of Fog2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was evaluated in normal embryos during the period of early lobar <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishment </term> to determine whether Fog2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is specifically different at these lobar buds .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> was evaluated in mice carrying a lacZ gene incorporated into the Fog2 locus ( S. Tevosian , unpublished data ) .
In nine mice examined at E11 .5 , all lungs showed a specific <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhancement </term> of Fog2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the mesenchyme surrounding the accessory bud and the right middle lobe bud , which are the lobes that do not <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> normally in Fog2 mutant mice ( Figure 5 ) .
By E12 .5 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was diffuse in the pulmonary mesenchyme , as was seen previously with in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> on tissue sections .
Diaphragms from Fog2 lil mice show an intact membrane with a defect in muscular <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> ( see Figure 1B ) .
The membranous portion of the diaphragm is populated by a <termsem="GO:0016477"> migratory </term> population of muscle precursor cells , much like the limbs [ 19,20 ] .
Mice with defects in genes known to be important for the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of this process have intact but amuscular diaphragms [ 17,21,22 ] .
Hepatocyte <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> / Scatter factor ( HGF ) is one potential candidate responsible for the guidance of muscle precursors to the membranous diaphragm .
It has been shown that HGF is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> along this anatomic pathway [ 23 ] , and mice with absence of the <termsem="GO:0005008"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> HGF receptor </term> </term> c-Met fail to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularized </term> pleuroperitoneal folds ( PPFs ) , and thus have amuscular diaphragms [ 24,25 ] .
Fog2 is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> diffusely in the early amuscular diaphragm at E11 .5 as well as in the later <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularized </term> diaphragm ( see Figure 3C and 3D ) .
Pax3 and MyoD , <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> required for appropriate <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration </term> and <termsem="GO:0007521"> determination of <termsem="GO:0007517"> myogenic </term> precursors </term> , were detected in the PPFs of Fog2 lil mice ( data not shown ) .
However , in situ <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> analysis demonstrated that the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of HGF in the region where this structure meets the membranous diaphragm was markedly reduced in Fog2 mutant mice ( Figure 6 ) .
We hypothesize that Fog2 is required ( either directly or indirectly ) for the induction of HGF in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> diaphragm , and dysregulation of HGF patterning along the path of muscle precursor <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> between the PPF and the diaphragm accounts for the abnormal phenotype in these mice .
FOG2 Mutation in a Patient with Diaphragm and Lung Abnormalities .
FOG2 sequence analysis was performed on autopsy tissue from 30 of 32 <termsem="GO:0016265"> deceased </term> children with an anatomic diagnosis of diaphragmatic defect evaluated at the Children 's Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , between 1993 and 2003 .
Autopsy reports were reviewed to determine the specific diagnoses .
Of these 30 cases , 17 ( 57 % ) had Bochdalek CDH , two ( 7 % ) had diaphragmatic agenesis , seven ( 23 % ) had diaphragmatic eventration / <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> defects ( without Bochdalek CDH ) , and four ( 13 % ) had Bochdalek hernia of one hemidiaphragm and eventration of the other .
Pulmonary hypoplasia was assessed using lung/body weight ratio and radial alveolar counts [ 26 ] .
The material available for review included written reports and histologic slides in all cases and gross kodachromes in a subset of cases .
One child carried a highly significant FOG2 sequence change .
The patient was a full-term 3,500-g baby girl who developed severe respiratory failure at <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> and <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> after 5 h of resuscitation .
Antemortem radiographs showed opacified lung fields and possible bowel in the chest .
The patient 's clinical diagnosis was CDH .
Review of autopsy material revealed severe bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia ( combined lung weight , 11.1 g ; expected for body length/weight , 46.8  26.2 g ; [ 27 ] ) , most markedly involving the left lung .
The lung/body weight ratio was 0.0037 ( expected > 0.010 ) [ 28 ] .
There were a reduced number of bronchial generations , and the radial alveolar count was 2 -- 3 ( expected = 5 ) [ 29 ] .
There were incomplete lung fissures bilaterally .
A deep posterior diaphragmatic eventration was present on the left side .
Additionally , two <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularized </term> ligamentous bands resembling diaphragmatic remnants encircled the left lobe of the liver , <termsem="GO:0032502"> creating </term> an abnormal fissured liver contour .
Away from the eventration , the diaphragm appeared well <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularized </term> , measuring 0.3 cm in thickness .
A complete autopsy revealed no other malformations ; the heart was determined to be grossly normal and was donated for valve harvest .
Sequence analysis revealed a cytosine to thymine heterozygous change in exon 4 that changes the 112th amino acid from arginine to a <termsem="GO:0006353"> <termsem="GO:0006415"> stop </term> </term> codon .
This mutation <termsem="GO:0009058"> produces </term> a severely truncated peptide that does not contain zinc finger domains ( Figure 7 ) .
This base change was not present in the analysis of DNA from 400 normal adults .
To assess the likelihood that the mutation was causal for the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> phenotype , we examined both parents .
Paternity was confirmed , and sequence analysis revealed that the neither parent carried this mutation , proving that the patient had a de novo mutation in FOG2 ( Figure 7 ) .
Congenital diaphragmatic defects are a heterogeneous group of disorders of unknown etiology .
The defects that present in the pre - or perinatal period include Bochdalek hernia , diaphragmatic aplasia , and various degrees of <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> defects or eventrations .
Different types of defects occur in the same patients or in siblings , suggesting these represent variable expression of the same underlying pathogenesis [ 30,31 ] .
Clinical differentiation between these defects may be very difficult , as the residual membranous diaphragm of a <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> defect is thin and may not be easily visible on prenatal ultrasound or postnatal chest radiographs [ 32 ] .
Although diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> defects were historically considered to be predictive of a good outcome , there have been inadequate population-based studies that include fetal or neonatal cases and autopsy diagnoses to make this conclusion definitive .
In fact , the series of patients we report here and the published literature indicate that an eventration defect may be associated with displacement of abdominal contents and also with severe pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory insufficiency [ 33,34 ] .
Numerous chromosome abnormalities have been found in association with congenital diaphragm abnormalities [ 12,35 ] .
Human FOG2 maps to Chromosome 8q23 .1 , and , importantly , several patients with diaphragm defects and rearrangements involving this locus have been reported .
Specifically , there are three unrelated CDH patients with cytogenetically balanced translocations at or near the FOG2 locus [ 36,37 ] .
Additionally , two patients with deletions apparently encompassing the FOG2 locus have <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> from multiple congenital anomalies including CDH [ 38 -- 40 ] .
Inactivation of this gene due to chromosomal rearrangement or deletion would result in a heterozygous null mutation similar to that found in the patient we report .
Because the FOG2 mutation we report is de novo and the phenotypes of the pulmonary and diaphragmatic defects are similar between mouse and human , we suggest that this mutation in FOG2 is the first reported cause of a human <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> diaphragmatic and pulmonary defect .
In contrast to the affected child , mice heterozygous for a null mutation of Fog2 appear normal .
However , there is ample precedent for the observation that haploinsufficiency of a gene with <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> functions is much less well tolerated in humans than mice [ 41 ] .
It is unclear how the Fog2 diaphragmatic defect relates to the more common Bochdalek CDH , as the pathogenic mechanisms for both are largely unknown .
Muscle precursors destined to populate the diaphragm <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> from the lateral dermomyotome of cervical somites .
Prior to <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration </term> onto the diaphragm , they populate the PPF , a wedge-shaped tissue that tapers medially from the lateral body wall to the esophageal mesentery and fuses ventrally with the septum transversum [ 42 ] .
Muscle precursors reach the PPF by E11 , where they <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferate </term> , <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiate </term> , and then <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> toward the dorsolateral costal , sternal costal , and crural regions of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> diaphragm .
Thus , a defect in PPF <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> subsequently results in the abnormal <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> of the diaphragm [ 43 ] .
We have shown that the Fog2 mutant does have an abnormal pattern of HGF <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the region through which muscle precursor cells <termsem="GO:0016477"> migrate </term> onto the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> diaphragm .
This finding may account for the abnormally <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterned </term> muscle that <termsem="GO:0032502"> develops </term> in the Fog2 mutant diaphragm .
Although Pax3 and MyoD <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is detected in the PPF , a detailed analysis of <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> responsible for muscle precursor <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> and differentiation will need to be completed both in the PPF and along the pathway of muscle precursor <termsem="GO:0016477"> cell migration </term> between the PPF and the membranous diaphragm .
Fog2 can interact with any of the Gata factors , Gatas 1 -- 6 , as well as other <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> such as CoupTFII [ 44,45 ] .
It is known that a Fog2 -- Gata4 interaction is critical for normal cardiac and <termsem="GO:0008406"> gonadal development </term> , but interacting factors in the lung and diaphragm have not yet been determined .
The severity of pulmonary hypoplasia in the patient we report was out of proportion to that of the diaphragm defect .
Pulmonary hypoplasia is associated with abnormal diaphragmatic anatomy or function , and is known to occur as a secondary <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> defect in models of diaphragmatic dysfunction such as complete amuscularization [ 17 ] or phrenic nerve disruption [ 46 ] .
It occurs in a surgical model of CDH in which a hernia is physically <termsem="GO:0032502"> created </term> in an in utero lamb [ 47,48 ] .
However , the possibility that primary <termsem="GO:0030324"> pulmonary developmental </term> abnormalities occur with , rather than secondary to , diaphragmatic defects has been suggested by others based on a teratogenic model of CDH [ 49 -- 51 ] and has long been suspected by clinicians who care for these patients .
In addition , the high incidence of lobar abnormalities associated with CDH [ 52 ] supports the possibility that this disorder can be associated with a primary <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> pulmonary abnormality .
Our analysis of mice carrying mutations of Fog2 proves that there is a primary defect in <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> that results in specific loss of the accessory lobe and partial loss of the right middle lobe .
The specific lobar defects prompted us to evaluate Fog2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at the time of early lobar budding .
While Fog2 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is diffuse in the pulmonary mesenchyme after lobar structure is well <termsem="GO:0032502"> established </term> ( E12 .5 ) , it is more focally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the mesenchyme surrounding the right middle lobe and accessory buds as these lobes <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> .
This matches the phenotype of right middle lobe and accessory lobe loss , and suggests that Fog2 has a specific <termsem="GO:0007389"> patterning </term> role in <termsem="GO:0032502"> establishment </term> of these lobes .
It is less clear whether loss of Fog2 results in a global <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> defect , as Fog2 lungs appear to have a slight <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental </term> delay , which could result from many causes .
Cultured Fog2 lungs do <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> an intricate <termsem="GO:0001763"> branching </term> pattern in the unaffected lobes that appears similar in the pattern to wild-type lungs after 5 d in culture .
In this report , we show that a mutation of Fog2 in the mouse causes the phenotype of abnormal diaphragmatic <termsem="GO:0007517"> muscularization </term> and primary pulmonary hypoplasia .
We furthermore demonstrate that a mutation in this gene is associated with a <termsem="GO:0016265"> lethal </term> defect in lung and diaphragm development in a child .
It is notable that , despite extensive analysis of Fog2 biology and the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of a Fog2 knock-out mouse , its role in diaphragm and <termsem="GO:0030324"> lung development </term> was previously not recognized .
It is only as a consequence of phenotype-driven analyses such as those we are pursuing that one has the opportunity to assay all of the potential molecular derangements that may result in human disease .
