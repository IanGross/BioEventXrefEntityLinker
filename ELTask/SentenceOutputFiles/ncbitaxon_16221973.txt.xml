Two major branches of anti-cadmium defense in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> : MTF-1 / metallothioneins and glutathione .
Metal-responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF-1 ) regulates expression of its target genes in response to various stress conditions , notably heavy metal load , via binding to metal response elements ( MREs ) in the respective enhancer/promoter regions .
Furthermore , it serves a vital function in embryonic liver development .
However , targeted deletion of Mtf1 in the liver after birth is no longer lethal .
For this study , Mtf1 conditional knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and control littermates were both mock - or cadmium-treated and liver-specific transcription was analyzed .
Besides the well-characterized metallothionein genes , several new MTF-1 target genes with MRE motifs in the promoter region emerged .
MTF-1 is required for the basal expression of selenoprotein W , muscle 1 gene ( Sepw1 ) that encodes a glutathione-binding and putative antioxidant protein , supporting a role of MTF-1 in the oxidative stress response .
Furthermore , MTF-1 mediates the cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 ( Ndrg1 ) , which is induced by several stress conditions and is overexpressed in many cancers .
MTF-1 is also involved in the cadmium response of cysteine - and glycine-rich protein 1 gene ( Csrp1 ) , which is implicated in cytoskeletal organization .
In contrast , MTF-1 represses the basal expression of Slc39a10 , a putative zinc transporter .
In a pathway independent of MTF-1 , cadmium also induced the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis and regeneration of glutathione , a cadmium-binding antioxidant .
These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense , one via MTF-1 and its target genes , notably metallothioneins , the other via glutathione , with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W. All <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organisms </term> have evolved mechanisms to cope with a variety of stress situations .
One type of stress response is triggered by heavy metals , such as zinc , copper and cadmium ( for convenience , the terms zinc , copper and cadmium are also used here to denote Zn2 + , Cu2 + and Cd2 + , respectively ) .
Metallothioneins ( MTs ) , small , cysteine-rich proteins , play an important role in metal homeostasis and detoxification due to their ability to bind different heavy metal ions ( 1 -- 3 ) .
In the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , there are four metallothionein genes , designated as Mt1 to Mt4 .
Basal , as well as heavy metal-induced , expression of Mt1 and Mt2 is mediated by metal-responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF-1 ) ( 4 -- 7 ) .
This zinc finger protein recognizes short cis-acting DNA sequences , termed metal response elements ( MREs ; core consensus sequence TGCRCNC ) , which are present in the promoters of target genes ( 8,9 ) .
MTF-1 is conserved in evolution , and homologs have been characterized in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> ( 10 ) , <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> humans </term> ( 11 ) , <termsem="NCBITaxon:7215"> <termsem="taxonomic_rank"> Drosophila </term> </term> ( 12 -- 14 ) and <termsem="NCBITaxon:7898"> fish </term> ( 15,16 ) .
The role of MTF-1 has been studied most extensively in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> .
Besides coping with heavy metal load , MTF-1 can also mediate the induction of Mt genes in response to other stress situations , such as oxidative stress ( 5,17 ) and hypoxia ( 18 ) .
In addition , it is required for the metalloregulation of Znt1 , encoding the major plasma membrane-localized zinc efflux transporter ( 19 ) , the hypoxic/anoxic induction of the gene for placental growth factor ( Plgf ) , an angiogenic protein of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family ( 20 ) , and has recently been invoked in tumor development ( 21,22 ) .
Furthermore , MTF-1 has an essential function during embryogenesis : targeted disruption of Mtf1 results in embryonic lethality around 14 days post coitum due to hepatocyte necrosis ( 23 ) .
In contrast , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> with null mutations for the stress-inducible metallothionein genes ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) are viable , though sensitive to cadmium ( 24,25 ) , indicating that additional important MTF-1 target genes are involved in the lethal phenotype .
With the Cre-loxP conditional knockout technique , it is possible to circumvent the embryonic lethal phenotype of conventional Mtf1 knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> .
Previous experiments with this technique revealed that deletion of Mtf1 from the liver after birth is no longer lethal under non-stress conditions ( 26 ) .
For this study , an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> line was generated to perform a search for MTF-1 target genes and cadmium-inducible genes in the adult liver .
A number of target gene candidates emerged upon a transcriptome analysis of mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1 conditional knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and control littermates and several of these were confirmed by semiquantitative RT -- PCR .
Besides the stress-inducible metallothionein genes that were already known as target genes of MTF-1 , we find that MTF-1 is important for basal liver expression of the gene for selenoprotein W , muscle 1 ( Sepw1 ) as well as for cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 ( Ndrg1 ) and the gene encoding cysteine - and glycine-rich protein 1 ( Csrp1 ) .
In addition , MTF-1 appears to repress the expression of solute carrier family 39 , member 10 gene ( Slc39a10 ) , which encodes a putative metal ion transporter .
In an MTF-1-independent transcriptome response , several genes involved in glutathione metabolism are induced .
Further studies confirmed a dual anti-cadmium defense , one via glutathione and another one via MTF-1 and its target genes , including metallothioneins .
Generation of Mtf1 conditional knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> and liver-specific deletion .
Mtf1 conditional knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were generated in collaboration with Dr Michael Leviten ( San Carlos , CA ) .
Two genomic clones containing exons 3 to 6 of Mtf1 were used to construct a gene targeting vector for homologous recombination ( Supplementary Data ) .
A neomycin resistance cassette ( PGK-neo ) flanked by two loxP sites was cloned into the SacI site 5  of exon 3 of Mtf1 , the third loxP site was cloned into the ScaI site 3  of exon 4 .
A thymidine kinase ( TK ) cassette was inserted in the HpaI site 3  of exon 6 .
129 ES cells were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector , selected in the presence of G418 and FIAU , and screened for correct integration events by PCR and Southern blot analysis .
Transient expression of Cre recombinase led to removal of the PGK-neo cassette , and <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> carrying the modified Mtf1loxP allele were generated by injection of positive clones into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and subsequent crosses .
Homozygous conditional knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> ( Mtf1loxP/loxP ) were crossed with the Cre recombinase transgenic line Mx-cre ( a gift from Prof. Michel Aguet ) to obtain an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout line .
The <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were genotyped by PCR using the following primers ( Microsynth ) : Cre recombinase : 5  - CTATCCAGCAACATTTGGGCCAGC-3  ; 5  - CCAGGTTACGGATATAGTTCATGAC-3  , Mtf1loxP or wild-type allele : 5  - CACACCCAGTTTGTGTATGTCTTC-3  ; 5  - CAGTCACAAGCAAATTACCAAACACTGCC-3  .
At 8 weeks of age , male Mtf1loxP/loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> harboring the Mx-cre transgene ( Mtf1loxP/loxP Mx-cre , abbr. : Mtf1Mx-cre ) and control littermates without transgene ( Mtf1loxP/loxP , abbr. : Mtf1loxP ) received four intraperitoneal injections each of 300 g synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic -- polycytidylic acid [ pI -- pC ; Sigma ; in a volume of 60 l phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ] at 3 day intervals .
Only in the case of DNA-binding studies with MRE sequences from MTF-1 target gene candidates , the control <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> received no pI -- pC injections .
For experiments with metal treatment , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> received 2 days after the last pI -- pC treatment a subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection of either 20 mol/kg body weight CdSO4 ( 2 mM CdSO4 in H2O ; cadmium treatment ) or 10 ml/kg body weight H2O ( mock treatment ) 6 h before sacrificing them .
Microarray analysis and data processing .
Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment ; all male ) essentially as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi ( 27 ) .
Gene expression analysis was performed in the Functional Genomics Center Zurich using GeneChip  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mouse </term> Genome 430 2.0 Arrays ( Affymetrix ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions and the following reagents and conditions .
cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript  Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Invitrogen ) , using 15 g total RNA .
In vitro transcription was performed with BioArray  High Yield  RNA Transcript Labeling Kit ( Enzo ) and 3.5 to 6 g of each cDNA .
Clean-up of both cDNA and cRNA samples was done using GeneChip  Sample Clean-up Module ( Affymetrix ) .
For the automated washing and staining in the Affymetrix fluidics station 450 , the protocol EukGE-Ws2v4_450 was used .
The probe arrays were scanned with the Affymetrix GS 3000 scanner .
Raw data are available at ArrayExpress ( , accession number E-MEXP-438 ) .
Data analysis was performed with GeneSpring 6.1 software ( Silicon Genetics ) , applying a significance level P  0.05 .
Furthermore , multiple testing correction was used in addition to obtain cadmium-responsive , MTF-1-independent genes .
Genes were considered to be differentially expressed if there was at least a 2-fold difference in expression levels of the compared experimental groups ( genotype and respective treatment ) .
The result was considered reliable if signal values for the respective gene were scored ` present ' at least for all <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in one experimental group or for two <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> in each of two groups .
To screen for the presence of the MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC in the promoter region , the upstream sequences of the respective genes were obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) Genome Browser Database ( ; October/November 2004 ) ( 28 ) .
All RT -- PCRs were performed with QIAGEN  OneStep RT -- PCR Kit ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using 150 -- 200 ng DNase I-digested total RNA ( RNA isolation see microarray analysis ) .
The reactions were carried out using the following primers : Csrp1 : 5  - TTCCGATGTGCCAAGTGTGGC-3  ; 5  - AGTAGAGAGTGGACATTCAGC-3  , hypoxanthin-guanin-phosphoribosyltransferase ( Hprt ) : 5  - GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCTCG-3  ; 5  - CCACAGGACTAGGACACCTGC-3  , Mtf1 : 5  - GTGACTTTTGAGACTGTACTGAGTG-3  ; 5  - CATGCCAAGAAACATTGAAGGTG-3  , Ndrg1 : 5  - AGATACACAACAACGTGGAGG-3  ; 5  - TGTGCGAGCGGCTTCGGGGGC-3  , Sepw1 : 5  - TAGAGGCAGGGTCCTGAAAGC-3  ; 5  - ACACCTGGAAACATGGCTGCC-3  , Slc39a10 : 5  - GCTGTGGCTGGTAGTAAAAGC-3  ; 5  - GTGGCATGGGATGTAAACAGC-3  .
S1 nuclease mapping of transcripts ( S1 analysis ) .
S1 analysis was performed as previously described ( 29 ) , using 100 g DNase I-digested total RNA ( RNA isolation see microarray analysis ) .
The gels were developed using PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
S1 analysis was done with the following 32P-labeled oligonucleotides : Hprt S1 : 5  - TCTTCAGTCTGATAAAATCTACAGTCATAGGAATGGATCTATCACTATTTCTATTCAGTGATTACATTAAAG-3  , Sepw1 S1 : 5  - TTCAACCGGGAACACCTGGAAACATGGCTGCCTGTCTTCTTGAAGTCTTGAGGTGGAAAGGGAAAGCAAAGCAGGAGGGTTTTCCCACCC-3  .
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay ( EMSA ) .
Protein was extracted from liver tissue with T-PER  Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent ( Pierce ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , using a 1:10 ratio of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> tissue ( mg ) to T-PER reagent ( l ) .
EMSA was essentially performed as previously described ( 10 ) .
All binding reactions were carried out by incubating 2 -- 5 fmol 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides with 100 to 130 g liver protein extract .
For competition experiments , 5 pmol of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction before addition of the extract .
All EMSA gels were developed using PhosphorImager ( Molecular Dynamics ) .
The following oligonucleotides were annealed and used for the reactions : Csrp1 MRE1 : 5  - GGAAACAAAACGGCGCGCACTCCGGCGC-3  ; 5  - GGCTGCGC CGGAGTGCGCGCCGTTTTGT-3  , Csrp1 MRE2 : 5  - TGTTGTGGTGCAGTGTGCAAAGCCTAC-3  ; 5  - ACCAGTAGGCTTTGCACACTGCACCAC-3  , Csrp1 MRE3 : 5  - GAGATCGCCATAGGGTGCAAAGAGAAG-3  ; 5  - GTGACTTCTCTTTGCACCCTATGGCGA-3  , Csrp1 MRE4 : 5  - TGTCTTATTCTGGAGTGCAAGTTAGTC-3  ; 5  - AGGGGACTAACTTGCACTCCAGAATAA-3  , Gal4 : 5  - TCCGGAGGACTGTCCTCCGG-3  ; 5  - GCCGGAGGACAGTCCTCCGG-3  , MREd [ MRE derived from <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Mt1 promoter ( 10 ) ] : 5  - CGAGGGAGCTCTGCACTCCGCCCGAAAAGTG-3  ; 5  - TCGACACTTTTCGGGCGGAGTGCAGAGCTCCCTCGAGCT-3  , MRE-s [ synthetic MRE consensus sequence ( 10 ) ] : 5  - CGAGGGAGCTCTGCACACGGCCCGAAAAGTG-3  ; 5  - TCGACACTTTTCGGGCCGTGTGCAGAGCTCCCTCGAGCT-3  , Ndrg1 MRE1 : 5  - CAGCCCAGGCAGGGTGCAGCACGAG-3  ; 5  - CCGCCTCGTGCTGCACCCTGCCTGG-3  , Ndrg1 MRE2 : 5  - CACACGTTCGCTGCACACGCCGCGG-3  ; 5  - GGGACCGCGGCGTGTGCAGCGAACG-3  , Ndrg1 MRE3 ,4 : 5  - GGAGTCCTTATGCACACGCGCACGAGCGCGCACGGGCAC-3  ; 5  - TGGTGTGCCCGTGCGCGCTCGTGCGCGTGTGCATAAGGAC-3  , Sepw1 MRE1 : 5  - GAGGCAGTCGGCTGTGCGCACGGCCCCACGCTC-3  ; 5  - CTCTGAGCGTGGGGCCGTGCGCACAGCCGACTGC-3  , Sepw1 MRE2 : 5  - ATGGTTTTGGGGGTGCGCAGGGGGTCTG-3  ; 5  - CGACAGACCCCCTGCGCACCCCCAAAAC-3  , Slc39a10 MRE1 : 5  - GAATACACGACTGGGTGCAGCCGGGGTTTGG-3  ; 5  - GGTACCAAACCCCGGCTGCACCCAGTCGTGTA-3  , Slc39a10 MRE2 : 5  - GCGGAGAGGAGATGCACACGGCACTCG-3  ; 5  - CACTCGAGTGCCGTGTGCATCTCCTCT-3  , Specificity protein 1 ( Sp1 ) binding sequence ( 10 ) : 5  - CGAGGCCCCGCCCAG-3  ; 5  - TCGACTGGGCGGGGCCTCGAGct-3  .
Primary embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from a 12.5 day old Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryo and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal <termsem="NCBITaxon:27592"> bovine </term> serum ( ICN ) , 100 U/ml penicillin -- streptomycin ( Gibco BRL ) and 2 mM l-glutamine ( Gibco BRL ) .
100 mm plates with primary cells were transfected with 10 g of an expression plasmid coding for <termsem="NCBITaxon:10633"> simian virus 40 </term> ( <termsem="NCBITaxon:10633"> SV40 </term> ) large T antigen driven by the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10358"> cytomegalovirus </term> ( <termsem="NCBITaxon:10358"> CMV </term> ) promoter , using lipofectamine  reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cell foci were isolated and the immortalized <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryonic fibroblast cell line ckoC was derived from one of them .
The Mtf1loxP genotype of this line as well as the genomic integration of the T antigen were confirmed by PCR .
100 mm plates with these cells were further transfected by the calcium phosphate method ( 30 ) with 19.6 g of an expression plasmid for Cre recombinase driven by the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10358"> CMV </term> promoter and 0.4 g of an expression plasmid for the neomycin resistance gene under the control of the TK promoter .
Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 0.4 g/l G418 ( Calbiochem ) , isolated clones of resistant cells were harvested and grown independently , and the expression of Cre recombinase and excision of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 were analyzed by RT -- PCR .
The cell lines delC19 , delC21 and delC23 with a deletion of Mtf1 were chosen for further experiments .
Samples of 1  104 cells/well were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h .
The cells were then pre-incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0 , 5 , 10 , 25 or 50 M l-buthionine - [ S , R ] - sulfoximine ( BSO ) ( Sigma ) , a drug that inhibits glutathione synthesis ( 31 ) .
Later , cells were exposed to 0 , 5 , 10 or 20 M CdCl2 in the specified pre-incubation medium for an additional 24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT ( 3 - [ 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromid ) - based Cell Proliferation Kit I ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Generation of an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> line .
Using a homologous recombination strategy , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were obtained with a modified Mtf1 allele Mtf1loxP where exons 3 and 4 , encoding four of the six zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain , are flanked by loxP sites ( Figure 1a ) .
<termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mice </term> homozygous for the Mtf1loxP allele were further crossed with <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> of the Cre recombinase transgenic line Mx-cre .
Cre recombinase is expressed in this line under the control of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Mx1 gene promoter , which is inducible by administration of interferon alpha or beta , or synthetic double-stranded RNA pI -- pC ( 32 ) .
Cre-mediated deletion was reported to be complete in the liver , while varying in other tissues , ranging from 94 % in spleen to 8 % in brain ( 32 ) .
After Cre-mediated deletion of exons 3 and 4 , which results in a frameshift and premature translation stop , no functional MTF-1 protein can be produced .
For induction of Cre recombinase , Mtf1 conditional knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> harboring the Mx-cre transgene ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) received four intraperitoneal pI -- pC injections at 3 day intervals ( pI -- pC induction ) ; control littermates without transgene ( Mtf1loxP ) received similar injections .
Using RT -- PCRs ( Figure 1b ) , a shortened product was obtained with RNA from Mtf1Mx-cre livers , indicating a successful excision of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in these <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> .
On close examination , a very faint band similar in size to full-length signal was also observed in those <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , probably due to a low amount of residual full-length Mtf1 mRNA .
The level of functional MTF-1 protein was examined by EMSA ( Figure 1c ) : MTF-1 protein -- DNA complex was detectable with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , but no functional MRE-binding protein was observed with an Mtf1Mx-cre sample .
Thus , deletion of exons 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in the liver of Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> was virtually complete .
All examined liver-specific knockout <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> were viable under laboratory conditions and appeared normal .
MTF-1 target gene search .
For the identification of MTF-1 target genes , we compared the liver transcript profiles of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> with and without functional Mtf1 gene that had been mock-treated or exposed to cadmium ( n = 3 per genotype and respective treatment ) .
In a first screen , the transcripts were analyzed with a differential display-based method , called amplification of double-stranded cDNA end restriction fragments ( ADDER ) ( 33 ) .
Thereby an overwhelming number of signals was obtained for the two stress-inducible metallothioneins ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) , due to the abundance of their transcripts both in mock-treated and especially in cadmium-treated livers that harbored a functional MTF-1 gene ( data not shown ) .
This result confirmed the importance of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothionein genes .
In a second approach , the gene expression profile in livers of the above mentioned <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> was compared by Affymetrix GeneChip  <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> Mouse </term> Genome 430 2.0 Arrays ( Table 1 ) .
When analyzing the probe array data of livers from mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , an at least 2-fold , reliable downregulation of expression was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 13 Affymetrix GeneChip  probe sets corresponding to 11 characterized genes ( Table 1 , a ) .
Seven of these genes contain one or more MRE core consensus sequence TGCRCNC within a segment of 1000 bp upstream of the transcription start .
For 26 probe sets corresponding to 24 different characterized genes , a 2-fold or higher , reliable upregulation was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers ( Table 1 , b ) ; 17 of these 24 genes contain MRE core consensus sequences in the upstream region .
The data set for livers of cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> revealed an at least 2-fold , reliable downregulation in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 21 probe sets corresponding to 16 different characterized genes ( Table 1 , c ) ; 10 of these contain MRE core consensus sequences in their upstream region .
For 9 probe sets corresponding to 9 different characterized genes , an at least 2-fold , reliable upregulation was detected ( Table 1 , d ) ; five of them contain MRE motifs .
In addition to characterized genes , ESTs and RIKEN cDNA sequences were also found in the comparison of Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP livers to be differentially expressed ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .
Downregulation of Mt1 and Mt2 was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for both conditions ( though the level of significance for the downregulation of Mt1 in mock-treated <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> was above 0.05 ; data not shown ) .
For all MTF-1 target genes characterized so far , such as Mt1 , Mt2 and Znt1 , MTF-1 exerts its transcriptional activation activity via standard MRE sequences located proximal to the transcription start ( 4,5,8,18,19 ) .
Even a specific search for MTF-1 binding sites by selection from a pool of double-stranded oligonucleotides with random sequences yielded no new binding motif for MTF-1 in addition to the known MREs ( 34 ) .
Thus , an MRE sequence is to date the only indication for a direct MTF-1 target gene , and four MRE-containing target gene candidates were further analyzed .
Basal expression of Sepw1 depends on MTF-1 .
Sepw1 was found in microarray analysis to be significantly downregulated in livers from cadmium - and mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( Table 1 , a and c ) .
SEPW1 is a selenocysteine-containing protein that binds glutathione ( 35 ) and is thought to act as an antioxidant in vivo ( 36 ) .
Sepw1 expression in livers of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> was further analyzed by semiquantitative RT -- PCRs and S1 analysis ( Figure 2a and b ) .
In accordance with microarray data a slight , if any , upregulation of Sepw1 transcription was observed in livers from Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> upon cadmium treatment .
The basal level was reduced in livers from mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , indicating that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of Sepw1 .
Three MRE core consensus sequences were found in the region upstream of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Sepw1 transcription start ( Figure 2c ) .
Two of them in opposite orientation overlap almost completely proximal to the transcription start ( MRE1 ,  40 bp ) , the third one is located further upstream ( MRE2 ,  527 bp ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 to Sepw1 MRE1 but not MRE2 oligonucleotide was observed in EMSA with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> ( Figure 2d ) .
As a control , no binding to MRE1 was detected with extract from a pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , confirming that the bandshift was indeed dependent on the presence of MTF-1 .
Cadmium response of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Ndrg1 was significantly downregulated in microarrays of liver transcripts from cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> compared to similarly treated Mtf1loxP control <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( Table 1 , c ) .
Ndrg1 probably has some role in stress response since various stimuli , including hypoxia and nickel compounds , activate expression of <termsem="NCBITaxon:9989"> rodent </term> Ndrg1 and/or its <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ortholog ( 37 -- 40 ) .
The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative RT -- PCRs ( Figure 3a ) : for Mtf1loxP control livers , a clear increase of Ndrg1 expression was observed after cadmium exposure ; in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , this cadmium response was not detectable , while basal expression was similar to controls .
This indicates that cadmium-induced expression of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Five MRE core consensus sequences are located upstream of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Ndrg1 transcription start ( Figure 3b ) .
Four of them are clustered ( MRE1 to MRE4 ,  138 to  332 bp ) , the fifth one is located farther upstream ( MRE5 ,  883 bp ) .
EMSA was performed to test whether MTF-1 is interacting with some or all of the four proximal MRE sequences ( Figure 3c ) .
Separate oligonucleotides were tested for MRE1 and MRE2 , whereas one oligonucleotide spanning both sequences was used for MRE3 and MRE4 ( MRE3 ,4 ) .
No complex was seen with MRE1 , but specific MTF-1 complexes were observed for both the MRE2 and MRE3 ,4 oligonucleotides with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> .
As expected , no bandshift was observed with protein extract from a <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> lacking MTF-1 ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) .
Cadmium response of Csrp1 depends on MTF-1 .
Csrp1 was found in microarray analyses to be significantly downregulated in cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> compared to Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( Table 1 , c ) .
CSRP1 is a member of the evolutionary conserved CRP family of proteins that have been implicated in myogenesis and cytoskeletal remodeling ( 41,42 ) .
Semiquantitative RT -- PCRs confirmed the microarray results , namely , that Csrp1 expression is elevated in Mtf1loxP livers upon cadmium exposure ( Figure 4a ) .
In contrast , no cadmium response was detectable in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , suggesting that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction of Csrp1 .
Three MRE core consensus sequences were found upstream of the Csrp1 transcription start ( MRE2 to MRE4 ,  56 to  366 bp ) , one was found immediately downstream ( MRE1 , +7 bp ; Figure 4b ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed with EMSA for MRE2 oligonucleotide and protein extract from an Mtf1loxP liver , but not an Mtf1Mx-cre liver extract lacking MTF-1 , confirming the participation of MTF-1 in the complex ( Figure 4c ) .
MTF-1 inhibits expression of Slc39a10 .
Slc39a10 was detected in microarray analysis to be significantly upregulated in livers from both mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> compared to control <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> ( Table 1 , b and d ) .
SLC39 proteins are members of the Zrt - and Irt-like protein ( ZIP ) family of metal ion transporters that transport , with no known exception , metal ion substrates across cellular membranes into the cytoplasm ( 43,44 ) .
In accordance with microarray data , semiquantitative RT -- PCRs showed a downregulation of Slc39a10 expression in livers of Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> upon cadmium exposure .
In samples from Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , the basal expression was significantly increased ; cadmium treatment still resulted in a decrease of Slc39a10 expression ( Figure 5a ) .
It can not be judged by this experiment whether the degree of cadmium-induced reduction of Slc39a10 transcription was identical for Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> or lower in the absence of MTF-1 .
In microarray analysis , the degree of the downregulation was either comparable to the one in control livers or lower , depending on the considered Affymetrix GeneChip  probe set ( data not shown ) .
The results indicate that MTF-1 is involved in repression of the basal expression of Slc39a10 .
It might also participate in the cadmium response of this gene , but it is apparently not exclusively responsible .
One MRE core consensus sequence was found just upstream of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Slc39a10 transcription start ( MRE1 ,  21 bp ) , another one directly downstream ( MRE2 , +17 bp ; Figure 5b ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed in EMSA analysis for MRE2 with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP but not from an Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , while no binding was detected with MRE1 ( Figure 5c ) .
Finally , we also identified a number of cadmium-responsive genes that were independent of MTF-1 presence , by comparing the probe array data of all cadmium-treated <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> with the data of all mock-treated <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> , irrespective of the genotype ( Table 2 ) .
An at least 2-fold , reliable upregulation was observed after cadmium exposure for 31 probe sets corresponding to 21 different characterized genes ( Table 2 , a ) .
For 2 probe sets corresponding to 2 characterized genes , an at least 2-fold downregulation was detected ( Table 2 , b ) .
Several genes involved in the metabolism of the antioxidant glutathione were found to be upregulated by cadmium exposure , namely the genes encoding the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase ( Gclc ) that is the rate limiting enzyme in de novo synthesis of glutathione ( 45 ) ; glutathione reductase 1 ( Gsr ) , the reducing enzyme for oxidized glutathione ( 45 ) ; and glutathione-S-transferase , mu 4 ( Gstm4 ) , which is a member of the glutathione-S-transferase supergene family of detoxification enzymes ( 45 ) .
In all of these cases , induction was confirmed by semiquantitative RT -- PCRs ( data not shown ) .
Gclc , also referred to as heavy chain subunit of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase ( Ggcs-hc ) , had been discussed previously as a target gene of MTF-1 ( 6 ) .
Our expression data indicate that Gclc is induced by cadmium but , at least in the adult <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> liver , not dependent on MTF-1 .
To analyze the role of the glutathione system in the cellular cadmium response , <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryonic fibroblasts with and without functional Mtf1 were treated with cadmium in combination with BSO , a specific inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase ( 31 ) , and cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium salt MTT ( Figure 6 ) .
Increasing concentrations of BSO or cadmium alone were to some extent cytotoxic for the examined cell lines .
Treatment with both BSO and cadmium resulted in an enhanced lethality particularly for the cells without functional Mtf1 , indicating that a depletion of glutathione together with a lack of Mtf1 impair an efficient anti-cadmium defense .
Thus , adequate glutathione supply as well as MTF-1 and its target genes are essential for the survival of the cell under cadmium stress .
Besides genes related to the glutathione pathway , several other stress-related genes were upregulated upon cadmium exposure , including genes for thioredoxin reductase 1 ( Txnrd1 ) , one of the reducing enzymes of the antioxidant thioredoxin ( 46 ) ; KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2 ( Kdelr2 ) participating in ER stress response ( 47 ) ; and the anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 ( Bag3 ) involved in stress-induced apoptosis ( 48 ) .
In this study , a virtually complete deletion of Mtf1 in the liver of adult , pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> under non-stress conditions , confirming that MTF-1 is dispensable in the adult liver ( 26 ) , in contrast to its essential role in embryonic liver development ( 23 ) .
The comparison of gene expression in livers of mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> revealed several MTF-1 target gene candidates .
Transcripts of the two stress-responsive metallothionein genes Mt1 and Mt2 were severely reduced , in support of a crucial role of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothioneins ( 4,6 ) .
One of the newly found target genes is Sepw1 .
The exact molecular function of SEPW1 protein is unknown to date , but a role as antioxidant has been proposed due to its ability to bind glutathione ( 35 ) .
In accordance with this , ectopic expression of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Sepw1 renders cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide , and this resistance is dependent on it binding glutathione ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , Amantana et al. ( 49 ) showed that expression of a reporter gene fused to a <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> Sepw1 promoter fragment can be induced in <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> glial cells by copper and zinc , but not cadmium .
This response was dependent on an overlapping-inverted MRE sequence located proximal to the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> Sepw1 transcription start ( 49 ) , even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF-1 binding to that sequence ( 50 ) .
Our expression and DNA-binding studies strongly suggest that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Sepw1 by binding to the corresponding overlapping-inverted MRE sequence .
Ndrg1 , another interesting MTF-1 target gene was named N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 following the discovery that the transcription factor N-myc represses the expression of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Ndrg1 ( 51 ) .
Transcription of Ndrg1 and/or its <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ortholog is induced by different physiological and cell stress conditions , such as androgens , nickel compounds , DNA damage and hypoxia ( 37 -- 40,52,53 ) .
In addition , the protein is overexpressed in <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> cancers of many tissues , such as lung , liver , brain , breast , kidney and skin ( 40 ) .
Although Ndrg1 and especially its <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> ortholog have been quite intensely studied , its function remains unclear ; however , the induction by stimuli like nickel and hypoxia suggests an involvement in the cell stress response .
Such a role is strongly endorsed by our finding that Ndrg1 gene expression is also induced by cadmium , and that MTF-1 plays a crucial role in this induction .
In the case of Csrp1 , expression analyses and DNA-binding studies indicate that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction by binding to an MRE upstream of the transcription start .
Studies with <termsem="NCBITaxon:9606"> human </term> , <termsem="NCBITaxon:8782"> avian </term> and <termsem="NCBITaxon:9031"> chicken </term> CSRP1 have shown that this protein is localized at adhesion plaques and in association with filamentous actin , and interacts with the adhesion plaque protein zyxin , as well as the actin-cross-linking protein alpha-actinin ( 54 -- 57 ) .
The ability to bind these partners suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization ( 58 ) .
Exposure of cultured cells to cadmium causes a decrease in , and destruction of , cellular contact proteins and the actin cytoskeleton ( 59 ) .
In the proximal tubule cells of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10114"> rat </term> kidney , a partial loss of actin and the actin-bundling protein villin is observed upon cadmium treatment , as well as the derangement and depolymerization of microtubules ( 60 ) .
Assuming that CSRP1 is important for the organization of cytoskeletal elements in the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> , its upregulation by cadmium might protect the <termsem="NCBITaxon:1"> organism </term> from damage of the cytoskeleton .
Such a mechanism would expand the role of MTF-1 in stress response .
Our expression studies also suggest that MTF-1 represses basal transcription of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as activator for the expression of other target genes like Mt1 , Mt2 , and Znt1 ( 4,19 ) .
SLC39A10 is one of 14 <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> SLC39 members , which belong to the ZIP family of metal ion transporters ( 43,44 ) .
All members of the ZIP family characterized so far increase intracellular cytoplasmic metal ion concentrations by promoting extracellular and vesicular ion transport into the cytoplasm .
ZIP proteins have been reported to be transporters of zinc , iron , manganese and/or cadmium ( 44,61 -- 63 ) .
Although SLC39A10 is largely uncharacterized ( 44 ) , it is referred to in several databases as putative zinc transporter .
It has been previously shown that MTF-1 is important for both basal expression and metal induction of the <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> Znt1 gene ( 19 ) .
ZnT proteins represent a different family of transporters that reduce intracellular cytoplasmic zinc by promoting zinc efflux from cells or into intracellular vesicles .
Thus , members of the ZnT and ZIP family with zinc as predominant substrate have opposite roles in cellular zinc homeostasis ( 43 ) .
Assuming that SLC39A10 is indeed a zinc transporter , MTF-1 would control expression of two zinc transporters with antagonistic functions , namely , Znt1 and Slc39a10 .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed for an MRE located just downstream of the Slc39a10 transcription start .
In a simple model , such a binding could interfere with the accessibility of the transcriptional start site for RNA polymerase II and/or general transcription factors , thus preventing transcription initiation of the gene .
Indeed , such a mechanism has been described in <termsem="NCBITaxon:4892"> yeast </term> for the zinc-responsive activator protein 1 ( Zap1 ) and its target gene , zinc-regulated transporter 2 ( ZRT2 ) ( 64 ) .
However , the inhibition of Slc39a10 expression by MTF-1 may well be more complex than a competition for promoter binding .
Independent of MTF-1 , cadmium treatment also leads to downregulation of Slc39a10 transcripts , suggesting that some other factor is mediating this response .
A previous target gene search for MTF-1 with <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryos of conventional Mtf1 knockout phenotype revealed , besides metallothionein genes , the multifunctional alpha-fetoprotein ( Afp ) and the liver-enriched transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha ( Cebpa ) as prime candidates ( 65 ) .
After an early onset during hepatogenesis , Afp expression is repressed postnatally and replaced by albumin ( 66 ) .
Thus , our adult Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> lacking MTF-1 were not suitable to analyze Afp expression .
Cebpa is expressed in the adult liver as well as in other tissues ( 67 ) , but the present microarray data revealed no significant expression differences in livers from adult Mtf1loxP and Mtf1Mx-cre <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , MTF-1 may affect Cebpa expression only during embryonal development , perhaps in combination with as yet unidentified factors .
The present study confirms and extends the role of MTF-1 as an important stress response regulator .
We have identified and preliminarily characterized four target genes of MTF-1 in the adult <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> liver : in the case of Sepw1 , MTF-1 is required to maintain basal expression , supporting a role of <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> MTF-1 in oxidative stress response .
In addition , MTF-1 contributes to the cadmium-induced expression of Ndrg1 and Csrp1 .
Furthermore , MTF-1 helps to repress the basal expression of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as transcriptional activator for genes like Mt1 , Mt2 or Znt1 .
Thus the same transcription factor apparently serves as an activator or repressor , depending on the target gene .
The comparison of liver gene expression of cadmium - and mock-treated <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mice </term> also revealed a number of genes that were responsive to cadmium exposure , independent of the presence or absence of MTF-1 .
Evidence suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species is a major effect of acute cadmium toxicity ( 68,69 ) , and exposure of cultured cells or <termsem="NCBITaxon:33208"> animals </term> to cadmium is associated with depletion of reduced glutathione , lipid peroxidation and DNA damage ( 70 -- 73 ) .
Oxidative stress and the subsequent restoration of cellular homeostasis have been shown to induce the expression of genes encoding acute-phase proteins and antioxidant enzymes ( 74 ) .
In <termsem="NCBITaxon:40674"> mammals </term> , cadmium tends to accumulate in the kidney and liver as a cadmium-metallothionein complex that has an extremely slow turnover ( 75,76 ) .
Furthermore , metallothioneins provide protection against oxidative stress ( 1,17 ) .
In addition to metallothioneins , glutathione was postulated as a first line of defense against cadmium toxicity ( 77 ) .
Glutathione efficiently complexes cadmium ( 78 ) and scavenges free radicals and other reactive oxygen species directly , and indirectly via enzymatic reactions ( 45 ) .
In such reactions , glutathione is oxidized and has to be regenerated by glutathione reductase .
Also , glutathione-S-transferases mediate the conjugation of various electrophiles to glutathione .
The observed cadmium-induced upregulation of Gclc , Gsr and Gstm4 supports the importance of glutathione in the cellular cadmium response .
The enhanced sensitivity to cadmium toxicity that we found for <termsem="NCBITaxon:10088"> mouse </term> embryonic fibroblasts upon a combination of Mtf1 deletion and depletion of glutathione further corroborates the importance of MTF-1 and its target genes as well as reduced glutathione for an efficient anti-cadmium defense .
Our data provide strong evidence for at least two branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense , one via MTF-1 and its target genes , notably metallothioneins , the other via glutathione , with an apparent overlap in Sepw1 .
