Structure-function evolution of the Transforming acidic <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> revealed by analysis of phylogenetically diverse organisms .
Examination of ancient <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families can provide an insight into how the evolution of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure can relate to function .
Functional <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologs </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionarily conserved </term> transforming acidic <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> ( TACC ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family are present in organisms from yeast to man .
However , correlations between functional interactions and the evolution of these proteins have yet to be determined .
We have performed an extensive database analysis to determine the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> and <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> of the TACCs from phylogenetically diverse organisms .
This analysis has determined the phylogenetic relationship of the TACC proteins to other <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> proteins , the resolution of the placement of the rabbit TACC4 as the <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologue </term> of human TACC3 , and RHAMM as a distinct family of <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> proteins .
We have also extended the analysis of the TACCs to the interaction databases of C. elegans and D. melanogaster to identify potentially novel TACC interactions .
The validity of this modeling was confirmed independently by the demonstration of direct binding of human TACC2 to the nuclear hormone receptor RXR .
The data so far suggest that the ancestral TACC protein played a role in centrosomal/mitotic spindle dynamics .
TACC proteins were then recruited to complexes involved in protein translation , <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> processing and transcription by interactions with specific bridging proteins .
However , during evolution , the TACC proteins have now acquired the ability to directly interact with components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins , nuclear hormone receptors , GAS41 , and transcription factors ) .
This suggests that the function of the TACC proteins may have evolved from performing assembly or coordination functions in the centrosome to include a more intimate role in the functional evolution of chromatin remodeling , transcriptional and posttranscriptional complexes in the cell .
The evolution of complex organisms has been associated with the generation of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families by the continual <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of an initial relatively small set of ancestral <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Through this process , followed by subsequent <termsem="SO:0000041"> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> </term> , reduplication and <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> shuffling between <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have evolved both discrete , and partially redundant functions with their related family members .
With the completion of the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> sequencing projects of human , mouse , rat , fruit fly and nematodes , we are now in a position to ask fundamental questions in regard to how <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> interact in the context of the whole organism .
Thus , with the appropriate application of bioinformatics , it is now possible to trace the lineage of particular <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families , with related <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families in other organisms .
Furthermore , with the growing amount of large-scale proteomic and <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> data becoming publicly available , this analysis can now be extended to reveal the complex interplay between evolution of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure and protein function .
The first Transforming acidic <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , TACC1 , was identified during the development of an expression map of the proximal short arm of human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8 [ 1 ] .
Two additional TACC family members were subsequently identified and mapped to <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> regions </term> on human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> 4p16 and 10q26 , physically close to members of the FGFR <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family [ 1-3 ] .
This mapping data , together with identification of a single TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in the protostomes Caenorhabitis elegans , and Drosophila melanogaster [ 4-6 ] , led to the speculation that the ancestral FGFR and TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were located physically close to each other .
Thus , during the evolution of vertebrates , subsequent successive <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplications </term> of the ancestral <termsem="SO:0005851"> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> cluster </term> have given rise to three TACC family members located close to FGFR <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in humans .
In accordance with the proposed quadruplication of the vertebrate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> during evolution , there is a fourth FGFR family member in vertebrates , raising the question of whether a fourth TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is associated with FGFR4 in vertebrate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomes </term> .
To date , only three active TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have been cloned in humans [ 1-3 ] , one in each of mouse [ 7 ] , Xenopus laevis [ 8 ] , D. melanogaster [ 4 ] , and C. elegans [ 5,6 ] .
Although two additional new candidate TACC family members , Oryctolagus cuniculus TACC4 [ 9 ] and human RHAMM [ 10 ] have been proposed , their true identity and placement in the evolution of the TACC family is under debate .
Thus , the identification and functional characterization of new members of the TACC family in other organisms , <termsem="SO:1001187"> alternatively spliced isoforms </term> of each TACC and comparison of the phylogenetic relationship of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> relative to other members of the <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> superfamily will resolve this issue and provide clues to the evolution of TACC function .
In silico identification of TACC family members from vertebrate and invertebrate lineages .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> similarity searches of the publicly available <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> databases with the BLAST and TBLAST programs were performed to identify TACC and RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> , and other members of the <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> superfamily in a diverse set of species ( Fig. 1 ) .
This identified the complete <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in representatives of five major phylogenetically distinct clades .
Where possible , the construction of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from these organisms was also confirmed by the analysis of the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> databases .
Several <termsem="SO:0000731"> partial </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in other vertebrate species , the echinodermate Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the protostome insect Anopheles gambiae were also identified , suggesting an ancient <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in metazoan lineages .
However , due to the relative infancy of the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> / <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> projects for these latter organisms , complete characterization of these TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> could not be undertaken .
No conclusion could be made about the existence of TACC-like <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> in non-bilaterian metazoans , such as Cnidaria or Porifera , due to the paucity of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> information for these organisms , and additional definitive <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> with a defined TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> could not be found in other non-metazoan organisms .
Phylogenetic analysis of the TACC family members compared to other <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> proteins .
The phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the Methods section .
The TACC family defines a separate subfamily of <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> containing proteins , distinct from other <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> families such as the keratins , RHAMM and tropomyosins .
Note that the RHAMM proteins form a separate branch more closely related to the tropomyosins and kinesin like proteins ( KLP ) , than the TACC proteins .
At the base of the chordate branch of life , a single TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was identified in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis [ 11 ] , and a <termsem="SO:0000731"> partial </term> TACC <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> from an analysis of the Halocynthia rortezi <termsem="SO:0000345"> EST </term> database [ 12 ] .
This confirms the original assumption that a single TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was present in the chordate ancestor .
The next major event in the evolution of the chordate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> has been suggested to have occurred 687  155.7 million years ago ( MYA ) , with the first <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the chordate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , and a second <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> occurring shortly thereafter .
Thus , if the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were duplicated at both events , we would expect to identify four TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the most `` primitive '' compact vertebrate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> sequenced to date , the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes , with three <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> corresponding to the human TACC1-3 , and , in keeping with the proposed model for <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> loci </term> for the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( discussed below ) , a possible fourth <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> deriving from the TACC3 ancestor .
Indeed , four TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified in T. rubripes .
Of these , two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> corresponded to the T. rubripes <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of human TACC2 and TACC3 .
However , the other two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , trTACC1A and trTACC1B are clearly most related to TACC1 ( Fig. 1 ) .
Although trTACC1A is highly <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> to trTACC1B , the latter encodes a significantly smaller <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> protein .
The trTACC1B <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is encoded by 15 <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> over approximately 7 kb of the Takifugu <termsem="SO:0001248"> Scaffold </term> 191 ( see below ) .
A search of this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> using the trTACC1A <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> and <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> prediction software has so far failed to identify additional <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> of trTACC1B .
However , given the <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> / <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> structure of this apparently complete <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , it appears likely that trTACC1B is active in the pufferfish , and presumably fulfils either a temporal-spatial specific function within the organism , or a distinct function from the larger trTACC1A product within the cell .
Thus , based upon the surrounding <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> loci </term> ( see below ) , the trTACC1A and trTACC1B <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> appear to have arisen from the <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segment </term> containing the teleost TACC1 ancestor , during the additional partial <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> that occurred in the teleost lineage .
Therefore , this analysis of T. rubripes does not support the hypothesis that the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> surrounding the TACC3 ancestor was included in the second round of vertebrate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> .
Examination of higher vertebrates led to the identification of <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice variants </term> of TACC1 and TACC2 in Mus musculus , and the assembly of the previously unidentified <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of TACC1-3 from Rattus norvegus .
In addition , the TACC1X <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> was found on mouse <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> X .
This <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is clearly related to the mouse TACC1 , however , further examination revealed a mouse B1 <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat </term> </term> distributed over the length of the proposed <termsem="SO:0000188"> intron </term> .
In addition , no expression of TACC1X was detected in mouse <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> by rt-PCR analysis ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is a <termsem="SO:0000043"> processed pseudogene </term> .
Similarly , TACC1 <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> also exist spread over 22 kb of the centromeric region of human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 10 and , in 8q21 , a shorter <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> 86 % identical to the final 359 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> of the TACC1 <termsem="SO:0000205"> 3 ' untranslated region </term> .
No <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> corresponding to TACC2 or TACC3 were identified in any mammalian species .
Characterization of vertebrate TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> .
Based upon current functional analysis , the characterization of TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> is likely to be pivotal to understanding the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> and functional evolution of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
As indicated below , the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> region </term> containing the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> precursors was duplicated twice during vertebrate evolution .
Although the analysis of T. rubripes , rodents and humans so far suggests that the vertebrate TACC3 precursor was not included in the second round of <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> , it could not be excluded that a TACC4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> may have been <termsem="SO:0000045"> lost </term> during the evolution of these lineages .
The cloning of a new member of the TACC family in Oryctolagus cuniculus has added to this controversy [ 9 ] .
Designated TACC4 , the 1.5 kb <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was highly related , but proposed to be distinct from TACC3 .
However , Northern blot data suggested that this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> produces a single 2.3 kb <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> [ 9 ] , indicating that the cloned <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was <termsem="SO:0000731"> incomplete </term> .
The degree of similarity to the published <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of human and mouse TACC3 suggested to us that TACC4 actually represents a <termsem="SO:0000731"> partial </term> rabbit TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> .
To test this hypothesis , we set out to clone the complete rabbit TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> , based upon the <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> <termsem="SO:0000110"> features </term> of human and mouse TACC3 .
We have previously noted that the N-terminal and <termsem="SO:0100015"> C-terminal regions </term> of the human and mouse TACC3 proteins are highly <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> ( [ 2 ] , see below ) .
Therefore , based upon the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> identity between these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , we designed a <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> , T3con2 , that would be suitable for the identification of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> containing the initiator <termsem="SO:0001442"> methionine </term> of the TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> from primates and rodents .
Using this <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> , in combination with the TACC4-specific RACE <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> ( RACE2 ) , initially used by Steadman et al [ 9 ] , we isolated a 1.5 kb <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> from rabbit brain <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> by rt-PCR .
In combination with 3 ` RACE , this generated a <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> of 2283 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> which corresponds to the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> size of 2.3 kb detected by the `` TACC4 '' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> reported in Figure 4 of Steadman et al [ 9 ] .
Thus , while it remains possible that the `` TACC4 '' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is an <termsem="SO:1001187"> alternative splice product </term> , or is the product of reduplication of the TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( events that would be specific to the rabbit ) , the only <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> detected in rabbit <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> corresponds to the <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> size of the TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> that we have identified here .
Furthermore , the <termsem="SO:0000348"> string of <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotides </term> </term> found at the 5 ' end of the `` TACC4 '' <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is also found at the 5 ' ends of a number of <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> ( e.g. U82468 , NM_023500 ) , that were isolated by 5 ` RACE , suggesting that they may correspond to an artefact of the 5 ` RACE methodology used in their construction .
The rabbit `` TACC4 '' and the rabbit TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> that we have isolated are also found on the same branch of the TACC phylogenetic tree with the other TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> , including maskin ( Xenopus laevis ) , and the newly identified TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> in Rattus norvegus , Gallus gallus , Silurana tropicalis , Danio rerio and T. rubripes , reported in this manuscript ( Fig. 1 ) .
Thus , it is not in a separate branch that may be expected if the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> was a distinct TACC family member .
Placement of the RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in the phylogeny of the <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
Human RHAMM has also been proposed to be the missing fourth member of the TACC family [ 10 ] .
Evidence used in support of this claim included its <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> location </term> on 5q32 in humans ( discussed below ) , its <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity in its <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> to the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and the subcellular localization of the RHAMM protein in the centrosome .
However , if RHAMM were a bona fide TACC family member , then we would predict its evolution would be similar to those of other TACC family members , and fit with the proposed evolution of the vertebrate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
Thus , we set out to identify RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> and related <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in metazoans , so that a more complete phylogeny of the <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> super family could be generated .
We identified a single RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in all deuterostomes for which cDNA and/or <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequence </term> was available , including C. intestinalis .
No RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was identified in insects or nematodes .
This indicates that the RHAMM/TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> diverged after the protostome/deuterostome split 833 -- 933 MYA , but prior to the echinodermata/urochordate divergence ( > 750 MYA ) .
Significantly , <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> and phylogenetic analysis of <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> proteins ( Fig. 1 ) clearly shows that RHAMM does not contain a TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> and instead forms a distinct family of proteins in the <termsem="SO:0001080"> coiled coil </term> superfamily , and is not a direct descendant of the ancestral TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Evolution of the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segments </term> containing the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
The phylogenetic tree of the FGFR <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> closely resembles that of the vertebrate TACC1-3 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Recently , detailed analyses of the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> regions </term> containing the FGFR <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family in humans , mouse and the arthopod D. melanogaster have revealed the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> of <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segments </term> between these organisms ( Fig. 2 , [ 13 ] , Table 1 [ see Additional file 1 ] ) .
This has provided further support that an ancient <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segment </term> was duplicated twice during vertebrate evolution , with the first <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> that gave rise to the human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 4p16/5q32-ter and human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8p/10q23-ter ancestors occurring in the early stages after the invertebrate divergence .
This suggests that the ancestral FGFR-TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> pair most probably arose prior to the initial <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> and subsequent divergence of these <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segments </term> , estimated to have occurred 687  155.7 MYA .
This has raised the suggestion that a fourth TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in vertebrates would reside in the same <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> region </term> as FGFR4 .
Indeed this hypothesis has been used in support for the RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> as a member of the TACC family [ 10 ] .
Human RHAMM maps to <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 5q32 in a <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> bounded by GPX3 and NKX2E .
These <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> separate two <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> </term> on human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 5 that are <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> with 4p16 .
Interestingly , these three <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> are located on different <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> in mouse and rat ( Fig. 2 ) , further suggesting that this <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> </term> was transposed into this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> after the primate/rodent divergence .

<termsem="SO:0000859"> Paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> present in at least two of the four <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> are shown , with the exception of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> between GPX3 and NKX2E on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 5 , which appears to represent a series of intervening <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> after <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the 4p16/5q32 -35 <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> , and <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> mentioned in Fig. 3 .
Corresponding <termsem="SO:0000860"> syntenic </term> mouse <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> regions </term> ( mm * ) are indicated .
Takifugu rubripes <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffolds </term> are shown ( TR * ) that contain more than one <termsem="SO:0000857"> homologous </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> from these <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> .
Further details on the <termsem="SO:0000001"> location </term> of <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> can be found in [ see Additional file 1 ] .
Because the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> order can also provide clues to the evolution of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> regulation , we next attempted to trace the evolution of these <termsem="SO:0000854"> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> segments </term> by examining the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> of the tunicate C. intestinalis [ 11 ] and the most `` primitive '' compact vertebrate <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> sequenced to date , T. rubripes [ 14 ] .
Although not fully assembled , examination of the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> of T. rubripes confirmed the presence of <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segments </term> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> to those found in higher vertebrates ( Fig. 2 ) .
For instance , the <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of GPRK2L and RGS12 are found on T. rubripes <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> 290 ( emb | CAAB01000290 .1 ) , and within 300 kb of each other in human 4p16 .
The T. rubripes <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of FGFR3 , LETM1 and WHSC1 are located on the same 166 kb <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> 251 ( emb | CAAB01000166 .1 ) .
Significantly , the three human <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are also located within 300 kb of each other on 4p16 .
Furthermore , TACC3 and FGFRL map to the <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffolds </term> 1184/4669 ( emb | CAAB01004668 ) .
Similarly , elements of these <termsem="SO:0005851"> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> clusters </term> , extending from HMP19 to GPRK6 in human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 5q34-ter are also found in the pufferfish , with the T. rubripes <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of NSD1 , FGFR4 and a RAB-like <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> mapping on <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> 407 ( emb | CAAB01000407 ) .
However , there is no evidence for a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> corresponding to a TACC4 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in any of these <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> .
As noted above , phylogenetic analysis of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> indicate that there are two TACC1 related <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the pufferfish .
trTACC1B is located on the 180 kb <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> 191 ( emb | CAAB01000191 .1 ) , which also contains the <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> located in human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8p21-11 .
Thus , this <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> represents the more `` developed '' TACC1 <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segment </term> that is evident in higher vertebrates .
On the other hand , the trTACC1A <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is located in the 396 kb <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> 12 ( emb | CAAB010012 .1 ) .
This <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> also contains the T. rubripes <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of MSX1 , STX18 , D4S234E and the <termsem="SO:0000996"> <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> gene </term> LOC118711 , in addition to <termsem="SO:0000853"> sequences with <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> </term> to LOXL , EVC , LOC159291 , and the LDB family .
Thus , <termsem="SO:0001248"> scaffold </term> 12 contains <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> found in the regions of human <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 4 and 10 that also contain the <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> for TACC3 and TACC2 , respectively , and may therefore more closely resemble the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> organization resulting from the initial <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the ancestral <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segment </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000856"> Conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters </term> may result from the initial clustering of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in a relatively small ancestral <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000149"> contig </term> .
Some evidence for the existence of `` protoclusters '' that could correspond to the <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segments </term> noted in higher vertebrates is present in the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> of the urochordate C. intestinalis [ 11 ] .
For instance , the <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> of FGFR , and WHSC1 , carboxypeptidase Z and FLJ25359 <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> within an 85 kb <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of the C. intestinalis <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> and the human <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> are still maintained in <termsem="SO:0000854"> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> segments </term> of 4p16 , 8p and 10q ( Fig. 3 , [ see Additional file 1 ] ) .
However , it should be noted that no <termsem="SO:0005851"> clusters of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> </term> from the vertebrate <termsem="SO:0000854"> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> segments </term> are locate close to the TACC or RHAMM <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of C. intestinalis , indicating that the formation of the much larger <termsem="SO:0000854"> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> segments </term> encompassing the FGFR-TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> formed later in evolutionary time , or conversely have been subject to extensive rearrangement in tunicates .
In combination with the examination of the T. rubripes <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , this also provides additional evidence that either the second round of <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> segment </term> that contained the FGFR3/4 ancestor did not include a TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , or that such a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was lost very early in vertebrate evolution , prior to the divergence of the Gnanthostome lineages .
However , the final resolution of the initial evolution of these <termsem="SO:0000854"> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> segment </term> will await the sequencing of the amphioxus and lamprey <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomes </term> , which only have one FGFR <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , and therefore should only contain one copy of the other corresponding <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in this <termsem="SO:0000330"> <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> segment </term> .

In some cases , for rat and pufferfish , <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> were <termsem="SO:0000046"> added </term> or <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> based on the best similarity of translated <termsem="SO:0001407"> peptides </term> to the corresponding mouse and human proteins .
For <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> with low <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> similarity in T. rubripes , <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> sequences </term> from the fresh water pufferfish , Tetraodon nigroviridis were used as additional means to verify the <termsem="SO:0000732"> predicted </term> <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> .
The general structure of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and proteins is depicted in Fig. 4 .
The main <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0000110"> feature </term> of the TACC family , the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , is located at the <termsem="SO:0100015"> carboxy terminus </term> of the protein .
In the case of the C. elegans TAC protein , this structure comprises the majority of the protein and is encoded by two of the three <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
In the higher organisms , D. melanogaster , and the deuterostomes C. intestinalis to human , this <termsem="SO:0000110"> feature </term> is also encoded by the final <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( five in D. melanogaster , seven in the deuterostome <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ) .
Outside of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , however , TACC family members show relatively little <termsem="SO:0000857"> homology </term> .
It is interesting that each TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> contains one large <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> , which shows considerable variability between TACC <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> , and constitutes the main difference between the TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the vertebrates ( see below ) .
In deuterostomes , this <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> contains the SDP <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat </term> </term> ( or in the case of the murine TACC3 's , a rodent-specific 24 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat </term> </term> ) , which is responsible for the binding of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex component GAS41 [ 15,16 ] .
Of the vertebrate TACC proteins , the TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> show the greatest variability in size and <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> , ranging in size from 599 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> for the rat TACC3 protein , to 942 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> in the Danio rerio protein .
The reasons for these differences are apparent from the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> structure of the TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> .
TACC3 can be divided into three sections : a <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> <termsem="SO:0100014"> N-terminal region </term> ( CNTR ) of 108 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acids </term> , encoded by <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 2 and 3 in each vertebrate TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> distributed over the final seven <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> , and a highly variable central <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
The lack of <termsem="SO:0000856"> conservation </term> in both size and <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of the central <termsem="SO:0000001"> portion </term> of the TACC3 proteins of human and mouse has been previously noted , and accounts for the major difference between these two <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> [ 2 ] .
The majority of this central <termsem="SO:0000001"> portion </term> , which contains the SDP <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat motifs </term> </term> , is encoded by one <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> in human and the pufferfish ( emb | CAAB01001184 ) .
In rodents , however , this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> is almost entirely composed of seven 24 <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> , which are located in a single <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> of the mouse and rat TACC3 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
It has been previously reported that there are four mouse TACC3 <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice variants </term> that differ in the number of these <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> [ 2,7,17 ] .
As these <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> are present in a single <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> , it appears likely that these different <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> may be the result of the <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> polymerases used in the <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> synthesis and/or PCR reaction stuttering through the <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat motif </term> </term> .
The correct <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> , reported by Sadek et al [ 7 ] , is the one used throughout the entirety of this manuscript .
These <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeats </term> </term> are not evident in the rabbit protein , or any other TACC protein , and may indicate that the rodent TACC3 has evolved distinct functions , as has already been noted for the amphibian Xenopus TACC3 , maskin [ 8 ] .
Alternative splicing in vertebrate TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Whereas <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> shuffling can drive the functional diversification of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families over evolutionary time , the temporal and/or tissue specific alternative splicing of a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> can give rise to functional diversification of a single <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> during the development of an organism .
Although no alternative splicing of TACC3 has been clearly documented , both temporal and tissue specific splicing is observed in the TACC1 and TACC2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
In the case of TACC2 , an additional large ( 5 kb ) <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> accounts for the main difference between the major <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice variants </term> of the vertebrate TACC2 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 3 ] .
The alternative splicing of this <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> suggests a major functional difference between the two TACC2 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> , TACC2s and TACC2l [ 3 ] , as well as a significant difference between TACC2 and its closest TACC family relative , TACC1 .
However , the function of this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> of the TACC2l <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> is current unknown .
Alternative splicing , together with differential <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> usage has already been noted for the human TACC1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> [ 18,19 ] .
In addition , as shown in Fig. 5 , we have identified additional TACC1 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> that result from alternative splicing of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 1b-4a .
The functions of these <termsem="SO:0001060"> different isoforms </term> are unknown , however the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> from the shorter <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> can include the <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding site </term> for LSm7 [ 20 ] ( <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> C , D , F-I ) , and/or the nuclear localization <termsem="SO:0000418"> <termsem="SO:0000725"> signals </term> </term> and <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding site </term> for GAS41 [ 15 ] and PCTAIRE2BP [ 20 ] ( <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> B-D , S ) .
One of these <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> , TACC1S is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm [ 19 ] , suggesting that the shorter <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> would not be able to interact with elements of the chomatin remodeling and/or <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> processing machinery in the nucleus .
Thus , changes in the complement of TACC1 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> in the cell may result in alterations in cellular <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> metabolism at multiple levels , and may account for the observation that TACC1D and TACC1F <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> are associated with tumorigenic changes in gastric mucosa [ 18 ] .
Alternative splicing of the human TACC1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
( A ) : Seven <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice variants </term> have been identified for human TACC1 ( A-F and S ) .
We have also identified additional <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice variants </term> ( G-I ) from database analysis and rt-PCR analysis of human brain <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> .
( B ) : Alternative splicing of TACC1 in the human brain .
rt-PCR analysis confirms splicing of the <termsem="SO:0000198"> untranslated exon </term> 1a to <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 1 , with retention of the originally defined start <termsem="SO:0001442"> methionine </term> ( GB : NP_006274 ) ( <termsem="SO:0001060"> Variant </term> A * , lanes 1 and 3 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000147"> Exon </term> 1a also splices to <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 2 , <termsem="SO:0000045"> removing </term> the L-Sm7 binding motif ( <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> I , lanes 3,12 and 13 ) .

In silico modeling of the evolution of TACC protein function .
The protein and <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> structure of the present day TACC family members suggests that the function of the ancestral TACC protein was mediated solely through the interactions of the <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> .
Using an in silico protein-protein interaction model based upon known mitotic spindle and centrosomal components , we have previously predicted a number of additional interactions that could be conserved between a functional TACC <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> in yeast , spc-72 , and one or more human TACC proteins [ 21 ] .
Thus , it is known that all the TACC proteins examined to date interact , via the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , with the microtubule/centrosomal proteins of the stu2/msps/ch-TOG family [ 5,6,22-24 ] , and with the Aurora kinases [ 20,21,25 ] .
These interactions are required for the accumulation of the D-TACC , spc72 , ceTAC1 and TACC3 proteins to the centrosome [ 5,6,22-24 ] .
Hence , this functional interaction with the centrosome and mitotic spindle is likely to represent the ancient , conserved function of the TACC family .
However , it is apparent that the human TACC proteins also differ in their ability to interact with the Aurora kinases .
For instance , TACC1 and TACC3 interact with Aurora A kinase , whereas TACC2 interacts with Aurora C kinase [ 21 ] , suggesting a degree of functional specialization in the derivatives of the ancestral chordate TACC , after the radiation of the vertebrate TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
The localization of the vertebrate TACC proteins in the interphase nucleus [ 15,26,27 ] suggests that they have additional functions outside their ancient role in the centrosome and microtubule dynamics .
Thus , it seems likely that TACC family members in protostomes and deuterostomes have integrated new unique functions as the evolving TACC <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> acquired additional <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> .
The results of the pilot large-scale proteomic analysis in C. elegans and D. melanogaster provide further suggestive evidence to this functional evolution .
Yeast two hybrid analysis indicates that ceTAC directly binds to C. elegans lin15A , lin36 and lin37 [ 28 ] .
These proteins bridge ceTAC to other elements of the cytoskeleton and microtubule network , as well as to components of the ribosome , the histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling machinery such as egr-1 and lin-53 ( the C. elegans <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologues </term> of the human MTA-1 and RbAP48 ) , and to transcription factors such as the PAL1 homeobox and the nuclear hormone receptor nhr-86 [ 28 ] ( Fig. 6A ) .
Similarly , large scale proteomics [ 29 ] has shown that Drosophila TACC interacts with two proteins , the <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> binding protein TBPH and CG14540 ( Fig. 6B ) , and thus indirectly with the Drosophila SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage repair machinery .
Significantly , the ceTAC protein has also recently been implicated in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair through its direct interaction with the C. elegans BARD1 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologue </term> [ 30 ] .
It should be noted that a number of interactions with the TACC proteins from these organisms have probably been missed by these large scale methods , including the well documented direct interactions with the aurora kinases and the stu2/msps/ch-TOG family .

( B ) : Using the BIND database [ 29 ] , DTACC directly binds to TBPH and CG14540 , and thus indirectly to chromatin remodeling complexes ( SWI/SNF and histone acetyltransferases ) , <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage repair machinery ( via RAD23 ) , and <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> splicing , transport and translational machinery .

It is also of interest that this predicts a functional interaction with the LDB family , members of which are also found in TACC containing <termsem="SO:0000854"> <termsem="SO:0000859"> paralogous </term> segments </term> noted in Figs 2 , 3 and Additional file 1 .

?
denotes uncertainty over the identity of a functional vertebrate <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> .
In C , D and E , ' * ' denotes one or more members of the TACC or Aurora kinase family .
Because of the <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionary conservation </term> of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , we would predict that some of the functional interactions seen in C. elegans and D. melanogaster would be observed in higher animals .
Phylogenetic profiling from these interaction maps suggests two similar sets of predicted interactions for vertebrate TACCs ( Fig. 6C and 6D ) .
Strikingly , however , the C. elegans specific proteins lin15A , lin36 and lin37 do not have readily discernible <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologues </term> in vertebrates or Drosophila , although the presence of a zinc finger <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> in lin36 may suggest that this protein is involved directly in transcription or perform an adaptor role similar to LIM containing proteins .
For the DTACC interacting proteins , TBPH corresponds to TDP43 , a protein implicated in transcriptional regulation and splicing [ 31,32 ] .
However , the assignment of the human <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> of CG14540 is less clear , with the closest <termsem="SO:0000343"> matches </term> in the human databases corresponding to <termsem="SO:0001448"> glutamine </term> rich transcription factors such as CREB and the G-box binding factor .
Comparison of modeled with experimentally defined interactions of the vertebrate TACC proteins .
The interaction data for the vertebrate TACCs is relatively limited ; however , interaction networks are now beginning to emerge .
The results of our functional analysis , as well as other published data clearly indicate that the vertebrate TACCs interact with proteins that can be divided into two broad categories : 1 ) proteins with roles in centrosome/mitotic spindle dynamics , and 2 ) proteins involved in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> regulation , either at the level of transcription , or subsequent <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> processing and translation [ 3,5-7,15,19-21,24,25,33,34 ] .
Many of these proteins do not appear to interact directly with the protostome TACCs , but would be expected to be in the same protein complex ( Fig. 6C ,6 D ) .
Significant analysis of the association of the TACCs with the centrosome and the dynamics of mitotic spindle assembly from yeast to humans has been published [ 5,6,21-24 ] .
From this analysis , it seems likely that the vertebrate TACC3 protein has retained this direct ancestral function , based upon its location in these structures during mitosis [ 27 ] , its strong interaction with Aurora Kinase A , and the observation that it is the only human TACC protein phosphorylated by this <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> [ 21 ] .
However , the variability of the central <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of the vertebrate <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> , suggests that TACC3 may also have acquired additional , and in some instances , species-specific functions .
For instance , in X. laevis , the maskin protein has acquired a binding site for the eIF4E protein , and thus a function in the coordinated control of polyadenylation and translation in the Xenopus oocyte [ 8,35 ] .
A recent study has suggested that this function may be unique to maskin : although it is unclear whether the other vertebrate TACC3 proteins interact with the eIF4E/CPEB complex , the human TACC1A <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> is unable to interact with the eIF4E/CPEB complex .
Instead , some TACC1 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> have evolved a related , but distinct function by directly interacting with elements of the <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> splicing and transport machinery [ 19 ] .
To further characterize the evolving functions of the TACC proteins , we have used an unbiased yeast two hybrid screening method to identify proteins that bind to the human TACC proteins [ 3,34 ] .
In a screen of a MATCHMAKER fetal brain library ( BD Biosciences Clontech ) , in addition to isolating the histone acetyltransferase hGCN5L2 [ 34 ] , we also identified the 3 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> of retinoid-X receptor  as a protein that interacts with the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> of TACC2 .
As shown in Fig. 7 , this interaction is confirmed in vitro by GST-pull down analysis .
Significantly , RXR is a close family relative of the nuclear hormone receptor , nhr-86 , from C. elegans , which interacts with the ceTAC binding protein lin36 ( Fig. 6A ) .
This suggests that while protostome TACCs may require additional protein factors to interact with such components , the TACCs in higher organisms may have evolved the ability to directly interact with some of the proteins in the predicted interaction map ( Fig. 6E ) .
Indeed , this appears to be directly linked to the acquisition of new <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> and <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the chordate TACC precursor .
In fact , the first identified function of a vertebrate TACC protein was as a transcriptional coactivator acting through a direct interaction with the ARNT transcription factor [ 7 ] .
It is also intriguing that the deuterostome specific SDP <termsem="SO:0000657"> <termsem="SO:0000726"> repeat </term> </term> interacts with GAS41 , a component/accessory factor of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex [ 3,15 ] .
Although there is a D. melanogaster <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> of GAS41 , dmGAS41 , the large scale proteomic interaction database does not indicate a direct interaction of dmGAS41 with DTACC .
This may be due to the lack of the SDP <termsem="SO:0000657"> repeat region </term> in the Drosophila TACC protein .
This further suggests that the vertebrate TACCs have gained the specific ability to direct interact with transcriptional regulatory complexes , and that bridging protein ( s ) are no longer required .
Thus , where the ceTAC protein is only composed of the TACC <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , the significantly larger TACC family members in higher protostomes and deuterostomes may have integrated one or more functions of the bridging protein ( in this case lin15A , lin36 or lin37 ) .
This may also explain the absence of lin15A , lin36 and lin37 <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologues </term> in higher organisms , as they were no longer under selective evolutionary pressure to remain within the complex , and thus lost in the evolving <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .

Proposed functional evolution of the TACC family .
Examination of the evolution of ancient <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> families provides an insight into how <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> structure relates to function .
We have presented above , a detailed examination of one such <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> family .
The data so far suggest that the functional TACC <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologue </term> in yeast ( spc72 ) has a specific role in centrosomal/mitotic spindle dynamics [ 21,22 ] .
This ancient TACC function is conserved throughout evolution in both protostomes and deuterostomes .
In addition , the TACC proteins of lower organisms appear to interact with bridging proteins that are components of several different protein complexes involved in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage repair , protein translation , <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> processing and transcription .
However , over the process of evolutionary time , with the acquisition of new <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> and <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the chordate TACC precursor , the chordate TACC proteins have acquired the ability to directly interact with some of the other components of these complexes ( such as the LSm proteins , nuclear hormone receptors , GAS41 , accessory proteins and transcription factors ) , and thus evolved additional functions within these complexes .
Indeed , the first assigned function of a vertebrate TACC protein , mouse TACC3 , was as a transcriptional coactivator of the ARNT mediated transcriptional response to hypoxia and polyaromatic hydrocarbons [ 7 ] .
Mouse TACC3 has also been reported to interact with the transcription factor STAT5 [ 33 ] .
Recently , we have demonstrated that TACC2 and TACC3 can bind to nuclear histone acetyltransferases [ 34 ] , further confirming a more direct role for the TACC proteins in transcriptional and chromatin remodeling events .
Interestingly although all human TACC proteins can directly interact with the histone acetyltransferase pCAF in vitro , the TACC1 <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoforms </term> expressed in human breast cancer cells do not interact with this histone acetylase [ 34 ] .
This may be attributable to the proposed function of the <termsem="SO:0000147"> Exon </term> 1 containing TACC1 <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> in <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> processing , via the interaction with LSm-7 and SmG [ 19 ] .
Thus , alternative splicing of the TACC1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> adds further diversity to TACC1 function , as the <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of specific <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> and their associated binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> will change the potential protein complexes with which they can associate , either directly , or by redirecting the <termsem="SO:1001187"> splice variants </term> to different subcellular compartments .
With the <termsem="SO:1000035"> duplication </term> of the TACC1/TACC2 ancestor , it is apparent that an even greater functional diversity may have been introduced into the TACC family .
The TACC2 protein retains the ability of TACC3 to interact with GAS41 , INI1 , histone acetyltransferases and transcription factors ( in this case , RXR ) ( Fig. 7 ) [ 3,34 ] .
However , the tissue specific splicing of the 5 kb <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> in the TACC2l <termsem="SO:0001060"> isoform </term> [ 3 ] indicates that this protein has several temporal and tissue specific functions yet to be identified .

These protein <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> were initially aligned with CLUSTAL X [ 38 ] .
Minor adjustments to certain <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of the alignment for optimization purposes were made based on pairwise alignments , the output saved in PHYLIP format , after which , the distances between proteins were calculated using Poisson correction and the Unrooted trees were inferred with the NJ method and then displayed using TreeView [ 39 ] .
Bootstrap values above 700 for 1000 trials are shown at the node .
To validate the tree , the same <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> set was analyzed with tools in the PHYLIP package [ 40 ] , using PRODIST followed by FITCH or NEIGNBOR and tree displaying using TreeView .
This additional method produced trees with essentially the same topology ( data not shown ) .
In vitro interaction of TACC2 and RXR3 .
The TACC2 <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> was cloned into GST <termsem="SO:0000806"> fusion </term> <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> pGEX5X2 ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) .
GST and GST-TACC2 proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 ( DE3 ) plys `` S '' with 1 mM IPTG at 37 C shaker for 2 hrs .
Cells ( 50 ml ) were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH. 8.0 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA pH8 .0 , Protease inhibitor set III ( Calbiochem ) .
