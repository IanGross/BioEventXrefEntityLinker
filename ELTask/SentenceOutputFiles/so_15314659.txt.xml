Spontaneous Autoimmunity in 129 and C57BL/6 Mice -- Implications for Autoimmunity Described in <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> - Targeted Mice .
Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder in which complex <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> factors play an important role .
Several strains of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice have been reported to develop SLE , implicating the null <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the causation of disease .
However , hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL/6 mice , widely used in the generation of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice , develop spontaneous autoimmunity .
Furthermore , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype of SLE in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice .
This suggests an important role in the expression of autoimmunity of as-yet-uncharacterised background <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> originating from these parental mouse strains .
Using <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide linkage analysis , we identified several susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> , derived from 129 and C57BL/6 mice , mapped in the lupus-prone hybrid ( 129  C57BL/6 ) model .
By creating a C57BL/6 congenic strain carrying a 129-derived <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 segment , we found that this 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> was sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens , which had previously been attributed to a disrupted <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
These results demonstrate important epistatic modifiers of autoimmunity in 129 and C57BL/6 mouse strains , widely used in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting .
These background <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> influences may account for some , or even all , of the autoimmune traits described in some <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted models of SLE .
Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by the production of autoantibodies ( auto-Abs ) against a wide spectrum of self-antigens , mainly from subcellular compartments , especially the cell nucleus .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genetic </term> predisposition is an important contributor to susceptibility to SLE in both humans and animals ( Vyse and Todd 1996 ; Harley et al. 1998 ; Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999 ; Wakeland et al. 2001 ) .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Genes </term> in multiple pathways participate in mediating disease pathogenesis , and epistatic interactions amongst these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> influence the expression of disease .
In this context , both <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> linkage studies in spontaneous lupus-prone models and synthetic murine models of autoimmunity generated by targeted disruption of specific <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> modulating the immune system have widely been used to investigate the complexity of SLE .
The best-studied strains of mice that spontaneously develop a lupus-like pathology are the New Zealand Black/New Zealand White hybrid strain ( NZB/WF1 ) ; the MRL/Mp lpr/lpr strain , which carries the lpr <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> of the FAS receptor <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ; and the BXSB strain , which carries the Y <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> autoimmune accelerator ( Yaa ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Theofilopoulos and Dixon 1985 ) .
Extensive <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> mapping studies in all three strains have identified multiple <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> associated with disease susceptibility .
Interestingly , the majority of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> detected are strain-specific , confirming the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> complexity of the disease and indicating the presence of extensive heterogeneity in the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease .
However , some susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> have been mapped to similar <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> locations </term> in different strains , suggesting that at least some susceptibility may be shared amongst lupus-prone strains .
Amongst these shared susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> , the most striking are loci on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 , for which important contributing <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> have been found in New Zealand and BXSB models ( Theofilopoulos and Kono 1999 ; Wakeland et al. 2001 ) .
Although considerable efforts have been made to identify the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> responsible for the development of the disease , with the exception of the lpr <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> , none of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> contributions to disease in the three well-documented murine SLE strains have yet been fully resolved at the molecular or protein level .
Thus , targeted <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> disruption of candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding proteins of the immune system has been extensively used to examine their role in immune regulation .
However , the most surprising result of this powerful approach has been the high frequency with which such <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> have been associated with an autoimmune phenotype .
In this regard , it is of note that hybrid strains between 129 and C57BL/6 mice , widely used in the generation of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice , are spontaneously predisposed to development of humoral autoimmunity with low levels of glomerulonephritis ( Obata et al. 1979 ; Botto et al. 1998 ; Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ) .
Furthermore , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background markedly influences the autoimmune phenotype in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ; Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
These observations led to the hypothesis that the autoimmune phenotype described in some <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice might be due primarily to combinations of as-yet-uncharacterised background <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , originating from 129 and C57BL/6 mice strains , interacting or not with the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
To test this , we conducted a <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide scan analysis of two large cohorts of ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 mice , one of which carried a <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the serum amyloid P component <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Apcs ) .
The Apcs-deficient mice ( Apcs  /  ) were chosen as an example of a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted strain previously reported to develop a lupus-like disease on the hybrid <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background ( 129  C57BL/6 ) ; autoimmunity in Apcs  /  mice persists even after backcrossing the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> onto C57BL/6 ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) .
We chose this targeted <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in particular to study since the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is located on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 , approximately 94 cM from the <termsem="SO:0000577"> centromere </term> , within a <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> where several lupus-susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> , designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001 ) , Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995 ; Vyse et al. 1997 ) , and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998 ; Haywood et al. 2000 ) , have been mapped in NZW , NZB , and BXSB lupus-prone strains , respectively .
This <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> contains several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , including those encoding FcRII , the complement receptor CR1/2 ( CD35/CD21 ) , and the decay-accelerating factor CD55 ( Prodeus et al. 1998 ; Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Miwa et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) , which have each been implicated in the causation of SLE when inactivated by <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells .
Here we show that there are multiple <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> , derived from both 129 and C57BL/6 mice , contributing to autoimmunity .
Furthermore , a 129-derived interval on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 , when <termsem="SO:0000049"> transferred </term> onto the C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> that has been inactivated in 129 embryonic stem cells , was sufficient to cause humoral autoimmunity in its own right , irrespective of the presence of the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
These results demonstrate important epistatic interactions between <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> from 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomes </term> on the development of autoimmunity and illustrate the important effects of background <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the analysis and interpretation of autoimmune phenotypes associated with targeted <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> disruptions .
Disease Traits in ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 and ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  Mice .
To investigate the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> basis of the lupus-like disease observed in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid mice , we generated two large cohorts of ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 animals , one carrying a <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> in the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , and monitored them for 1 y under identical environmental conditions .
Since female mice in the original reports showed a higher penetrance of disease , the present study was conducted only on female mice .
The results of the phenotypic analysis at 1 y of age are summarised in Tables 1 and 2 .
As previously reported ( Botto et al. 1998 ) , the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 mice developed lupus traits with elevated levels of auto-Abs , starting from 6 mo of age ( data not shown ) , and histological evidence of proliferative glomerulonephritis .
In agreement with our previous observations ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) , the titres of anti-nuclear Abs ( ANAs ) and anti-chromatin Ab were considerably greater in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  mice compared with the strain-matched controls .
However , in contrast to our original findings , the levels of the other two disease serological markers analysed ( anti- <termsem="SO:0000984"> single - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> [ ssDNA ] and anti- <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> [ dsDNA ] Abs ) and the severity of the renal pathology were not different between the two experimental groups .
In view of the possibility of an association between the fixed 129-derived <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> flanking the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> and the autoimmune traits observed , the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide linkage analysis of the two experimental cohorts was carried out separately .
Mapping of <termsem="SO:0000001"> Loci </term> Predisposing to Lupus in the Hybrid Strain ( 129  C57BL/6 ) .
Mice were genotyped with 143 <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellite markers </term> distributed throughout the autosomes such that 98 % of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were within 20 cM of an informative marker .
A summary of the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide linkage analysis for each of the disease traits measured is shown in Table 3 .
The <termsem="SO:0000018"> areas of linkage </term> were defined according to the parental origin , 129 or C57BL/6 .
Only linkages identified in both experimental groups are reported in Table 3 , with the exception of the <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 distal segment , where the linkage analysis could not be applied to the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  mice as this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> was of fixed 129 origin .
<termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosomes </term> where linkages were present only in one of the two cohorts are shown in Figures 1 -- 3 .
The <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait linkage </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ) analysis identified several <termsem="SO:0000830"> intervals on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 with linkage to disease serological markers , and these <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> were all derived from the 129 mouse strain ( see Table 3 ; Figures 4 and 5 ) .
Interestingly , whilst ANA and anti-chromatin Ab levels showed suggestive or significant linkages only to the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric region of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 , with an estimated peak occurring at a <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> approximately 90 cM near the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , anti-dsDNA or anti-ssDNA Ab production was also linked to other <termsem="SO:0000830"> segments on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 , indicating a more complex <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> contribution from the 129 mouse strain .
Guided by these observations , we investigated whether the increased levels of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab observed in the Apcs  /  mice were caused by a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene ( s ) </term> within the fixed 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> surrounding the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , rather than caused by the <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> itself .
We compared the levels of these auto-Abs between all ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  mice and a group of 33 <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice that were selected for being homozygous 129 in the <termsem="SO:0000830"> region of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 between <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellites </term> D1Mit105 and D1Mit 223 ( 80 -- 106 cM ) ( Figure 6A -- 6D ) .
In contrast to the results reported in Table 1 , this comparison showed no significant differences between the two experimental groups .
This result demonstrates that , most likely , the 129-derived <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> and not the lack of Apcs was mediating the production of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab .
Consistent with this explanation , we found that the 129 mice have significantly higher levels of Apcs in circulation compared with the C57BL/6 mice ( median , 83 mg/l ; range , 25 -- 208 ; n = 16 versus median , 5 mg/l ; range , 4 -- 9 ; n = 10 , respectively ; p < 0.0001 ) .
The C57BL/6 strain has previously been reported to be one of the murine strains defined as low Apcs producers ( Pepys et al. 1979 ; Baltz et al. 1980 ) .
In addition , <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> analysis of the entire Apcs <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> in both strains failed to identify any <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> in the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( data not shown ) , indicating that a structural <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> of the protein is unlikely to be the explanation for our findings .
This is consistent with a previous report by Drake et al. ( 1996 ) that showed no Apcs <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> differences amongst several autoimmune and nonautoimmune murine strains .
In addition to the 129-derived <termsem="SO:0000001"> segments </term> , in both cohorts the C57BL/6 strain contributed to the autoimmune traits with one major susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000830"> locus on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 3 .
A <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> region </term> between D3Mit40 and D3Mit13 , with an estimated peak at <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> approximately 51 cM , showed a significant linkage to ANA production and weaker linkages to anti-ssDNA and anti-chromatin production ( see Table 3 ; Figure 7 ) .
The high frequency of autoimmune phenotype in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background and its absence in either of the inbred parental strains imply that there are essential interactions between 129 - and C57BL/6-derived <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> for the expression of autoimmunity .
We investigated further the effects of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> from the C57BL/6 background by repeating the linkage analysis in ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 mice , whilst controlling for the very strong 129 effect on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 , as previously described ( Zeng 1994 ) .
The results of this analysis showed that the statistical support for the linkage of the C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000830"> locus on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 3 for ANA increased from logarithm of odds ( LOD ) 5.4 to LOD 6.4 .
In contrast to these strong associations with disease serological markers , the <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> analysis identified only two potential linkages to glomerulonephritis : one in the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> mice on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 7 across a 10 cM <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> between D7Mit246 ( 15 cM ) and D7Mit145 ( 26.5 cM ) of 129 origin ( LOD 2.86 , p = 0.0013 ) , and one on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 17 between D17Mit100 ( 11.7 cM ) and D17Mit216 ( 29.4 cM ) from the C57BL/6 strain ( LOD 1.3 , p = 0.049 and LOD 1.67 , p = 0.021 in the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> and Apcs  /  mice , respectively ) .
Histological evidence of glomerulonephritis was only found in approximately 20 % of the mice in each cohort , which reduces the power of the <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> analysis for this disease trait .
Production of a C57BL/6 .129 <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 Congenic Line and Its Phenotypic Analysis .
We generated a C57BL/6 congenic line carrying the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric region of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 from the 129 mouse strain , in order to dissect the complex polygenic disease phenotype of the ( C57BL/6  129/Sv ) F2 hybrid strain into its individual <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> components .
The 129 interval was backcrossed seven times onto C57BL/6 , and at each generation the presence or absence of the <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 interval was determined with several <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellite markers </term> .
Each backcrossed generation was screened with more than three markers per <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> to facilitate the <termsem="SO:0000045"> removal </term> of unselected 129 <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> regions </term> .
At the end of the backcrossing , the 129-derived <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 interval in the congenic mice extended from <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellite marker </term> D1Mit105 to D1Mit223 ( 80 -- 106 cM ) , which encompasses the most important 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> identified by the linkage studies in the ( C57BL/6  129/Sv ) F2 mice .
Female <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 congenic mice ( C57BL/6 .129 [ D1Mit105 -- 223 ] ) , together with sex-matched Apcs  /  mice backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations ( C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  ) and C57BL/6 controls , were monitored for the presence of lupus .
In the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  mice , the 129 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> around the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> was mapped as a <termsem="SO:0000001"> stretch </term> of approximately 17 cM , positioned from 87.9 cM ( D1Mit15 ) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17 ) .
Thus , the congenic line carried a similar 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> ( 80 -- 106 cM ) to the one present in the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  mice ( 87.9 -- 105 cM ) .
At 1 y of age , all animals were sacrificed , the auto-Abs assessed , and the renal histology examined .
The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 8 .
As previously reported ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) , the levels of auto-Abs were markedly increased in the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  compared to the <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> C57BL/6 controls .
However , the C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) animals also expressed high levels of auto-Abs , and these titres were not different from those detected in the matched congenic mice containing a null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> of the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
These results clearly demonstrated that epistatic interactions between 129 <termsem="SO:0000830"> loci on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 and C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were sufficient to mediate the loss of tolerance to nuclear autoantigens .
However , in contrast to the serological data , the histological assessment of the kidneys showed evidence of markedly increased glomerulonephritis in the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  compared to both control groups ( Figure 9 ) , suggesting that the lack of Apcs , when combined with other C57BL/6 susceptibility <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , can induce the development of severe renal damage .
There is accumulating evidence that background <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> may influence the expression of autoimmunity in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice .
Here we report what is to our knowledge the first systematic study that has examined this in the 129 and C57BL/6 mouse strains , widely used for <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting .
Our results demonstrate interacting <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> between 129 and C57BL/6 mice that can cause the expression of a powerful autoimmune phenotype in these animals , in the absence of any <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
We also developed a congenic mouse strain bearing a portion of 129 <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 on a C57BL/6 background and showed that this <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> congenic line expressed striking anti-nuclear autoimmunity .
By comparing this <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 congenic strain with matched congenic mice lacking the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , we demonstrated that serum amyloid P component deficiency influences the severity of glomerulonephritis , but is not the prime mover in the induction of anti-nuclear autoimmunity , contrary to our own original interpretation of our data ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) .
The same consideration applies to other <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> located in the same <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 region that have been implicated in the development of SLE when inactivated by <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeting in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed onto a pure <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Miwa et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) .
For each , there has to be a question as to whether the anti-nuclear autoimmunity is due to the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutant </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> or to the normal 129 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> expressed in the same <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> as the targeted <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
The influence of background <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> on the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease is well known , especially with respect to the lpr and Yaa disease-susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
In MRL/Mp mice , the presence of the lpr <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> accelerates the development of high level and broad-spectrum auto-Ab production and lethal glomerulonephritis , in addition to marked lymphoproliferative disease .
In contrast , homozygosity of the lpr <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in other strains such as C57BL/6 , AKR , LG/J , and C3H leads only to auto-Ab production ( Izui et al. 1984 ) .
Similarly , the Y - <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> - linked Yaa <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in BXSB and MRL/Mp males enhances the rapid development of auto-Abs and glomerulonephritis ( Izui et al. 1988 ; Merino et al. 1989 ) .
However , in the C57BL/6 background , the Yaa <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> does not lead to an autoimmune phenotype ( Izui et al. 1988 ) .
Not surprisingly , important effects of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background on the expression of autoimmunity have also been reported in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ; Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
Thus , SLE exists as a complex-trait disorder in which specific combinations of susceptibility <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are required for the expression of the full phenotype .
Through the use of <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellite marker </term> maps , the identification of murine SLE susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> in experimental crosses has been made possible .
These mapping studies have shown that the disease expression in relation to the inheritance of the different <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> followed a threshold liability pattern in which a positive phenotype depended upon the presence of multiple discrete susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> with no single <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> being a prerequisite factor .
We have employed the same approach to analyse the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> basis of disease inheritance in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid strain , the most common <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background in <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted mice .
Although spontaneous autoimmunity has not been documented in either of the pure 129 or C57BL/6 strains , a spontaneous lupus-like phenotype has been described in ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid strains ( Obata et al. 1979 ; Botto et al. 1998 ; Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ; Santiago-Raber et al. 2001 ) , suggesting that the predisposition in these hybrid mice may arise as a result of the interaction between specific combinations of <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> inherited from both the 129 and C57BL/6 parental strains .
This was confirmed by the mapping study reported here .
We showed that there are multiple <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> contributing to the disease and these are derived from both 129 and C57BL/6 mice .
We demonstrated that a 129-derived <termsem="SO:0000830"> segment of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 was strongly linked to the expression of auto-Abs .
This <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> is probably capable of causing the initiation of a humoral autoimmune response to nuclear antigens ; however , this response does not occur in the absence of C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
In support of this , we identified a C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000830"> segment on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 3 , which may interact with the 129 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 to mediate the loss of tolerance .
Interestingly , although the C57BL/6 SLE-susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000830"> region on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 3 is novel , disease-modifying <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> derived from C57BL/10 and C57BL/6 strains have been mapped to a <termsem="SO:0000830"> portion of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 3 close to the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> identified in this study ( Morel et al. 1999 ; Haywood et al. 2000 ) .
Furthermore , the <termsem="SO:0000830"> region on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 7 associated with the development of lupus nephritis has been linked to the same trait in other murine models of SLE ( Santiago et al. 1998 ; Morel et al. 1999 ; Xie et al. 2002 ) , suggesting the possibility of shared susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> .
Taken together our results suggest a complex <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> contribution from the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) hybrid background <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , with both enhancing as well as inhibitory <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> from the 129 mouse , in addition to <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> promoting autoimmunity from the C57BL/6 mice .
The impact that these interacting <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> may have on the lupus-like disease present in several <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted animals was further assessed by comparing Apcs  /  mice with <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> matched controls .
In the context of SLE susceptibility , one of the most consistently mapped non-MHC <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of the mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> is the telomeric <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 segment , where several disease <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> , designated Sle1 ( Morel et al. 2001 ) , Nba2 ( Drake et al. 1995 ; Rozzo et al. 1996 ; Vyse et al. 1997 ) , and Bxs3 ( Hogarth et al. 1998 ) , have been mapped in lupus-prone strains .
Moreover , this region of mouse <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 is <termsem="SO:0000858"> orthologous </term> to a region on human <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1q22 -- 1q25 , which has also been linked with human SLE ( Moser et al. 1998 ) .
The Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> is one of the candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> known to lie within this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
The human serum amyloid P component binds avidly to <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> , chromatin , and apoptotic cells in physiological conditions in vitro ( Pepys 1974 ; Pepys and Butler 1987 ; Butler et al. 1990 ) and also to exposed chromatin and apoptotic cells in vivo ( Hintner et al. 1988 ; Breathnach et al. 1989 ; Familian et al. 2001 ) .
We have previously reported that ( 129  C57BL/6 ) .
Apcs  /  mice spontaneously produce a wide range of ANAs and develop significant immune complex glomerulonephritis ( Bickerstaff et al. 1999 ) .
On the basis of these observations , it was postulated that Apcs , by altering the clearance of chromatin , contributes to the pathogenesis of SLE .
However , in this study we found that only ANA and anti-chromatin Ab levels were significantly increased in the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  mice .
A possible explanation for this discrepancy may lie in the fact that the Apcs  /  mice analysed in the original study were generated from a limited number of founders and that this may have caused a nonrandom inheritance of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> from the parental strains .
Furthermore , the whole - <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> analysis identified the 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> surrounding the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> as the main <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> contributing to the development of ANA and anti-chromatin Ab .
In agreement with this , when we carried out a selective comparison between the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  mice and <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> matched controls , we failed to detect any significant difference in the levels of these two auto-Abs .
These findings , taken together , indicated that the phenotype associated with Apcs deficiency was caused by the presence of unaltered 129 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> from the <termsem="SO:0000624"> telomeric region of <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 operating in the C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> background .
Strong supportive evidence for this was provided by the analysis of the C57BL/6 mice congenic for this 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
The generation and analysis of congenic strains have successfully been used to dissect the contribution of individual susceptibility <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> to a multigenic trait such as SLE .
We adopted the same strategy to investigate the relative contribution of the 129 <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 segment and the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> to each disease trait .
Using this approach , we demonstrated that the 129 interval on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 , when <termsem="SO:0000049"> transferred </term> onto the C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> , a combination commonly created by backcrossing onto C57BL/6 a <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutated </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> located in that <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> region </term> , was sufficient to mediate the production of auto-Abs .
In this context , it is of note that several strains of mice with targeted <termsem="SO:0000041"> <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> </term> of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoded in this <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> have been reported to express a lupus-like illness , including mice lacking FcRIIB ( Bolland and Ravetch 2000 ) , complement receptors ( CR1/2 ) ( Prodeus et al. 1998 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) , and decay-accelerating factor ( CD55 ) ( Miwa et al. 2002 ) .
In each case , the autoimmune phenotype was described in mice in which the null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutation </term> was generated in 129 embryonic stem cells and then backcrossed to the C57BL/6 or another <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background .
Thus , in view of our findings , one may postulate that in each of these murine models of SLE , the effects of the targeted null <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> were irrelevant .
Similar conclusions may apply to other <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - targeted animals carrying <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> mapped in the 129-derived susceptibility <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 7 ( O'Keefe et al. 1996 , 1999 ) .
The expression of anti-nuclear autoimmunity was identical comparing the congenic with the Apcs  /  mice .
The only difference in phenotype between these mice was in the expression of glomerulonephritis , which was more pronounced in the Apcs  /  mice compared with the congenic mice .
Although these findings demonstrate that Apcs is not implicated in the processing of autoantigens , as it had previously been suggested , they indicate that Apcs might still play an important protective role in lupus nephritis .
In support of this , the expression of the human C-reactive protein , an acute-phase protein closely related to Apcs , has been shown to delay the onset and severity of lupus nephritis in the NZB/W strain by preventing the deposition of immune complexes in the renal cortex ( Szalai et al. 2003 ) .
Consistent with this , a <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> associated with reduced basal level of C-reactive protein has been reported to be linked to SLE in humans ( Russell et al. 2004 ) .
However , as the congenic mice and the Apcs  /  mice carried similar but not identical 129 <termsem="SO:0000830"> regions on <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> </term> 1 , an alternative explanation for our findings may still lay in the numerous and complex synergistic and counteractive interactions between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in self-tolerance and end organ damage .
Thus , whilst the lack of lupus nephritis in the congenic mice is consistent with the need for multiple susceptibility <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for the full expression of lupus , further studies will be required to fully elucidate the role of Apcs in the pathogenesis of renal damage .
In summary , our findings demonstrate the impact of epistatic interactions between 129 and C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomes </term> on the development of SLE and illustrate how these background <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> effects may lead to incorrect interpretations when analysing the autoimmune phenotype of specific <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> disruptions .
Mice .
All the mice were females .
<termsem="SO:0000817"> Wild-type </term> C57BL/6 and 129/Sv ( 129S6 , according to the revised nomenclature ) were bred and maintained in the animal care facility at Imperial College , London , United Kingdom .
( 129  C57BL/6 ) F1 mice were generated by intercrossing the two <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> strains and ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 mice by interbreeding the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F1 mice .
The Apcs  /  mice were generated as previously reported ( Botto et al. 1997 ) , and the ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  mice were generated by intercrossing Apcs  /  mice on the 129 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> background with Apcs  /  animals backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations .
A total of 141 ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2 and 158 ( 129  C57BL/6 ) F2.Apcs  /  female mice were produced and monitored for 1 y. <termsem="SO:0000817"> Wild-type </term> congenic C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) mice were generated by backcrossing the 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> between <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellites </term> D1Mit105 and D1Mit223 ( 80 cM to 106 cM ) onto the C57BL/6 strain .
Inherited 129 <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> were mapped with <termsem="SO:0000289"> microsatellite markers </term> <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphic </term> </term> between 129 and C57BL/6 mice ( see below ) .
After seven generations of backcrossing , siblings were intercrossed to generate C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) congenic mice homozygous for the 129 <termsem="SO:0000340"> Chromosome </term> 1 interval .
Inside 129 markers at <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> 81.6 cM ( D1Mit159 ) and 105 cM ( D1Mit17 ) , respectively , and an outside C57BL/6 marker at <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> 74.3 cM ( D1Mit159 ) were used to further define the <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> .
In the C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  mice ( backcrossed onto C57BL/6 for ten generations ) , the 129 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> around the Apcs <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> was mapped as a <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> from 87.9 cM ( D1Mit15 ) to 105 cM ( D1Mit17 ) .
In this analysis , the inside 129 markers were at <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> 93 cM ( D1Mit36 ) and 99.7 cM ( D1Mit115 ) and the outside C57BL/6 markers at <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> 81.6 cM ( D1Mit159 ) and 106 cM ( D1Mit223 ) .
Along with 28 C57BL/6 .
Apcs  /  mice and 30 C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> animals , 26 C57BL/6 .129 ( D1Mit105 -- 223 ) female mice  /  were followed up to 1 y of age .
Animals were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions .
All animal procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines .
Serological analyses .
Sera , collected at 6 and 12 mo of age , were assayed for the presence of auto-Abs .
Levels of IgG ANA were sought by indirect immunofluorescence using Hep-2 cells , and anti-dsDNA Abs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence on Crithidia luciliae as previously described ( Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
Serum samples were screened at a 1:80 ( ANA ) or 1:20 ( anti-dsDNA ) dilution and the positive samples titrated to endpoint .
Abs to ssDNA and anti-chromatin were measured by ELISA , as previously described ( Mitchell et al. 2002 ) .
Samples were screened at a 1:100 dilution , and the results were expressed in arbitrary ELISA units ( AEUs ) relative to a standard positive sample ( derived from an MRL/Mp .
lpr/lpr mouse ) , which was assigned a value of 100 .
For interplate comparison , serial dilutions of a positive control serum sample were included on each plate .
Apcs levels were assessed by ELISA using sheep anti-mouse Apcs and rabbit anti-mouse Apcs Abs ( Calbiochem , Nottigham , United Kingdom ) .
Samples were screened at a 1:3,000 dilution , and the results were expressed in milligrams per liters , referring to a standard curve derived from an acute-phase serum with a known concentration of Apcs ( Calbiochem ) .
Apcs  /  mouse serum was included as a negative control .
Histological analysis .
All the mice , except the few that died before the end of the experiment , were sacrificed at 1 y of age , and kidney portions were fixed in Bouin 's solution and paraffin embedded , and sections were stained with periodic acid -- Schiff reagent .
Glomerular histology was graded in a blinded fashion as follows : grade 0 , normal ; grade 1 , hypercellularity involving greater than 50 % of the glomerular tuft in 25 % -- 50 % of glomeruli ; grade 2 , hypercellularity involving greater than 50 % of the glomerular tuft in 50 % -- 75 % of glomeruli ; grade 3 , glomerular hypercellularity in greater than 75 % of glomeruli or crescents in greater than 25 % of glomeruli .
Non-parametric data are expressed as median with range of values in parentheses .
All statistics were calculated using GraphPad PrismTM version 3.0 for Windows ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , California , United States ) .
Non-parametric tests were applied throughout , with differences being considered significant for p values < 0.05 .
The Mann -- Whitney test was used for comparison of two groups , whilst for analysis of three groups the Kruskal -- Wallis test with Dunn 's multiple comparison test was used .
Genotyping was carried out by PCR of <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> using 143 <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphic </term> </term> markers ( list available on request ) distributed throughout all 19 autosomes .
PCRs were performed using standard reagents containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 M <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000289"> Microsatellite markers </term> were screened for size <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> between 129 and C57BL/6 mice .
Only <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> with differences detectable on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels or on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used .
The <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> program MAPMANAGER .
<termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ( ftp://mcbio.med.buffalo.edu/pub/MapMgr/ ) was used , and the two experimental groups were examined independently .
Only data from mice at 12 mo of age were analysed .
Log transformations of auto-Abs levels resulted in more normalised distribution and were used in <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> mapping .
LOD thresholds for suggestive and significant linkages were determined by using a cohort - and trait-specific permutation test ( 1,000 permutations ) .
The average threshold for suggestive , significant , and highly significant linkages were LOD  2.1 ( p  7.8  10  3 ) , LOD  3.6 ( p  2.4  10  4 ) , and LOD  5 ( p  1  10  5 ) , respectively ( Manly and Olson 1999 ) .
