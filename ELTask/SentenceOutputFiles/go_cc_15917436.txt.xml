DNA binding and helicase actions of mouse MCM4/6/7 helicase .
Helicases play central roles in initiation and elongation of DNA replication .
We previously reported that helicase and ATPase activities of the mammalian Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> are activated specifically by thymine-rich single-stranded DNA .
Here , we examined its substrate preference and helicase actions using various synthetic DNAs .
On a bubble substrate , Mcm4/6/7 makes symmetric dual contacts with the 5  - proximal 25 nt single-stranded segments adjacent to the branch points , presumably generating double hexamers .
Loss of thymine residues from one single-strand results in significant decrease of unwinding efficacy , suggesting that concurrent bidirectional unwinding by a single double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 may play a role in efficient unwinding of the bubble .
Mcm4/6/7 binds and unwinds various <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> and extension structures carrying a single-stranded 3  - tail DNA .
The extent of helicase activation depends on the sequence context of the 3  - tail , and the maximum level is achieved by DNA with 50 % or more thymine content .
Strand displacement by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited , as the GC content of the duplex region increases .
Replacement of cytosine -- guanine pairs with cytosine -- inosine pairs in the duplex restored unwinding , suggesting that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 helicase has difficulties in unwinding stably base-paired duplex .
Taken together , these findings reveal important features on activation and substrate preference of the eukaryotic replicative helicase .
DNA helicases couple the hydrolysis of nucleotide or deoxynucleotide triphosphate to duplex unwinding ( 1 ) .
Coordination of a set of subactivities including nucleotide binding , DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis is required for unwinding of duplex DNA ( 1,2 ) .
The hexameric helicases , to which minichromosome maintenance ( Mcm ) helicase belongs , are known to assemble a ring-like structure ( 3 -- 5 ) .
Whereas most of DNA helicases of this group , including simian virus 40 large T-antigen ( 6 ) , Escherichia coli DnaB ( 7 ) and Archaeal Mcm ( 4,8,9 ) , are composed of a single subunit , the active eukaryotic <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicases </term> are composed of two trimeric Mcm4/6/7 proteins ( 10 -- 14 ) .
All the six <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> 2 -- 7 proteins contain highly conserved DNA-dependent ATPase motifs in their central regions ( 15,16 ) .
Among the several stable subcomplexes which <termsem="GO:0042555"> MCM </term> proteins can generate , only the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> has been shown to possess an intrinsic DNA helicase activity ( 10 -- 14,17 -- 18 ) .
While Mcm4 , Mcm6 and Mcm7 proteins make distinct contribution to its helicase activity ( 11 -- 13 ) , Mcm2 or Mcm3/5 inhibit the helicase activity of the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> by converting its double trimer structure into a heterotetramer or heteropentamer , respectively ( 3,11 ) .
<termsem="GO:0000785"> Chromatin </term> immunoprecipitation assays and genetic characterization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strongly suggested that <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> is involved not only in initiation but also in the DNA chain elongation stage as a replicative helicase ( 19,20 ) .
Consistent with this notion , the processivity of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and mouse Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complexes </term> is significantly stimulated on <termsem="GO:0005657"> forked </term> DNA structures and it can unwind duplex DNA of 400 -- 500 bp ( 13,14 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 binds to fork and bubble structures in an ATP-dependent manner , and generates a double-hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> , as was shown for T-antigen ( 13,14,21 ) .
Recently , we reported that the helicase and ATP hydrolysis activities of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 are specifically activated by single-stranded DNA containing stretches of thymine residues and proposed a novel model that <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> may play a crucial role in selection of replication origins in higher eukaryotes ( 13 ) .
In this report , in order to clarify the mode of action of the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> and obtain insight into how it may function at the <termsem="GO:0005657"> replication forks </term> in vivo , we have conducted detailed analyses of helicase action and DNA binding of mouse Mcm4/6/7 helicase using various <termsem="GO:0005657"> forked </term> and bubble substrate DNAs .
We specifically addressed sequence requirement for the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> activation , mode of interaction with DNA substrates and whether the thymine sequences are required for continuous activation of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> during the unwinding process .
The results indicate that mammalian Mcm4/6/7 primarily binds to single-stranded DNA region , and that the extent of helicase activation is related to the thymine content of the single-stranded segment .
Unexpectedly , Mcm4/6/7 helicase is not capable of efficiently unwinding the GC-rich duplex segment , suggesting that some other mechanism may be required for completion of replication of the entire genome .

Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> primarily interacts with the single-stranded DNA segment .
Mcm4/6/7 binds to ` bubble ' DNA substrates and unwinds the duplex segments when the central single-stranded segment contains thymine stretches ( 13 ) .
In order to examine the mode of binding of Mcm4/6/7 on bubble DNAs , we conducted nuclease protection assays using labeled bubble substrate DNAs and Mcm4/6/7 in the presence of ATP--S which permits binding to substrate DNA but does not mobilize the helicase .
At an optimum concentration of DNase I , strong cleavages were detected on the 21 bp duplex regions at both ends of the substrates , whereas weaker cleavages were detected on the central single-stranded region , consistent with preference of DNase I to double-stranded DNA .
With the Bub66/T-rich substrate , strong protection was detected on the entire single-stranded regions of both top and bottom strands with increasing concentration of Mcm4/6/7 , consistent with high affinity of Mcm4/6/7 to T-rich bubble sequences ( Figure 1A ) .
Similar , but less significant protection was detected on the single-stranded DNA segment with P1 nucleases ( Figure 1A ) , which is specific to single-stranded DNA .
The results indicate that the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm complex </term> is loaded onto bubble DNA through binding to both strands of the single-stranded region .
Careful examination of Mcm4/6/7 footprints on a bubble indicated strong protection on the 5  - half of the top strand and moderate protection on the remaining 3  - half , as well as on several base-pair duplex segment adjacent to the branch point ( Figure 1A and data not shown ) .
A similar pattern of protection was observed also on the bottom strand .
This suggests that Mcm4/6/7 may bind to a replication bubble substrate with a 2-fold symmetry as a double hexamer ( Figure 1A , see the lower scheme ) , in a manner similar to SV40 T-antigen ( 21 ) .
Nuclease protection assays were conducted also on a T-tailed Y-fork structure ( Figure 1B ) .
Not only the single-stranded tail region but also the 7 bp duplex DNA adjacent to the duplex-to-single-strand junction were protected by <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> binding from DNaseI digestion .
These results indicate that Mcm4/6/7 protein primarily interacts with single-stranded DNA region and that the interaction also spans the duplex segments near the branchpoint of the <termsem="GO:0005657"> replication fork </term> .
Formation of double hexameric Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complexes </term> facilitates helicase actions on bubble substrates .
The above results suggest that Mcm4/6/7 generates a double hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> on a bubble , each hexamer of which makes symmetric contact with the 5  - proximal central single-stranded segment .
This predicts that the single-stranded segment needs to be of a sufficient length in order to accommodate the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm complex </term> .
In fact , we previously showed that the Mcm4/6/7 mainly forms a single hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> on bubble-20 ( a bubble substrate with 20 nt long central single-stranded segment ) and a double hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> on bubble-60 DNA ( 13 ) .
In order to determine the minimum requirement for double-hexamer formation , a set of synthetic bubble-like substrates ( Bub-T10 , Bub-T20 , Bub-T30 , Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 ) that differed in the length of the central unpaired segment were constructed , and the binding and helicase activities of Mcm4/6/7 on these substrates were examined .
Mcm4/6/7 was incubated with a radiolabeled synthetic bubble substrate in the presence of 0.5 mM ATP--S to allow <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> formation .
A half of these reaction mixtures were analyzed for DNA binding in gel shift assays ( Figure 2A ) , and the remainder was further incubated in the presence of 10 mM ATP to measure DNA helicase activity ( Figure 2B ) .
Bub-10 generated only a low level of <termsem="GO:0032991"> complexes </term> with Mcm4/6/7 , and Bub-20 generated primarily a single mobility-shifted form , which may contain a single hexamer of Mcm4/6/7 .
On Bub-30 , significant amount of <termsem="GO:0032991"> complexes </term> containing a double hexamer were generated in addition to those containing a single hexamer ( Figure 2A ) ( 13,21 ) .
The amounts of double hexamer <termsem="GO:0032991"> complexes </term> increased on Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 with concomitant decrease of single hexamer <termsem="GO:0032991"> complexes </term> ( Figure 2A ) .
The results indicate that a single-stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient loading of the double-hexameric <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> on a bubble substrate .
In DNA helicase assays , Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> did not show helicase activity on either Bub-10 or Bub-20 substrate .
The efficiency of displacement slightly improved as the length of the single-stranded segment increased up to 30 nt .
On Bub-T40 and Bub-T50 , on the other hand , significant displacement was observed , indicating that a single-stranded segment of at least 40 nt long is required for efficient helicase actions on bubble substrates ( Figure 2B ) .
Taken together , the above results are consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> , loaded onto DNA as a double hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> , efficiently unwinds the duplex region of the substrate DNA .
Both strands of thymine-rich single-stranded segments are required for efficient unwinding of bubble DNA by Mcm4/6/7 .
Symmetric binding of the Mcm4/6/7 double hexamer to bubble suggests that each hexamer catalyzes unwinding of one of the two duplex segments .
We asked whether activation of both hexamers is required for unwinding of the bubble substrate .
The preferred bubble substrate which is efficiently unwound by Mcm4/6/7 contains thymine stretches on both strands of the single-stranded segment .
We constructed a hetero-bubble ( Bub66/T -- G-rich ) in which one strand is T-rich ( same as Bub66/T-rich ) and the other strand is G-rich ( same as Bub66/G-rich ) ( 13 ) , and helicase assays were conducted with increasing amount of Mcm4/6/7 .
Only weak unwinding was detected on this substrate compared to Bub66/T-rich ( Figure 3A ) .
Since Mcm4/6/7 can bind to Bub66/T -- G-rich and forms a double hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> ( data not shown ) , the defective unwinding is not due to inefficient loading of the helicase onto the substrate .
If one hexamer interacting with the thymine-rich strand dissociates from the other hexamer and displaces only one of the duplex segments , then it would result in generation of Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork structures </term> which could not be further displaced due to the presence of G-rich 3  - tail and would appear on the gel .
However , we did not detect such intermediates during the course of the experiment ( Figure 3B ) , suggesting that bubble can be displaced efficiently only when two molecules of the Mcm4/6/7 hexamers are simultaneously activated .
Binding and helicase actions of Mcm4/6/7 on <termsem="GO:0005657"> forked </term> and 3  - or 5  - extension substrates .
In order to examine more precisely the interaction and helicase actions with <termsem="GO:0005657"> forked </term> substrates , Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> substrates containing a nascent leading strand ( A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] ) , nascent lagging strand ( A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] ) , or both of them ( A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ,5  ] ) , as well as 5  - extension or 3  - extension structures were constructed .
Mcm4/6/7 bound to A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] or A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] with affinity similar to that of a simple Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> ( Figure 4A and data not shown ) .
In contrast , PriA helicase , used as a control , bound to A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] more efficiently than to A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] , as reported previously ( 23,25 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 bound also to 5  - extension and 3  - extension , albeit with slightly reduced affinity compared to A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] and A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] ( Figure 4A ) .
Mcm4/6/7 bound to A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ,5  ] with much lower affinity , and the <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> gave rise to a single band .
These findings indicate that the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> is loaded onto DNA preferentially and efficiently through single-stranded region , regardless of the presence of 3  - or 5  - terminus .
In contrast , only the substrate containing a 3  single-stranded DNA tail ( A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] ) was efficiently unwound and A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] or A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ,5  ] , was not unwound by Mcm4/6/7 ( Figure 4B ) .
Absence of helicase actions on A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ,5  ] composed only of duplex regions is expected since double-stranded DNA is not able to activate the ATPase activity of Mcm4/6/7 ( 10 ) .
In contrast , the PriA , a structure-specific helicase used as a control , binds at the <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> junction and unwinds the <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> and the nascent lagging strand DNA on A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] , or unwinds the nascent lagging strand on A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ,5  ] , as reported before ( 25 ) .
These results indicate that the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> binds to single-stranded DNA and that its helicase is activated only in the presence of a single-stranded 3  - tail .
3  - extension with poly ( dT ) tail is displaced by Mcm4/6/7 .
It has been reported that the 3  - extension can be unwound by the archaeal <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> homohexamer but not by fission and budding yeast <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm complexes </term> ( 14,26,27 ) .
We have constructed 3  - extension substrates containing poly ( dT ) , poly ( dA ) , poly ( dC ) and poly ( dG ) 3  - tails in order to examine whether mouse Mcm4/6/7 can displace these substrates .
We first found that Mcm4/6/7 binds to dT - , dC - and dG-3  - extension with similar affinity , and to dA-3  - extension with much lower affinity ( Figure 5A ) .
This is consistent with the previous results that Mcm4/6/7 binds to 50mer oligo-dT , - dC and - dG , but not to a 50mer oligo-dA ( 13 ) .
We found that dT-tailed 3  - extension was displaced efficiently by <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> 4/6/7 while almost no or very little activity was detected on other substrates ( Figure 5B and C ) .
This is in sharp contrast to yeast Mcm4/6/7 helicases which are not capable of unwinding 3  - extension substrates .
Furthermore , dT-tailed 5  - extension , to which Mcm4/6/7 could bind , was not displaced by the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
The addition of the 5  - tail to dT-tailed 3  - extension further stimulated the displacement ( Figure 5D ) , confirming the previous report that the <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork structures </term> facilitate the helicase action .
Thus , these results further strengthen our conclusion that the mammalian <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> is generally activated by the thymine-stretch on the 3  - single-stranded tail .
The effects of the thymine content of the 3  - tail on <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> activity .
We next examined more systematically the effect of the compositions of the thymine residues of the 3  - tail on the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> activity .
A partial heteroduplex M13 single-stranded DNA containing a 37 bp duplex region in the presence or absence of the 50 nt long 3  - tail of various nucleotide compositions were constructed and the unwinding by mouse Mcm4/6/7 was examined ( Figure 6A ) .
Due to its low processivity , Mcm4/6/7 barely displaced the annealed 37mer oligonucleotide without a 3  - tail ( 37mer ; Figure 6A ) .
Only weak helicase activity was observed on the substrate carrying the 3  - tail of 25 repeats of TA dinucleotide ( 37-TA25 ; Figure 6A ) , whereas strong helicase activity was observed on 37-TTA17 .
Increase of thymine content on the 3  - tail did not further increase the extent of unwinding ( 37-TTTA13 , 37-TTTTA10 and 37-T50 ; Figure 6A ) , suggesting that 17 repeats of TT dinucleotides ( 67 % thymine ) may be sufficient for activation of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
It should be noted that the TA25 tail would self-anneal and this would prevent the loading of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> , since the 3  - tail containing TTAA13 or TTTAAA8 did not enhance the unwinding either ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , we next examined the effects of repeating sequences of thymine and cytosine ( Figure 6B ) .
Partial heteroduplex substrates containing the 3  - tail of TC25 , TTCC13 , TTTCCC8 , TTTTCCCC6 , TTCC17 were displaced by the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> to the extent similar to that achieved by TTA17 , suggesting that 50 % thymine content is sufficient for full activation of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
TTCC13 and TTCC17 were displaced to a similar extent , consistent with the earlier result that a 40 nt tail is sufficient for activation ( 13 ) .
However , the efficiency of the displacement significantly decreased as the thymine content of the 3  - tail dropped to 33 % , as in TAA17 or TCC17 ( Figure 6B and C ) .
Thus , the minimal thymine content required for activation of the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> may be somewhere between 33 and 50 % .
DUE sequences from the c-myc origin activate <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
Our previous studies have shown that the sequences containing periodic ( dT ) n tracts derived from the human lamin B2 origin ( 48 % thymine content ) can serve as an efficient activator for the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> on a bubble , and replacement of thymines with guanines abolished the helicase activation ( 13,28 ) .
In order to examine other natural replication origins with different thymine contents for the ability to activate <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> on a bubble substrate , we constructed new bubble substrates , Bub82/c-myc , containing sequences derived from the DUE ( DNA unwinding element ) region of the human c-myc origin which is essential for c-myc replicator activity ( 29,30 ) .
The unpaired segment in Bub82/c-myc/DUE contains one strand of DUE and that in Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C contains another strand .
This DUE is believed to coincide with the initially unwound region of the c-myc origin ( 29 ) , and its deletion substantially reduced the replicator activity ( 30 ) .
Mcm4/6/7 unwound Bub82/lamin B2 ( thymine 48 % ) , Bub82/c-myc/DUE ( 37 % ) and Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C ( 39 % ) with similar efficiency ( Figure 7A ) , indicating that the sequences from the c-myc origin also can serve as efficient activators of the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
This result also indicates that sequences with 37 % thymine content can activate Mcm4/6/7 to displace 24 nt duplex on both sides in a bubble substrate , suggesting that the not only thymine content but also the sequence context may affect the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> activation .
In gel shift assays , MCM4/6/7 bound to all the three bubbles , although the affinity to Bub82/c-myc/DUE and to Bub82/c-myc/DUE-C is slightly lower than that to Bub-82 / lamin B2 ( Figure 7B ) .
Therefore , helicase and DNA binding activities do not necessarily correlate with each other .
This was also indicated by our previous results that guanine and cytosine stretches can bind to <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> but can not activate the helicase ( 13 ) .
DNA unwinding by Mcm4/6/7 is inhibited by the GC-rich sequences on the duplex segment .
Our results indicate that thymine-rich single-stranded DNA is required for initial loading and activation of the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
However , it is not known whether thymine sequences are required for processive unwinding of duplex DNA .
Therefore , we have examined whether the nucleotide composition of the duplex region affects its unwinding activity .
To address this issue , we constructed a series of T-tailed Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork structures </term> ( T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> ) containing various sequences in the duplex segment .
They carried varied contents of cytosine residues on the 3  - tail strand .
In gel shift assays , Mcm4/6/7 bound to these Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> substrates with identical affinity ( Figure 8A ) , consistent with the notion that the Mcm4/6/7 binds to single-stranded tails .
However , in DNA helicase assays , T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( C : G ) 49 was hardly displaced by Mcm4/6/7 , but was readily displaced by SV40 T-antigen DNA helicase ( Figure 8B ) .
When thymine or adenine is inserted as every third nucleotide ( repeats of CCT or CCA ) , the extent of unwinding increased ( T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( CCT : GGA ) 16 and T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( CCA : GGT ) 16 ) .
The efficiency of unwinding is roughly correlated with the content of GC pairs in the duplex segment [ T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( CCAA : GGTT ) 12 , T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( CCTT : GGAA ) 12 , T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( CAAA : GTTT ) 12 and T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( CTTT : GAAA ) 12 ; Figure 8B ] .
It appears that the duplex segment containing < 50 % GC pairs is efficiently unwound ( Figure 8C ) .
We next examined the effect of GC-rich segments on a partial heteroduplex DNA on a single-stranded circular DNA .
We have constructed two sets of 5  - tailed partial heteroduplex DNA substrates containing duplex regions of variable lengths ; one on M13mp18 vector and the other on M13mp19 containing a 66 nt long G-rich segment downstream of the hybridizing oligonucleotide .
We found that the Mcm4/6/7 helicase can displace duplex DNA up to 350 nt long on its own on the former substrate ( Figure 8D , left ) , consistent with previous results ( 13 ) .
In contrast , displacement was inhibited over the GC-rich segments on the latter substrate ( Figure 8D , right panel ) , although displacement up to 250 nt in length , albeit at a reduced level , was observed at a high concentration of Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> .
This result is consistent with that on Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> and indicates that GC-rich duplex segment is inhibitory for unwinding by the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> .
These results may indicate that the presence of thymine -- adenine pairs with a certain frequency in the duplex region may facilitate continuous unwinding by Mcm4/6/7 .
Alternatively , Mcm4/6/7 is not efficient enough to displace thermodynamically stable GC-base-paired segment .
In order to distinguish these two possibilities , we designed a new T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> substrate containing inosine ( I ) residue instead of guanosine residue .
The thermal stability of the I : C base pair is lower than that of the G : C base pair in duplex DNA due to loss of one hydrogen bond and is even lower than A : T base pair ( 31 ) .
We constructed the T-tailed <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> substrates containing the ( GCC : CGG ) 10 , ( GCC : CIG ) 10 or ( GAA : CTT ) 10 duplex DNA segment ( Figure 8E ) .
Mcm4/6/7 hardly displaced the 31 nt long duplex of GCC : CGG repeats , whereas the T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( GAA : CTT ) 10 was displaced efficiently , as described above .
T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( GCC : CIG ) 10 was displaced with efficiency much greater than that of T - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> / ( GCC : CGG ) 10 , indicating that the thermostability of the duplex segment , not the lack of AT base pair , is responsible for inability of Mcm4/6/7 to displace the duplex .
DNA helicase is a central factor for operation of <termsem="GO:0005657"> replication forks </term> .
It also plays a crucial role in the initiation step at the replication origins .
Therefore , the elucidation of how the replicative helicases interact with DNA substrate and how they are activated is crucial for understanding the molecular basis of initiation of DNA replication .
It is now believed that <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> is a major component of the eukaryotic replicative helicase .
In this report , we have conducted detailed analyses on binding and helicase actions of mouse Mcm4/6/7 using various substrates including fork and bubble structures .
Modes of binding and activation of Mcm4/6/7 helicase on a bubble structure .
Initiation of DNA replication is associated with localized melting of duplex DNA near replication origins .
Helicases are loaded onto <termsem="GO:0005657"> replication forks </term> through the melted region , induced by initiator binding , in bacteria ( 32 ) .
We previously reported that Mcm4/6/7 can be loaded onto a bubble-like structure and can serve as a DNA helicase at the <termsem="GO:0005657"> forks </term> ( 13 ) .
The ability of Mcm4/6/7 to unwind the bubble substrate but not the conventional duplex DNA ( Figures 2 and 13 ) indicates that <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> can be loaded through the single-stranded segment of the bubble .
Furthermore , the Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> displays marked preference for thymine-rich sequences within the single-stranded segment for helicase activation ( 13 ) .
The results in this report indicate that helicase action of Mcm4/6/7 on synthetic bubbles may depend on the presence of an unpaired region of sufficient length ( at least 40 nt ) , which may permit assembly of a double-hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> on the substrate DNA , similar to SV40 T-antigen protein ( Figure 2A ) ( 21 ) .
When one strand of the single-stranded segment in T-rich bubble was replaced by guanine-rich sequences , the efficiency of unwinding was significantly reduced .
Our footprinting analyses showed that Mcm4/6/7 strongly protects 25 nt single-stranded DNA segment adjacent to each branch point and proximal to 5  ends of both strands of the bubble .
At each <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> , one Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> is likely to encircle the single-stranded DNA strand and two hexamers may bind symmetrically to the bubble substrate , forming a double hexameric structure on the bubble ( see schematic drawing of Figure 1A ) .
Efficient unwinding into both directions may require simultaneous activation of both hexamers which may sit at the center while extruding the unwound single-stranded DNA through the rings .
This may closely resemble the proposed modes of binding and helicase actions of T-antigen ( 21 ) .
Although we can not totally exclude the possibility that one Mcm4/6/7 hexamer at each <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> unwinds the duplex independently , ring-shaped structures of mouse and archea <termsem="GO:0042555"> MCM </term> , as revealed by electron microscopy , bear much similarity to the recently solved structure of the SV40 large T-antigen ( 4,6 ) , and are in favor of the double-hexameric structure of mouse <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> on a bubble DNA .
Substrate and sequence requirement for Mcm4/6/7 helicase activation .
DNA binding assays indicate that Mcm4/6/7 binds to those substrates containing single-stranded DNA regions regardless of the presence or absence of single-stranded 3  or 5  end .
Unwinding of the duplex DNA depends on translocation of single-stranded DNA from 3  to 5  direction .
This is most clearly shown by its helicase action on A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 5  ] and 3  - extension but not on A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] , A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ,5  ] nor 5  - extension .
However , it does not necessarily require 3  end of single-stranded DNA , since Mcm4/6/7 can displace annealing oligonucleotide on a circular single-stranded DNA .
The ability of the mouse Mcm4/6/7 to unwind 3  - extension is shared by the archaeal <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> but not by Mcm4/6/7 from S.pombe and S.cerevisiae ( 14,26,27 ) .
The archaeal <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> can unwind A - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> [ 3  ] but eukaryotic Mcm4/6/7 can not , since the former binds to double-stranded DNA but the latter does not ( 5,27 ) .
While yeast <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicases </term> can translocate on duplex DNA , such activity was not observed with mammalian Mcm4/6/7 ( data not shown ) .
Occurrence of AT-rich sequences , with asymmetric distribution of adenine and thymine , near the replication origins , lead us to propose that <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> may play a role in selection of initiation sites of mammalian DNA replication , and prompted us to examine the ability of sequences from human replication origins to activate Mcm4/6/7 helicase .
Both lamin-B2 and c-myc origins served as efficient activator for <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> in vitro .
Consistent with it , site-specific loading of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> in the DNA replication initiation zone of the c-myc was recently reported ( 33 ) .
We have examined in detail the effect of sequence context of the single-stranded DNA on the helicase activity of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> .
The results indicate that thymine content of 50 % is sufficient for the maximum helicase activity .
The efficiency of displacement decreased as the thymine content of the 3  - tail dropped to 33 % ( Figure 6 ) .
The stretches of thymine residues may not be necessarily required , since repeats of TC dinucleotides served as a potent activator for Mcm4/6/7 .
We also noticed that the presence of a secondary structure within the single-stranded DNA is inhibitory for helicase action .
Nuclease footprinting assays indicated that binding was interfered by the secondary structure ( data not shown ) .
Thus , we have concluded that Mcm4/6/7 helicase is most efficiently activated by non-structured single-stranded DNA with thymine content of 50 % or more , although significant stimulation is observed also by DNA with less thymine content ( Figure 7 ) , suggesting that the sequence specificity for <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> activation is rather relaxed and that the extent of the activation may depend on the sequence context .
This would be reasonable given the flexibility and differential regulation of site selection for initiation of DNA replication during development or in various <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> types , as well as the variability in initiation potential of each replication origin on the genome even within the single <termsem="GO:0005623"> cell </term> type .
Mcm4/6/7 helicase during processive unwinding at the <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> .
The specific requirement of single-stranded thymine residues for activation of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> prompted us to examine whether they are required also for processive unwinding of duplex DNA .
Our results indicated that increase of GC pair in the duplex segment significantly inhibited the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> activity .
Duplex DNA composed only of GC pairs ( 10 repeats of CGG ) on a Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> was not displaced at all , while the same template was readily displaced by SV40 T-antigen ( Figure 8B ) .
<termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> was inhibited by the presence of GC-rich duplex segment also on a circular single-stranded partial heteroduplex substrate .
However , on this substrate , Mcm4/6/7 was able to displace DNA past the GC-rich region , albeit to a limited extent , when it was added at a high concentration .
On the partial heteroduplex template , <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> is loaded onto the circular single-stranded DNA of 6.4 kb , while it is loaded onto the 50 nt long 3  - tail DNA on the Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> .
Thus , the difference of helicase actions may reflect the efficiency of <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> loading .
Alternatively , the presence of ` random ' sequence at the initially unwound duplex segment in the former template may engage the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> in a more active conformation which can displace the GC-rich duplex segment .
On Y - <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> substrates , increase of AT base pairs in the duplex ( 10 repeats of CTT ) restored the unwinding .
These results indicate either that thymine residues are required on the duplex DNA for continuous unwinding , or that Mcm4/6/7 is simply not efficient enough to unwind the stable GC pairs .
Replacement of the central guanosine with inosine in the CGG repeat duplex DNA resulted in displacement ( Figure 8E ) ( 31 ) , suggesting that the continuous presence of AT base pair may not be essential for the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> function and that the thermostability of GC base pairs is inhibitory for helicase action of Mcm4/6/7 .
The results described in this manuscript reveal potentially important features of mammalian Mcm4/6/7 helicase , which is likely to be a key component of the eukaryotic replicative helicase .
Prior to initiation of DNA replication , <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> may adopt a double hexameric <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> at the partially melted origin region , and may catalyze concurrent unwinding of duplex DNA into both directions , while stably associated with the origins of DNA replication .
This is similar to the T-antigen model originally proposed by Smelkova and Borowiec ( 21 ) .
We propose that , only when both hexamers are activated by the interacting thymine-rich sequences present within the melted region , the <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm helicase </term> is mobilized and initiation takes place .
A crucial question is how these double hexameric <termsem="GO:0033202"> helicase complexes </term> are generated and turn into active helicases at the origins .
This process would involve melting of duplex DNA , which may be facilitated by binding of <termsem="GO:0005656"> preRC </term> components in the context of proper <termsem="GO:0000785"> chromatin structures </term> , or by other unwinding factors including a topoisomerase or a newly identified Mcm8 helicase ( 34 -- 36 ) .
It may also require association of <termsem="GO:0005657"> fork </term> - assisting proteins such as Cdc45 ( 37,38 ) as well as phosphorylation events by Cdk and Cdc7 kinases ( 39,40 ) .
One unexpected finding of this study is low helicase activity of Mcm4/6/7 on GC-rich duplex DNA .
This , in conjunction with the low processivity of Mcm4/6/7 helicase , strongly indicates that the replicative helicase at the <termsem="GO:0005657"> replication forks </term> would require more than Mcm4/6/7 <termsem="GO:0032991"> complex </term> .
During the processive unwinding of duplex <termsem="GO:0005657"> DNA replication forks </term> , Mcm4/6/7 may be further stimulated by interaction with other proteins , including remaining <termsem="GO:0042555"> Mcm </term> subunits , Cdc45 ( 37,38 ) , <termsem="GO:0000811"> GINS </term> ( 41,42 ) , <termsem="GO:0042575"> DNA polymerase </term> subunits ( 43 ) , Mcm8 ( 35,36 ) , etc. to become a truly processive and potent helicase capable of replicating the entire genome .
