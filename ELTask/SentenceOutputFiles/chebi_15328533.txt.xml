Regulation of Muscle Fiber Type and Running Endurance by PPAR .
Endurance exercise training can promote an adaptive muscle fiber transformation and an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis by triggering scripted changes in gene expression .
However , no transcription factor has yet been identified that can direct this process .
We describe the engineering of a mouse capable of continuous running of up to twice the distance of a wild-type littermate .
This was achieved by targeted expression of an activated form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  ( PPAR ) in skeletal muscle , which induces a switch to form increased numbers of type I muscle fibers .
Treatment of wild-type mice with PPAR <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonist </term> elicits a similar type I fiber gene expression profile in muscle .
Moreover , these genetically generated fibers confer resistance to obesity with improved metabolic profiles , even in the absence of exercise .
These results demonstrate that complex physiologic properties such as fatigue , endurance , and running capacity can be <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> molecularly </term> analyzed and manipulated .
Skeletal muscle fibers are generally classified as type I ( oxidative/slow ) or type II ( glycolytic/fast ) fibers .
They display marked differences in respect to contraction , metabolism , and susceptibility to fatigue .
Type I fibers are mitochondria-rich and mainly use oxidative metabolism for energy production , which provides a stable and long-lasting supply of <termsem="CHEBI:15422"> <termsem="CHEBI:30616"> ATP </term> </term> , and thus are fatigue-resistant .
Type II fibers comprise three subtypes , IIa , IIx , and IIb .
Type IIb fibers have the lowest levels of mitochondrial content and oxidative enzymes , rely on glycolytic metabolism as a major energy source , and are susceptible to fatigue , while the oxidative and contraction functions of type IIa and IIx lie between type I and IIb ( Booth and Thomason 1991 ; Berchtold et al. 2000 ; Olson and Williams 2000 ) .
Adult skeletal muscle shows plasticity and can undergo conversion between different fiber types in response to exercise training or modulation of motoneuron activity ( Booth and Thomason 1991 , Jarvis et al. 1996 ; Pette 1998 ; Olson and Williams 2000 ; Hood 2001 ) .
This conversion of muscle fiber from type IIb to type IIa and type I is likely to be mediated by a <termsem="CHEBI:22984"> calcium </term> signaling pathway that involves calcineurin , calmodulin-dependent kinase , and the transcriptional cofactor Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 ( PGC-1 ) ( Naya et al. 2000 ; Olson and Williams 2000 ; Lin et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) .
However , the targeted transcriptional factors directly responsible for reprogramming the fiber-specific contractile and metabolic genes remain to be identified .
Muscle fiber specification appears to be associated with obesity and diabetes .
For instance , rodents that gain the most weight on high-fat diets possess fewer type I fibers ( Abou et al. 1992 ) .
In obese patients , skeletal muscle has been observed to have reduced oxidative capacity , increased glycolytic capacity , and a decreased percentage of type I fibers ( Hickey et al. 1995 ; Tanner et al. 2002 ) .
Similar observations have been made in type 2 diabetic patients ( Lillioja et al. 1987 ; Hickey et al. 1995 ) .
Recently , it has been shown that increasing oxidative fibers can lead to improved <termsem="CHEBI:5931"> insulin </term> action and reduced adipocyte size ( Luquet et al. 2003 ; Ryder et al. 2003 ) .
We have previously established that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR )  is a major transcriptional regulator of fat burning in adipose tissue through activation of enzymes associated with <termsem="CHEBI:15904"> long-chain fatty-acid </term> -oxidation ( Wang et al. 2003 ) .
Although PPAR is the predominant PPAR isoform present in skeletal muscle , its in vivo function has not been determined .
Our current study uncovers PPAR as the first transcription factor able to drive the formation of functional type I muscle fibers , whose activation entrains complex pathways both enhancing physical performance and creating a state of obesity resistance .
Activation of PPAR Leads to Muscle Fiber Transformation .
A role of PPAR in muscle fiber was suggested by its enhanced expression -- at levels 10-fold and 50-fold greater than PPAR and  isoforms , respectively ( unpublished data ) .
An examination of PPAR in different muscle fibers reveals a significantly higher level in type I muscle ( soleus ) relative to type II -- rich muscle ( extensor digitorum longus ) or type I and type II mixed muscle ( gastrocnemius ) ( Figure 1A ) ; this expression pattern closely resembles that of PGC-1 ( Lin et al. 2002 ) .
A similar pattern but with more pronounced differences was found at the <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> level ( Figure 1B ) .
To directly assess the role of activation of PPAR in control of muscle fiber plasticity and mitochondrial biogenesis , we generated mice expressing a transgene in which the 78 - <termsem="CHEBI:33708"> <termsem="CHEBI:32952"> <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> amino </term> </term> - <termsem="CHEBI:37527"> acid </term> </term> VP16 activation domain was fused to the <termsem="CHEBI:46882"> N </term> - terminus of full-length PPAR , under control of the 2.2-kb human -skeletal actin promoter .
In agreement with the previous characterization of this promoter ( Brennan and Hardeman 1993 ; Clapham et al. 2000 ) , the VP16-PPAR transgene was selectively expressed in skeletal muscle , with 10-fold less in the heart ( Figure 1C ) .
Among different types of muscle fibers , the levels of VP16-PPAR expression appeared to be similar ( unpublished data ) .
As shown in Figure 1D for gastrocnemius muscle , VP16-PPAR fusion <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> was produced at a level similar to that of endogenous PPAR in wild-type littermates .
Interestingly , the level of endogenous muscle PPAR <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> in the transgenic mice was much higher than in the control littermates .
The substantial increase of endogenous PPAR may have been caused by a switch to type I fiber ( see below ) , which intrinsically expresses higher levels of PPAR ( Figure 1A and 1B ) .
Type I muscle can be readily distinguished from type II or mixed muscle by its red color , because of its high concentration of <termsem="CHEBI:7044"> myoglobin </term> , a <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> typically expressed in oxidative muscle fibers .
We found that muscles in the transgenic mice appeared redder ( Figure 2A ) , which is particularly evident in the mixed type I/II fibers of the hindlimb ( Figure 2B ) .
Indeed , metachromatic staining revealed a substantial muscle fiber transformation ( Figure 2C ) .
In gastrocnemius muscle , we estimated that there was a 2-fold increase of type I fibers .
A diagnostic component of oxidative fibers is their high <termsem="CHEBI:7044"> myoglobin </term> and mitochondrial content , which is supported by the <termsem="CHEBI:33699"> mRNA </term> analysis shown in Figure 3A .
In addition to <termsem="CHEBI:7044"> myoglobin </term> , mitochondrial components for <termsem="CHEBI:10545"> electron </term> transfer ( <termsem="CHEBI:18070"> cytochrome c </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:18070"> cytochrome c </term> oxidase [ COX ] II and IV ) and <termsem="CHEBI:35366"> fatty-acid </term> -oxidation enzymes were elevated ( Figure 3A ; unpublished data ) .
These effects appear to be direct consequences of PPAR activation , as levels of PGC-1 , a coactivator involved in muscle fiber switch and mitochondrial biogenesis ( Wu et al. 1999 ; Lehman et al. 2000 ; Lin et al. 2002 ) , remained unchanged .
Southern blot analysis detected a substantially higher copy number of the mitochondrial genome -- encoded COXII DNA in the transgenic mice ( Figure 3B ) .
Mitochondrial DNA was increased 2.3-fold in gastrocnemius muscle of the transgenic mice ( Figure 3C ) .
These results reveal a marked stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and further support the idea that there is a muscle fiber switch .
This conclusion was also confirmed by Western blot analysis .
As shown in Figure 3D , the characteristic type I fiber <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , such as <termsem="CHEBI:7044"> myoglobin </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:18070"> cytochrome c </term> and b , were significantly increased .
More importantly , the specialized contraction <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> troponin I ( slow ) of type I fiber was robustly induced ; this was accompanied by a marked reduction of the specialized contraction <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> protein </term> troponin I ( fast ) of type II fiber , indicating a high degree of fiber transformation .
We next examined whether acute activation of endogenous PPAR would induce similar target genes .
In agreement with the chronic effects in the transgenic mice , we found that , after treatment of wild-type C57B6J mice with the PPAR-specific <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonist </term> GW501516 for only 10 d , genes for slow fiber contractile <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> , mitochondrial biogenesis , and -oxidation were all upregulated ( Figure 3E ) .
This indicates that rapid , systematic , and coordinated changes of muscle fiber properties toward type I can be achieved by activation of the endogenous PPAR pathway .
Muscle Fiber Switch by PPAR Protects Against Obesity .
A number of previous studies have shown that obese individuals have fewer oxidative fibers , implying that the presence of oxidative fibers alone may play a part in obesity resistance .
To test this possibility , we fed the transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates with a high-fat diet for 97 d. Although the initial body weights of the two groups were very similar , the transgenic mice had gained less than 50 % at day 47 , and only one-third at day 97 , of the weight gained by the wild-type animals ( Figure 4A ) .
The transgenic mice displayed significantly higher <termsem="CHEBI:15379"> oxygen </term> consumption on the high-fat diet than the control littermates ( unpublished data ) .
By the end of this experiment , the control littermates became obese , whereas the transgenic mice still maintained a normal body weight and fat mass composition ( Figure 4A ) .
A histological analysis of inguinal fat pad revealed a much smaller cell size in the transgenic mice ( Figure 4B ) , due to the increased muscle oxidative capacity .
While there was no significant difference in intramuscular <termsem="CHEBI:28087"> glycogen </term> content , the <termsem="CHEBI:17855"> triglyceride </term> content was much less in the transgenic mice ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , which may explain their improved <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> glucose </term> tolerance ( Figure 4E ) .
We also placed wild-type C57BJ6 mice on the high-fat diet and treated them with either vehicle or the PPAR <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonist </term> GW501516 for 2 mo. .
GW501516 produced a sustained induction of genes for type I muscle fibers ; this , at least in part , resulted in an only 30 % gain in body weight , a dramatically reduced fat mass accumulation , and improved <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> glucose </term> tolerance , compared to the vehicle-treated group ( Figure 5 ) .
Thus , muscle fiber conversion by stimulation with the PPAR <termsem="CHEBI:48705"> agonist </term> or the activated transgene has a protective role against obesity .
Activation of PPAR Enhances Physical Performance .
Muscle oxidative capacity is a crucial factor for determining endurance and fatigue .
Indeed , type I fibers adaptively generated through exercise training are considered to be fatigue resistant .
However , whether the type I fibers generated <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> molecularly </term> via PPAR expression can contribute to enhanced performance in the absence of previous training is unclear .
In fact , the consequence of genetically induced fiber switch on running capacity has to our knowledge never been evaluated .
We thus compared exercise performance between untrained , body-weight-matched transgenic and wild-type littermates .
Mice were run on <termsem="CHEBI:15379"> oxygen </term> - infused , enclosed treadmills until exhaustion .
Strikingly , the running time and distance the transgenic mice were able to sustain were increased by 67 % and 92 % , respectively ( Figure 6A ; also see Videos S1 and S2 ) .
The transgenic mice ran about 1 h longer than the controls , which translates to nearly a kilometer further .
No significant differences in muscle mass ( unpublished data ) and daily activity ( total counts of activity per hour : 1618  209 for transgenic versus 1987  301 for wild-type , p > 0.35 , n = 4 ) were observed between the transgenic and control mice .
Thus , the remarkable increase in endurance is the physiologic manifestation of muscle fiber transformation .
This suggests that genetically directed muscle fiber switch is physiologically and functionally relevant .
In addition , we looked at what effect the absence of PPAR function has on exercise endurance .
In the treadmill test , the PPAR-null mice could sustain only 38 % of the running time and 34 % of the distance of their age - and weight-matched wild-type counterparts ( Figure 6B ) .
These results further support a role for PPAR in enhancement of physical performance .
Our data reveal that a PPAR-mediated transcriptional pathway can regulate muscle fiber specification , enabling the generation of a strain of mice with a `` long-distance running '' phenotype .
We show that targeted expression of an activated form of PPAR produces profound and coordinated increases in oxidation enzymes , mitochondrial biogenesis , and production of specialized type I fiber contractile <termsem="CHEBI:36080"> proteins </term> -- the three hallmarks for muscle fiber type switching ( Figure 6C ) .
While induction of muscle oxidation enzymes by PPAR has been seen both in vivo and in vitro ( Muoio et al. 2002 ; Dressel et al. 2003 ; Luquet et al. 2003 ; Tanaka et al. 2003 ; Wang et al. 2003 ) , its effects shown here on muscle fiber switching are unexpected .
These progressive changes in oxidative capacity in conjunction with eventual changes in type I muscle fiber lead to a dramatically improved exercise profile and protection against obesity .
This does not solely depend on achieving a directed muscle fiber type switch but also requires all the associated changes in neural innervation , motor neuron function , and peripheral metabolic adaptation to enable a new integrated physiological response .
Accordingly , activation of muscle PPAR essentially recapitulates the effects of exercise training even in the absence of training itself .
To our knowledge , this has not been directly described for any other transcriptional factor .
The muscle phenotypes described here are remarkably similar to those of transgenic mice expressing either calcineurin , calmodulin-dependent kinase , or PGC-1 ( Naya et al. 2000 ; Lin et al. 2002 ; Wu et al. 2002 ) , indicating that PPAR could be one of the hypothetical downstream transcription factors of these pathways .
It is important to note that , from our ligand and gain-of-function transgenic studies , PPAR needs to be activated in order to direct the muscle fiber switch .
Indeed , in a recent report by Luquet et al. ( 2003 ) , simple overexpression of wild-type PPAR in muscle was found not to be sufficient to promote a fiber switch or obesity resistance , although certain oxidation enzymes were increased .
This supports the model in Figure 6C that the activating signal or ligand , but not the receptor , is limiting .
Thus , PPAR activation , rather than merely an increase of PPAR levels , is an essential element for fiber switching and its associated functional manifestations .
How might endogenous PPAR become activated naturally by exercise training ?
First , it is possible that exercise generates or increases endogenous ligands for PPAR as tissues are undergoing substantial increases in <termsem="CHEBI:35366"> fatty-acid </term> internalization and burning .
<termsem="CHEBI:35366"> Fatty acids </term> and their <termsem="CHEBI:25212"> metabolites </term> can activate PPAR .
A second model is that exercise may induce expression of PGC-1 ( Goto et al. 2000 ) and thereby activate PPAR .
This is consistent with previous work in which we have shown that PGC-1 physically associates with PPAR in muscle tissue and can powerfully activate it even in the absence of ligands ( Wang et al. 2003 ) .
Alternatively , PPAR may be activated by a distal upstream signaling component such as a kinase cascade .
Further dissecting the interactions between PPAR and its regulatory components will be necessary to fully understand the <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> molecular </term> basis of muscle fiber determination pertinent to exercise training .
Skeletal muscle is a major site to regulate whole-body <termsem="CHEBI:35366"> fatty-acid </term> and <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> glucose </term> metabolism .
We show that mice with increased oxidative fibers are resistant to high-fat-induced obesity and <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> glucose </term> intolerance .
Moreover , ligand studies provide compelling evidence that activation of endogenous PPAR can produce similar effects .
Might PPAR have any beneficial effects on <termsem="CHEBI:17234"> glucose </term> metabolism in the lean condition ?
This has not been explored ; however , <termsem="CHEBI:5931"> insulin </term> resistance in the elderly is confined mostly to skeletal muscle and may be due to reduction of mitochondrial number and/or function ( Petersen et al. 2003 ) .
The ability of PPAR to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function suggests that PPAR could be important for control of <termsem="CHEBI:5931"> insulin </term> resistance during normal aging .
Together , these data indicate that PPAR and its ligands comprise a key <termsem="CHEBI:36357"> molecular </term> switch to regulate muscle fiber specification , obesity resistance , <termsem="CHEBI:5931"> insulin </term> sensitivity , and , most surprisingly , physical endurance .
This work demonstrates that complex physiologic properties such as fatigue , endurance , and running capacity can be genetically manipulated .
