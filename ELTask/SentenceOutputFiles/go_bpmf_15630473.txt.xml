A <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling Pathway </term> Involving TGF-2 and Snail in <termsem="GO:0031069"> Hair Follicle Morphogenesis </term> .
In a common theme of <termsem="GO:0048513"> organogenesis </term> , certain cells within a multipotent epithelial sheet exchange signals with their neighbors and <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> into a bud structure .
Using hair bud <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> as a paradigm , we employed mutant mouse models and cultured keratinocytes to dissect the contributions of multiple extracellular cues in orchestrating <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> dynamics and <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> to shape the cluster of cells involved .
We found that transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> 2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> is necessary to transiently induce the <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> Snail and activate the Ras - <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mitogen-activated protein kinase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> ) pathway in the bud .
In the epidermis , Snail misexpression leads to hyperproliferation and a reduction in <termsem="GO:0016337"> intercellular adhesion </term> .
When E-cadherin is <termsem="GO:0016481"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptionally </term> down-regulated </term> , associated <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> proteins with dual functions in <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> are released from cell-cell contacts , a process which we demonstrate leads to Ras - <termsem="GO:0000187"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> activation </term> .
These studies provide insights into how multipotent cells within a sheet are <termsem="GO:0001775"> stimulated </term> to undergo <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> changes that result in <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> , junctional remodeling , and bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
This novel <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathway </term> further weaves together the web of different <termsem="GO:0016015"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> morphogens </term> </term> and downstream <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional events </term> that <termsem="GO:0065007"> guide </term> hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> within the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skin .
Mammalian <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> involves the <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> of complex three-dimensional structures from seemingly uniform sheets or masses of cells .
A simple bud-like structure initiates the formation of many organs , including lungs , spinal cord , mammary glands , and hair follicles [ 1 ] .
The multipotent , <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhering </term> epithelial cells are typically <termsem="GO:0022610"> attached </term> to an underlying basal lamina that <termsem="GO:0007164"> polarizes </term> the epithelial sheet and separates it from surrounding mesenchyme .
Budding <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> is <termsem="GO:0065007"> guided </term> by a reciprocal exchange of signals between epithelium and mesenchyme to <termsem="GO:0007389"> specify </term> the identity of the organ that will <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> and to <termsem="GO:0065007"> govern </term> its <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> .
At the helm of these <termsem="GO:0007154"> molecular communication pathways </term> are Wnts , bone <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenic </term> proteins ( BMPs ) , transforming <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> s ( TGF-s ) , and fibroblast <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factors </term> </term> ( FGFs ) .
Through activation of cell surface <termsem="GO:0004888"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> transmembrane receptors </term> </term> , these external <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> molecules trigger distinct <termsem="GO:0007242"> cascades of intracellular events </term> that culminate in changes in <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> , and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> [ 2 ] .
How this constellation of signals collaborates in tailoring each budding process so that it executes a distinct <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenetic </term> program has yet to be comprehensively defined .
However , the process appears to be patterned at the initial stages of bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , since the relative importance of these pathways and their downstream effectors differ as buds begin to <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> and cell fates are <termsem="GO:0001708"> specified </term> .
The <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> of a bud requires a number of coordinated changes in the behavior of the targeted cells within an epithelial sheet .
The process must be accompanied by alterations in the proliferation , polarity , shape , and adhesiveness of selected cells , as well as by modifications in their underlying basal lamina .
Thus , extracellular epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk must be intricately orchestrated to couple the determination of distinct cell fates with the contemporaneous remodeling of the physical and structural properties of the cell .
Among the few dispensable organs , hair follicles offer an excellent model system to study epithelial bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
Mammalian skin epithelium begins as a single sheet of multipotent ectodermal cells .
During <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , specialized mesenchymal cells populate the skin in a spatially defined pattern to initiate the complex epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk that will <termsem="GO:0007389"> specify </term> the bud [ 3 ] .
Once <termsem="GO:0045165"> committed </term> , a small cluster of epithelial cells , the placode , instructs a group of underlying mesenchymal cells to condense and <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> the nascent dermal papilla , which will be a permanent fixture of the hair follicle .
Subsequent exchanges between the placode and nascent dermal papilla result in further <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> of the follicle into the underlying dermis , or down - <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> , and eventual <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> into the six concentric layers of the mature follicle .
Previously , we delineated how two respective epithelial and mesenchymal signals , Wnts and the BMP-inhibitory factor noggin , function in concert to induce lymphoid enhancer factor-1 / -catenin ( LEF-1 / -catenin ) - mediated gene <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> within the follicle placode [ 4 ] .
The downstream changes elicited through convergence of these two early <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathways </term> include <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of the gene encoding E-cadherin , the prototypical epithelial cadherin that forms the transmembrane core of intercellular adherens junctions ( AJs ) [ 5 ] .
We subsequently showed that when E-cadherin is transgenically elevated in mouse skin , <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> is blocked , suggesting that E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> is a critical event in <termsem="GO:0065007"> governing </term> the <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> dynamics necessary for budding <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> [ 4 ] .
Like LEF-1 , E-cadherin also <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to -catenin .
At sites of cell-cell contact , however , E-cadherin--catenin complexes <termsem="GO:0051234"> recruit </term> -catenin , which in turn coordinates the associated <termsem="GO:0030041"> actin polymerization </term> dynamics necessary to stabilize nascent AJs and integrate the cytoskeleton across an epithelial sheet [ 6,7,8 ] .
-Catenin also <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to the class III Lin-1 , Isl-1 , Mec-3 ( LIM ) protein Ajuba ( a member of the zyxin family of proteins ) , which appears to function dually in both <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> and in activation of the Ras - <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> mitogen-activated protein kinase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> ) pathway [ 9,10 ] .
Through these links , AJs appear able to couple <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> with cytoskeletal dynamics as well as with nuclear and cytoplasmic <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> .
This provides a framework for conceptualizing why E-cadherin levels appear to impact upon a plethora of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental processes </term> ( reviewed in [ 11 ] ) .
As we probed more deeply into the underlying mechanisms <termsem="GO:0065007"> governing </term> E-cadherin promoter activity , we were intrigued by the close proximity of the LEF-1 / <termsem="GO:0008013"> -catenin binding </term> site to a site known to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> the Snail/Slug family of zinc finger <termsem="GO:0016564"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> repressor </term> </term> proteins [ 12,13,14,15 ] .
Both activity of Snail and <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of E-cadherin play pivotal roles in <termsem="GO:0001837"> epithelial to mesenchymal transitions </term> ( <termsem="GO:0001837"> EMTs </term> ) , typified by the transformation of <termsem="GO:0030010"> polarized </term> , <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhering </term> epithelial cells into <termsem="GO:0006928"> motile </term> mesenchymal cells [ 16,17 ] .
Bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> differs from an <termsem="GO:0001837"> EMT </term> in that E-cadherin activity needs to be <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> but not prevented , so that <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesive </term> junctions are remodeled rather than quantitatively impaired .
Supportive of an underlying ability to fine-tune cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> level , Snail seems to have an additive effect with LEF-1 / -catenin in <termsem="GO:0048519"> negatively modulating </term> E-cadherin promoter activity [ 4 ] .
In the present study , we discovered that Snail is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> briefly at an early stage of hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , when E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> and activation of <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> take place .
Thereafter , Snail disappears and remains absent during subsequent follicle down - <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> and maturation .
This exquisite pattern appears to be functionally relevant since altering it in vivo correspondingly affects features associated with hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> , including <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of E-cadherin , increased <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> , and <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressed </term> terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> .
Although the temporal spike of Snail in the hair bud is reflected at the mRNA level and seems to follow <termsem="GO:0016055"> Wnt signaling </term> and BMP inhibition , LEF-1 / -catenin activation does not appear to induce Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in embryonic skin keratinocytes .
In contrast , we provide in vitro , transgenic ( Tg ) , and gene targeting evidence to show that TGF-2 and small phenotype -- and mothers against decapentaplegic -- related protein 2 ( SMAD2 ) <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> are upstream inducers of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in skin epithelium .
In the absence of TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> and Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , hair placodes can <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> , but further follicle down - <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> is blocked .
Our studies point to the view that Snail likely functions downstream of <termsem="GO:0001708"> cell fate specification </term> , at a stage where the bud begins to exhibit <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration </term> .
Snail mRNA and Protein Are <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expressed </term> Transiently at the Hair Bud Stage of <termsem="GO:0031069"> Follicle Morphogenesis </term> .
Although Snail family members are most frequently associated with <termsem="GO:0001837"> EMTs </term> , they also participate in many malignant processes involving a <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> but not a quantitative abrogation of intercellular junctions [ 18 ] .
The range of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developmental processes </term> in which Snail family members have been implicated thus includes the type of epithelial <termsem="GO:0048771"> remodeling </term> that is observed in hair follicle bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
Given our prior observation that exogenously added Snail can participate with LEF-1 / -catenin in <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulating </term> E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in keratinocytes [ 4 ] , coupled with the established requirement for LEF-1 / -catenin in <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> [ 4,19 ] , we turned to addressing whether Snail/Slug family members might also participate in the process .
PCR analyses identified transient Snail mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> during a period of skin <termsem="GO:0009790"> embryogenesis </term> when waves of hair follicles are <termsem="GO:0032502"> forming </term> ( unpublished data ) .
To pinpoint specifically where Snail mRNA is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skin , we conducted in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> using a cRNA probe unique to the Snail 3  untranslated region ( UTR ) .
Embryonic day 17.5 ( E17 .5 ) was chosen , since the multiple waves of <termsem="GO:0031069"> follicle morphogenesis </term> occurring at this time enabled us to evaluate Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at different stages of the process .
As shown in Figure 1A , specific <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> was detected within the epithelium of nascent hair buds .
By contrast , as follicles progressed further through their <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( e.g. , germ and peg stages ) , they exhibited no signs of <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> ( Figure 1A ) .
The transient nature of Snail mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> during follicle <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> was most apparent in <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridized </term> </term> skin sections containing follicles from two different waves of <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> ( as shown in Figure 1 ) .
<termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> Hybridizing </term> </term> hair buds from a later wave appeared juxtaposed with nonhybridizing follicles from an earlier wave .
To determine whether this transient nature of Snail mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is reflected at the protein level , we <termsem="GO:0009058"> generated </term> an antibody against the N-terminal sequence that resides upstream of the more conserved zinc finger domains .
As judged by Western blot analysis , the antibody did not detect endogenous proteins from cultured keratinocytes , but it did yield a band of the expected size from keratinocytes transiently <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> a hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Snail protein ( Figure 1B ) .
The antibody also recognized a band corresponding to the size of endogenous Snail ( approximately 28 kDa ) in lysates from embryonic mouse skin , the temporal appearance of which corresponded to the waves of <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> from E15 .5 to newborn when over 90 % of the hair on the mouse is <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> ( Figure 1B ) .
Consistent with the Western blot data , immunohistochemical analysis did not detect Snail in single-layered E13 .5 epidermis ( Figure 1C ) nor in the placode , which is the earliest morphological sign of the commitment of multipotent cells of the embryonic ectoderm to a hair cell fate ( Figure 1D ) .
Consistent with the in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> results , anti-Snail antibody labeled only hair buds and not follicles at more mature stages of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( Figure 1E ) .
Taken together , the anti-Snail antibody appeared to be specific for its target protein .
It did not detect other Snail family members known to be <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in keratinocytes and/or skin ( unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , the immunohistochemical data paralleled our Snail in situ <termsem="GO:0000739"> <termsem="GO:0033592"> hybridization </term> </term> data revealing transient Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> at the hair bud stage ( Figure 1A ) .
As judged by immunohistochemistry , Snail protein was <termsem="GO:0051179"> localized </term> to the nuclei of the hair bud cells ( Figure 1E ) .
This feature was consistent with Snail 's known function as a <termsem="GO:0016564"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> repressor </term> </term> [ 12,13 ] .
Additionally , anti-Snail labeling was detected in only three of the four major waves of <termsem="GO:0031069"> follicle morphogenesis </term> .
Snail was not found in the buds of guard hairs that are the earliest of all hairs to <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> ( at E13 .5 ) , and which constitute less than 5 % of the mouse coat ( unpublished data ) .
As judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> nuclear antigen Ki67 , the timing of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> coincided with the stage at which the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> follicle <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> its <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> and down - <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> ( Figure 1F ) .
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against the active ( <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylated </term> ) form of <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> ( pMAPK ) marked a subset of the <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> ( Ki67-positive ) cells , and pMAPK-positive cells were enriched in the hair bud ( Figure 1G ) .
The timing of Snail induction and Ki67 and pMAPK enrichment in the hair bud appeared to follow closely the induction of LEF-1 / -catenin activity , known to initiate in the hair placode stage [ 20 ] .
However , like placodes , hair buds exhibited <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> in E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> ( Figure 1H ; see also [ 4 ] ) .
Sustained <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Snail Results in Epidermal Hyperproliferation and <termsem="GO:0030154"> Differentiation </term> Defects in Tg Mouse Skin .
The striking spike of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> coincident with hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> and <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> prompted us to examine the consequences of ectopically <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> Snail elsewhere in mouse skin epidermis .
To distinguish Tg from endogenous Snail , we used the HA-epitope , shown previously not to alter Snail 's <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional activity </term> [ 12 ] .
Of 20 K14-Snail [ HA ] Tg animals <termsem="GO:0000003"> generated </term> , three <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> the transgene and all exhibited analogous phenotypes .
Mice that integrated the transgene at the single-cell stage <termsem="GO:0016265"> died </term> at or shortly after <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
The three surviving full-Tg founder mice harbored transgene integrations that gave stable transmission of mosaic Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> through the germline .
Progressively poor health necessitated our sacrificing most offspring from these lines within a year of <termsem="GO:0007567"> birth </term> .
As Snail Tg animals <termsem="GO:0040007"> grew </term> , they became distinguished by their small size , short tails , and flaky skin ( Figure 2A ) .
Histological analyses of 3-d old ( P3 ) mice revealed mosaic patches marked by epidermal thickening ( Figure 2B ) .
The mosaic morphology was reflected at the level of Tg Snail protein , with only the hyperthickened regions <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> nuclear HA-tagged Snail ( Figure 2C ) .
These hyperthickened areas were marked by excessive <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> , as revealed by antibodies against the <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> nuclear antigen Ki67 ( Figure 2D and 2E ) .
<termsem="GO:0001775"> Activated </term> , pMAPK-positive cells were also prevalent in these areas ( Figure 2F and 2G ) , as were cells <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> keratin 6 , a keratin induced in the suprabasal layers of hyperproliferative skin ( Figure 2H and 2I ) .
<termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of the Snail transgene did not block terminal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> in the hyperproliferative epidermis , but it distorted it markedly ( Figure 3A -- 3H ) .
Typical of most hyperproliferating conditions , Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> led to a large <termsem="GO:0008283"> expansion </term> in layers with spinous and granular morphology .
Additionally , however , was a marked and variable expansion of keratin 5 ( K5 ) , normally restricted to the innermost basal layer ( see Figure 3 ) .
Although the failure of Snail-null mice to <termsem="GO:0032502"> develop </term> past <termsem="GO:0007369"> gastrulation </term> [ 21 ] precluded our ability to study the loss of Snail function in <termsem="GO:0043588"> skin development </term> , a good correlation emerged between the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Snail protein and the extension of K5 , Ki67 , and pMAPK suprabasally ( compare data in Figures 2 and 3 ) .
The changes in hyperproliferation and <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> were not initially accompanied by gross signs of epithelial invaginations .
With age , however , epidermal folds and undulations <termsem="GO:0032502"> developed </term> in areas where Snail was <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> , and <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> markers persisted in these regions ( Figure 3I and 3J ; anti-cyclin D staining ) .
The undulations were accompanied by partial dissolution of the underlying basement membrane ( Figure 3K and 3L ) .
Aberrant staining was also observed with antibodies against components of the hemidesmosomes , which provide strong adhesion of basal epidermal cells to the underlying basal lamina ( Figure 3M and 3N ) .
Interestingly , similar types of alterations occur in the basement membrane in the hair bud of embryonic and newborn mice when Snail is normally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> .
The fact that the basement membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis is altered only in the adult Tg animals suggests the involvement of intermediary factors not as readily available in the epidermis as they are in the follicle .
Possible Links between Epidermal Hyperproliferation and <termsem="GO:0048519"> Down-regulation </term> of AJ Proteins in Snail Tg Mice .
Given that the E-cadherin promoter is a direct target for Snail-mediated <termsem="GO:0048519"> repression </term> in vitro [ 4,12,13 ] , and that E-cadherin was <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> in Snail - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> hair buds , we examined the status of E-cadherin and other AJ proteins within regions of hyperproliferative epidermis where Tg Snail was present ( Figure 4A ) .
In these regions , immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin and -catenin were markedly diminished .
In contrast , the intensity of antibody staining for two other AJ proteins , -catenin and Ajuba , was still strong .
Interestingly , however , despite appreciable immunofluorescence , <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> of -catenin and Ajuba appeared to be largely cytoplasmic rather than at cell-cell borders ( Figure 4A insets ) .
Architectural differences in the epidermis made Western blot analyses somewhat difficult to gauge .
However , in regions such as ear skin , where the highest levels of Snail protein were <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> , the effects were accentuated .
In both back skin and ear skin , overall levels of E-cadherin and -catenin were reduced , under conditions where -catenin and Ajuba levels remained unchanged relative to controls ( Figure 4B ) .
Taken together , these data were consistent with our results obtained from immunofluorescence microscopy .
A priori , the decrease in -catenin levels could be due to either direct <termsem="GO:0016481"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> repression </term> by Snail or perturbations in AJ <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> caused by the decrease in E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> .
To distinguish between these possibilities , we tested whether -catenin levels could be restored by exogenous <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of E-cadherin in Snail - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> keratinocytes .
As shown in Figure 4C , transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> keratinocytes <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> HA-tagged Snail displayed a loss of E-cadherin and -catenin at cell-cell borders .
Coexpression of exogenous HA-tagged E-cadherin not only enabled cell-cell border localization of E-cadherin protein , but also rescued the cell-cell border staining of -catenin ( Figure 4C ) .
The ability to restore -catenin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> under these conditions argues against the notion that Snail <termsem="GO:0016481"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptionally </term> represses </term> -catenin .
Rather , the findings are consistent with a previous report that E-cadherin is required for the translation of -catenin mRNA [ 22 ] .
Despite the reductions in AJ markers , Tg skin still displayed sealed membranes and intercellular junctions that were largely intact , as judged by ultrastructural analyses ( unpublished data ) .
In this respect , the skin epithelium resembled that of the hair bud , where the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> in junction proteins is permissive for cell-cell remodeling without abrogating <termsem="GO:0016337"> intercellular adhesion </term> .
The similarities between Snail Tg epidermis and hair buds extended to the hyperproliferative state , leading us to wonder whether the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of AJ proteins might contribute to this condition .
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Snail Tg epidermis ( see Figure 2G ) , we used pMAPK levels as our assay to test whether the loss of E-cadherin contributed to the Snail-mediated increase in <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> .
Consistent with our in vivo observations , <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> keratinocytes <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> Snail exhibited a substantial increase in pMAPK levels relative to control cells ( Figure 4D ) .
Coexpression of E-cadherin with Snail appeared to abrogate this effect .
Together , these findings raised the possibility that an AJ-associated protein that is normally <termsem="GO:0051235"> sequestered </term> at the plasma membrane may participate in a <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathway </term> when AJs are <termsem="GO:0022411"> deconstructed </term> .
Numerous studies have correlated a <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of E-cadherin with a translocation of -catenin to the nucleus and a transactivation of genes that are <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> by the LEF-1 / T cell factor ( TCF ) family of <termsem="GO:0003677"> DNA binding </term> proteins [ 23,24,25 ] .
The presence of nuclear cyclin D in hyperproliferative Snail Tg epidermis was particularly intriguing since prior studies have reported cyclin D gene as a direct target of TCF/-catenin <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> [ 26 ] .
This said , we did not detect nuclear -catenin in our Tg epidermis , and <termsem="GO:0007618"> mating </term> the Snail Tg mice against the TOPGal reporter mouse [ 20 ] gave no signs of ectopic LEF-1 / Tcf/-catenin activity ( unpublished data ) .
We next turned to the presence of cytoplasmic Ajuba for a possible mechanistic link to the <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> increase in our Snail Tg epidermis .
In addition to its documented ability to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> -catenin [ 10 ] , Ajuba can also associate with <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> <termsem="GO:0005102"> <termsem="GO:0004872"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> receptor </term> </term> - bound </term> protein-2 ( Grb-2 ) / son of sevenless ( Sos ) , the nucleotide exchange factor for Ras , which is upstream from <termsem="GO:0000187"> activation of <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> </term> [ 9 ] .
Given the increase in pMAPK staining in Tg skin , we examined the possibility that Ajuba might have changed its <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> partner in Snail - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> epidermis .
Interestingly , Ajuba was readily detected in anti-Grb-2 immunoprecipitates of protein lysates from skins of Snail Tg mice but not from the corresponding wild-type ( WT ) animals ( Figure 4E ) .
When these experiments were repeated with -catenin-null epidermis , a similar Grb-2-Ajuba association was detected , and again , this interaction was not detected in the protein extracts from control littermate skin ( Figure 4E ) .
Together , these data demonstrate that the reduction in -catenin levels , either by Snail-mediated <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of E-cadherin or by -catenin conditional targeting , allows Ajuba to interact with Grb-2 / Sos .
If the competition between Grb-2 / Sos and -catenin for Ajuba is functionally relevant to the hyperproliferative state of a keratinocyte , then overexpression of Ajuba would be expected to bypass the competition and <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> activation of the Ras - <termsem="GO:0000165"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> pathway </term> in WT keratinocytes .
Indeed , when serum-starved keratinocytes were transiently <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with an Ajuba <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> vector , the levels of pMAPK were not only elevated but also comparable to those <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with the K14-HASnail transgene ( Figure 4F ) .
This activation was abolished when cells were treated with a small peptide inhibitor that specifically interrupts the Grb-2 / Sos interaction ( Figure 4F ; see lanes marked `` inh '' ) [ 27 ] .
Ajuba 's pre-LIM domain is the segment that associates with Grb-2 's Src-homology 3 domain [ 9 ] .
When this domain was overexpressed in serum-starved keratinocytes , a comparable elevation in pMAPK was observed ( Figure 4F ) .
As expected , the small peptide inhibitor that interrupts the Grb-2 / Sos association blocked the effects .
These data suggested that by elevating cytosolic Ajuba levels , Ajuba 's pre-LIM domain may associate with Grb-2 / Sos in a manner that stimulates its nucleotide exchange activity and leads to activation of the Ras - <termsem="GO:0000165"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> pathway </term> .
Although this pathway provides one mechanism by which Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> may be coupled in skin epithelium , <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> circuitries involving AJs are known to be complex and often interwoven .
Future studies will be needed to systematically dissect these putative intricacies at a molecular level .
Probing the Regulation of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> Gene Expression </term> Reveals an Essential Link to TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> Developing </term> Hair Bud .
The temporal spike of Snail mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the hair bud prompted us to consider what factor ( s ) may be <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> the Snail gene .
A variety of extracellular signals have an impact on the cell type-specific <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of different Snail family members , and many of them , including Wnts , BMPs , FGFs , and TGF-s , also affect hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> [ 2,16,28 ] .
Since Snail is not <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in cultured skin keratinocytes that <termsem="GO:0046903"> secrete </term> active BMPs and FGFs ( see Figure 1B ) , we focused our attention on Wnt and <termsem="GO:0007179"> TGF- signaling </term> as more likely candidates for Snail induction in this cell type .
Previously , we showed that effective transmission of a Wnt-3a signal in cultured keratinocytes can be achieved through their exposure to the BMP inhibitor noggin , which induces LEF-1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> [ 4 ] .
In vitro , these conditions <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> the E-cadherin promoter and induced a LEF-1 / -catenin-sensitive reporter gene , TOPFLASH [ 4 ] .
In contrast , Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> was not induced by these conditions ( Figure 5A ) .
Thus , despite essential roles for Wnts and noggin in hair follicle <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> [ 4,29,30 ] , our studies did not support an essential role for these signals in <termsem="GO:0065007"> governing </term> Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in keratinocytes .
TGF-1 has been shown to induce Snail family members in hepatocytes and heart [ 15 , 31 ] .
In keratinocytes , however , TGF-1 inhibits keratinocyte <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> and seems to be involved in triggering the destructive phase of the cycling hair follicle [ 32 ] .
Of the loss-of-function mutations generated in each of the TGF- genes , only the TGF-2 null state blocked follicle <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> at the hair bud stage [ 32 ] .
Thus , we turned towards addressing whether TGF-2 might be involved in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in keratinocytes isolated from the basal layer of the epidermis .
Though there is no cell culture system available to specifically study placodal cells , these keratinocytes are their progenitors and are the closest approximation available to study the behavior of epithelial cells of the placode .
Interestingly , treatment of cultured keratinocytes with as little as 5 ng/ml of TGF-2 caused a rapid and transient induction of Snail ( Figure 5B ) .
Following this treatment , Snail protein was detected within 30 min , peaked at 2 h , and then declined thereafter .
The induction of Snail appeared to be specific for the active form of the <termsem="GO:0008083"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> factor </term> </term> , as pretreatment of TGF-2 for 10 min at 100 C obliterated the <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> [ Figure 5B , lanes marked ( -- ) ] .
By contrast , although <termsem="GO:0005024"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> TGF- receptor </term> </term> activation remained elevated during the duration of the experiment ( as measured by the sustained <termsem="GO:0016310"> phosphorylation </term> of the downstream effector SMAD2 ) Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> could not be maintained ( Figure 5B ) .
Thus , although Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> correlated with <termsem="GO:0006468"> phosphorylated </term> SMAD2 ( pSMAD2 ) induction , its decline seemed to rely on secondary downstream events .
The rapid kinetics of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> were reflected at the mRNA level , suggesting that Snail promoter activity in keratinocytes might be sensitive to TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> ( Figure 5C ) .
To test this possibility , we <termsem="GO:0009058"> engineered </term> a transgene <termsem="GO:0048518"> driving </term> the <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> reporter under the <termsem="GO:0065007"> control </term> of approximately 2.2 kb of promoter sequence located 5  from the <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> initiation </term> site of the mouse Snail gene .
At 2 d after transient <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> , keratinocytes were treated with TGF-2 ( t = 0 ) and then assayed for transgene activity over the same time course in which we had observed Snail protein induction .
The results of this experiment are presented in Figure 5D .
Within 0.5 h of TGF-2 treatment , Snail promoter activity had increased 3-fold , and by 2 h , it peaked to approximately 10-fold over control levels ( Figure 5D ) .
Thereafter , Snail promoter activity rapidly returned to the basal levels seen in unstimulated keratinocytes .
The kinetics of Snail promoter activity closely paralleled those observed for Snail protein induction .
Moreover , the stimulatory effects appeared to be specific to TGF-2 , since they were abrogated either by heat inactivation of the TGF-2 protein or by mutation of a putative <termsem="GO:0046332"> SMAD binding </term> element located about 1.8 kb 5  from the Snail <termsem="GO:0006352"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> start </term> site ( Figure 5D ) .
Taken together , these results suggested that in keratinocytes , TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> results in a pSMAD2-dependent transient activation of the Snail gene , and that maintenance of Snail protein relies , in part , upon sustained promoter activity .
The brevity of Snail gene and protein induction in TGF-2 treated cultured keratinocytes resembled the temporal appearance of Snail mRNA and protein at the initiation of <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> in embryonic mouse skin .
To test whether TGF-2 might be required for Snail induction in hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> in vivo , we first analyzed whether TGF-2 was <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in or around the hair bud .
Consistent with previous observations [ 33 ] , an anti-TGF-2 antibody labeled <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> hair buds ( Figure 6A ) .
This labeling appeared to be specific as judged by the lack of staining in follicle buds from mice homozygous for a TGF-2 null mutation ( Figure 6A ; [ 34 ] ) .
Moreover , the downstream effector of TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> , pSMAD2 , was also <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in WT , but not TGF-2-null , hair buds ( Figure 6B ) .
Together , these data underscore the importance of the TGF-2 isoform despite <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of both TGF-1 and TGF-2 in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> hair buds at this stage .
To further explore the possible relation between Snail and TGF-2 , we examined the status of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in TGF-2-null hair buds .
As judged by immunohistochemistry , Snail protein was absent from E17 .5 skin of TGF-2-null embryos but not from that of control littermates ( Figure 6C ) .
This effect appeared to be exerted at the <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> level , since Snail mRNAs were also not found in TGF-2 null hair buds under conditions in which the signal was readily detected in the hair buds of littermate skin ( Figure 6D ) .
Conversely , in 2-wk-old K14-Smad2 Tg mice , which display elevated <termsem="GO:0007179"> TGF- signaling </term> in skin [ 35 ] , Snail protein was readily detected by Western blot analyses , where it was not found in postnatal skin ( Figure 6E ) .
Taken together , these results provide compelling evidence that TGF-2 is functionally important for inducing Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in a pSMAD-dependent manner in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> hair buds .
Whether pMARK activity also contributes to Snail induction was not addressed in the present study [ 15 ] .
Although some hair buds still <termsem="GO:0032502"> formed </term> in TGF-2 null skin , their number was reduced by approximately 50 % [ 32 ] .
Thus , although the pathway mediated by TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> impacts the earliest step of epithelial invagination , it does not appear to be essential for bud <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> .
Consistent with this notion , basement membrane <termsem="GO:0048771"> remodeling </term> still took place in the TGF-2-null buds , as judged by immunofluorescence with antibodies against 4 integrin , an integral component of keratinocyte-mediated <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesion </term> to its underlying basement membrane ( Figure 6F ) .
In contrast , TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> appeared to be an important factor for the early <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> that occurs in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> hair buds , as judged by anti-Ki67 and anti-pMAPK immunofluorescence ( Figure 6F and 6G ) .
If TGF-2 stimulates Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> buds , loss of this <termsem="GO:0016015"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> morphogen </term> </term> would be expected to affect the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression of genes </term> that are typically <termsem="GO:0048519"> repressed </term> by Snail .
Since a major target for Snail-mediated <termsem="GO:0048519"> repression </term> is the E-cadherin gene [ 12,13 ] , we investigated the status of E-cadherin in TGF-2-null buds .
As shown in Figure 6H , hair buds in TGF-2 null skin displayed elevated immunofluorescence staining relative to their WT counterparts .
Previously we demonstrated that the concerted action of the extracellular signals Wnt and noggin are required for the generation of a LEF-1 / -catenin <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> complex to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repress </term> E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> at the onset of hair fate <termsem="GO:0007389"> specification </term> .
As shown in Figure 6I and 6J , both WT and TGF-2 null buds exhibited nuclear LEF-1 and -catenin <termsem="GO:0051179"> localization </term> , signs that the Wnt-noggin signaling pathway was intact .
These data suggest that during <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> , TGF-2 functions subsequently to Wnt/noggin-mediated determination of hair fate .
Moreover , through activation of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> , TGF-2 appears to work in tandem with these other <termsem="GO:0016015"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> morphogens </term> </term> to <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulate </term> E-cadherin levels , which contributes to the activation of <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> circuitries .
During budding <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> , intersecting <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling networks </term> from the epithelium and mesenchyme <termsem="GO:0065007"> govern </term> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcriptional </term> , <termsem="GO:0022610"> adhesive </term> , polarity , and <termsem="GO:0006928"> motility </term> programs in these select groups of cells .
The dynamic nuclear and cytosolic changes that take place during this time form the cornerstone for <termsem="GO:0009887"> organ morphogenesis </term> .
Two major challenges in understanding the mechanisms underlying a particular budding process are to order the temporal sequence of external cues involved and then to dissect how the cells of the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> bud translate these signals into the downstream events of cellular remodeling , proliferation , and differentiation .
Our studies here provide some insights into how these events are orchestrated during hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> skin .
<termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> during Early <termsem="GO:0031069"> Hair Follicle Morphogenesis </term> .
Recent studies on hair bud <termsem="GO:0009653"> morphogenesis </term> suggest that Wnt signals likely from the epithelium and BMP inhibitory signals from the underlying mesenchyme converge to <termsem="GO:0022607"> produce </term> an active <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> complex involving -catenin and LEF-1 , which in turn plays a key role in <termsem="GO:0007389"> specifying </term> the hair follicle fate [ 4,29,30,36,37 ] .
Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) and TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> also play essential roles in <termsem="GO:0031069"> follicle morphogenesis </term> , but in contrast to -catenin null skin , in which follicle invaginations are absent [ 30 ] , some hair buds still <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in the absence of LEF-1 , Shh , or TGF-2 [ 32,38 ] .
These likely reflect the first wave of follicle ( i.e. , guard hair ) morphogenesis , which accounts for a small number ( fewer than 5 % ) of hairs and is under distinct <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory control </term> .
Guard hairs <termsem="GO:0032502"> form </term> in the absence of LEF-1 and TGF-2 , and we have found that they also fail to <termsem="GO:0010467"> express </term> Snail at the budding stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> ( unpublished data ) .
How E-cadherin is <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulated </term> in guard hairs remains to be determined .
Several candidates include other Snail family members such as Slug or twist , or alternatively , <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factors </term> </term> involving -catenin and a different member of the LEF-1 / TCF/Sry-type HMG box ( commonly known as SOX ) family [ 39,40 ] .
Further investigation will be required to determine whether the <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling pathway </term> we have elucidated here is a theme with multiple variations .
TGF-s are known to <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> withdrawal of keratinocytes from the <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> [ 41 ] .
Hence , when TGF-2 protein was detected at the transition between the growing and destructive phases of the adult <termsem="GO:0042633"> hair cycle </term> , research initially and naturally focused on a role for this family member in cessation of <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> and/or triggering <termsem="GO:0006915"> apoptosis </term> ( [ 42 ] and references therein ) .
However , in contrast to TGF-1-null skin , which exhibits an extended growing phase of postnatal hair follicles , TGF-2-null skin displays an embryonic block in follicle bud progression [ 32 ] .
Although this phenotype is consistent with TGF-2 's embryonic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> patterns [ 33 ] , about 50 % of TGF-2 null buds appear unable to progress to the down - <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> phase , a feature that can not be explained readily on the basis of previously established effects of TGF-s .
Our finding that TGF-2 is upstream from Ki67 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0000187"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> activation </term> lends further support to the notion that hair follicle keratinocytes at this early stage of <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> <termsem="GO:0050896"> react </term> to TGF-2 <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> in a fashion opposite to that typically expected for TGF- factors .
This said , based upon pSMAD2 immunohistochemistry , the immediate steps of downstream <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> appeared to be intact .
Thus , we surmise that the <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> outcome is likely to be rooted in differences in the repertoire of activated SMAD target genes .
In this regard , the positive effects of TGF-2 on <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> within the hair bud may be more analogous to what has been seen in progression of squamous cell carcinoma to metastatic carcinoma [ 43 ] rather than that typically observed for keratinocytes [ 44,45,46 ] .
The prior identification of the Snail gene as a potential target of <termsem="GO:0007179"> TGF- signaling </term> [ 15 ] was intriguing , given the temporal wave of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> that occurs in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> hair bud .
The additional correlation between epithelial hyperproliferation and Snail transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> further fostered our interest in a possible link between TGF-2 and Snail .
Our functional studies demonstrate that without TGF-2 , Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is abolished in the mutant hair buds , and conversely , in K14-Smad2 skin , Snail is ectopically activated .
Moreover , our in vitro studies indicate that even sustained TGF-2 exposure may cause only a transient induction of Snail , offering a possible explanation as to why Snail is so briefly <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> during <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> .
An additional point worth mentioning is that prolonged <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of Tg Snail in postnatal skin resulted in morphological and biochemical signs of <termsem="GO:0001837"> epithelial to mesenchymal transitions </term> ( unpublished data ) , underscoring why transient Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> may be so important during normal <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> [ 18 ] .
At first glance , the sparsity in hair coat of K14-Snail Tg mice seemed indicative of a defect in follicle <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> ( see Figure 2A ) .
Closer inspection , however , revealed that not all hairs penetrated the hyperthickened Tg epidermis .
Several factors may contribute to the seemingly normal follicle <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> in these mice .
One obvious factor is the K14 promoter , which is elevated in the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath ( ORS ) of the hair follicle , but is markedly <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> in <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> embryonic hair buds as well as in the postnatal hair progenitor cells .
The K14 promoter is also less active in the ORS than epidermis and hence this might also account for the lack of apparent <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> of the ORS to ectopic Snail .
Additional contributing factors could be the multiplicity of Snail family members and their differential <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , the saturation , and/or diversity of <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulatory mechanisms </term> that <termsem="GO:0065007"> govern </term> AJ <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> , <termsem="GO:0016477"> migration </term> , and <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> in the follicle ORS .
Distinguishing between these possibilities must await the <termsem="GO:0000003"> generation </term> of mice harboring skin-specific loss-of-function Snail mutations .
Links between <termsem="GO:0007165"> Signaling </term> , <termsem="GO:0006350"> Transcriptional </term> Cascades , Epithelial <termsem="GO:0048771"> Remodeling </term> , and <termsem="GO:0008283"> Proliferation </term> in the Hair Bud .
Previously , we discovered that early during <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> , E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> is <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulated </term> concomitantly with the invagination of <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> bud cells into the skin [ 4 ] .
Because the timing of this event correlated with the activation of a LEF-1 / -catenin <termsem="GO:0003700"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> factor </term> </term> complex [ 20 ] , we were intrigued by the presence of a putative LEF-1 / TCF <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> site in the E-cadherin promoter .
This prompted an investigation that subsequently led to our discovery that LEF-1 / -catenin can contribute to <termsem="GO:0048519"> repression </term> of E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> in skin keratinocytes [ 4 ] .
In the course of these studies , we also noted that Snail can also contribute to this process in keratinocytes in vitro , and our present studies revealed that Snail is <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> at the right place and time to be physiologically relevant in the process .
In noggin-null embryonic skin , LEF-1 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> and subsequent activation of the LEF-1 / -catenin reporter gene is abrogated in the <termsem="GO:0032502"> developing </term> placodes .
The corresponding failure of E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> underscores the importance of Wnt/noggin signaling in <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulating </term> this event in <termsem="GO:0031069"> follicle morphogenesis </term> [ 4 ] .
Conditional gene targeting studies will be necessary to establish whether Snail family members also contribute to the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> in E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> gene expression </term> that occurs during follicle <termsem="GO:0032502"> formation </term> .
However , it is intriguing that K14-Snail Tg epidermis displayed a marked <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> in E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , thereby demonstrating its potential to do so in skin .
Our prior findings showed that by elevating E-cadherin levels or by conditionally ablating -catenin , <termsem="GO:0031069"> hair follicle morphogenesis </term> can be impaired [ 4,7 ] .
The marked epidermal hyperproliferation seen in the K14-Snail Tg skin , coupled with the converse <termsem="GO:0008285"> suppression of <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> </term> and Snail in TGF-2-null hair buds led us to wonder whether the <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of E-cadherin during <termsem="GO:0031069"> follicle morphogenesis </term> might have a direct impact on elevating the <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> state of these cells .
Our Tg studies suggested that , at least in part through its <termsem="GO:0065007"> regulation </term> of E-cadherin , Snail is able to influence the <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> of a variety of AJ-associated proteins .
One of these appears to be Ajuba , which was previously shown to have the dual capacity to <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> Grb-2 as well as -catenin [ 9,10 ] .
Our studies revealed that in skin keratinocytes that either harbor a conditional null mutation in -catenin or that overexpress Snail , Ajuba develops an interaction with Grb-2 that is otherwise not observed in WT keratinocytes .
The corresponding abilities of either Snail - <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> or Ajuba - <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> keratinocytes to exhibit elevated activation of the Ras - <termsem="GO:0000165"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> pathway </term> suggest that the Grb-2 association of Ajuba under conditions of reduced levels of AJ proteins may be directly relevant to the parallel in hyperproliferation .
In stable epithelial ( i.e. , Madin-Darby canine kidney , or MDCK ) cell lines , Snail has been shown to block <termsem="GO:0007049"> cell cycle </term> progression and <termsem="GO:0048518"> promote </term> <termsem="GO:0006928"> motility </term> and shape changes for invasion [ 47 ] .
While our in vivo studies are consistent with a role for Snail in <termsem="GO:0006928"> motility </term> and epithelial <termsem="GO:0048771"> remodeling </term> , they differ with respect to Snail 's apparent <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferative </term> effects .
A priori , this could be simply due to variations in the <termsem="GO:0050896"> response </term> of different cell types to Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
Alternatively , these differences may be relevant to the benefit of using mouse models to reveal functions not always recapitulated in stable cell line models .
Future studies should highlight the underlying reasons for these opposing results .
Irrespective of these differences , our in vivo studies do not stand alone , as there are many situations in which a <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> in AJ proteins correlate with <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> .
In fact , a myriad of diverse mechanisms have been implicated in activating <termsem="GO:0050673"> epithelial proliferation </term> upon <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulation </term> of AJ proteins [ 7,23,24,48 ] .
Sifting through these converging pathways is likely to be a difficult and painstaking process .
This said , by identifying the status of different players involved in specific cell types and at specific stages in <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> , our mechanistic understanding of how intercellular remodeling is linked to <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferation </term> in <termsem="GO:0002009"> epithelial morphogenesis </term> should begin to surface in the future .
Elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which these networks converge is also a prerequisite for understanding how these processes go awry during tumorigenesis .

It was not seen in later hair germ or peg stages .
( B ) <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> of Snail protein coincides with hair <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .

Misexpression of Snail in Mouse Skin Epidermis Results in Hyperproliferation .
Three different surviving Tg founder mice harbored a K14-Snail transgene that was integrated into a locus that resulted in inheritable , mosaic <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of the transgene in skin epidermis .
All displayed similar abnormalities , as did their offspring .
( A ) P16 WT and K14-Snail Tg mice .
Insets denote magnified tail segments , which displayed a mosaic , flaky appearance in Tg mice .
Size differences appeared with age , and are likely due to K14-promoter activity in the tongue and oral epithelium , resulting in progressive defects and reduced <termsem="GO:0007631"> food intake </term> .
Hence , skin sections from young ( P3 ) mice were analyzed ( B -- I ) .
( B ) Hematoxylin - and eosin-stained Tg skin section .
Double arrows demarcate the border of mosaic histology , with seemingly normal epidermis ( epi ) and a mature hair follicle ( hf ) at left and hyperthickened epidermis at right .
( C ) Immunofluorescence of Tg skin section labeled with antibodies as color-coded on frame .
Double arrows demarcate the border of mosaic anti-Snail ( green ) , revealing Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> coincident with regions of hyperthickened epidermis ( at left ) and absent in regions of normal epidermis ( at right ) .
( D -- I ) Sections of P3 WT or Tg skin ( affected region ) subjected to either immunofluorescence ( D , E , H , and I ) or immunohistochemistry ( F and G ) with antibodies as indicated on the panel .
Anti-keratin 5 indicates K5 , normally restricted to the basal layer of the epidermis ; anti-keratin 6 detects keratin 6 , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in postnatal epidermis under conditions such as wounding , in which hyperproliferation occurs .
All other antibodies are as in the legend to Figure 2 .
Comparison of D and E provide representative examples that illustrate that pMAPK is found in only a subset of all <termsem="GO:0008283"> proliferating </term> ( Ki67-positive ) cells .

Sections were labeled with antibodies as indicated and color-coded on each frame .
Antibodies are against markers of normal epidermal <termsem="GO:0030154"> differentiation </term> , and include K5 ( a basally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> keratin ) , K1 ( a suprabasal keratin , <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in spinous layer cells ) , involucrin ( Inv ; a suprabasally <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> cornified envelope protein found in upper spinous and granular layer cells ) , loricrin ( Lor ; a cornified envelope protein <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> in the granular layer ) , and filaggrin ( Fil ; a protein that bundles keratin filaments in the granular layer and stratum corneum ) .
Note abnormal extension of anti-K5 suprabasally , often present in anti-K1 positive suprabasal Tg cells .
( I -- N ) Immunohistochemistry ( I and J ) or immunofluorescence ( K -- N ) of sections of P30 Wt ( I , K , and M ) and Tg ( J , L , and N ) ( affected areas ) skins using the antibodies indicated .
Note that with age , affected areas of the Tg epidermis became increasingly undulating , often exhibiting papilloma-like invaginations ( J ) .
Insets in I and J are magnified views of the boxed areas , illustrating the absence ( Wt ) or presence ( Tg ) of nuclear anti-cyclin D staining .
With age , affected areas of the Tg epidermis also displayed perturbations within the basement membrane , as judged by antibody labeling against either basement membrane ( K and L ) or hemidesmosomal ( M and N ) components .
Double arrows in L demarcate mosaic zones , revealing that perturbations were restricted to hyperthickened , i.e. , Snail-positive zones ( to left of double arrows ) .
Other abbreviations are as noted in the legend to Figure 2 .
Snail-Mediated Remodeling of AJs Contributes to Hyperproliferation .
( A ) Immunofluorescence of skin sections from P30 Wt and Tg mice .
Shown are affected areas of Tg skin ; in areas where Snail protein was not <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> , stainings were normal .
Antibodies used are against AJ proteins and include E-cadherin ( E-cad ) , the transmembrane core protein ; -catenin ( -cat ) , which <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> E-cadherin at AJs and which can also participate as a <termsem="GO:0003712"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> <termsem="GO:0006350"> transcription </term> cofactor </term> </term> when associated with LEF-1 / TCF proteins in the nucleus ; -catenin ( -cat ) which <termsem="GO:0005488"> binds </term> to both -catenin and Ajuba , a close relative of zyxin ; and Ajuba , which can associate with proteins that <termsem="GO:0005488"> bind </term> to the actin cytoskeleton , as well as with Grb-2 , a mediator of the GTP nucleotide-exchange protein Sos , involved in activation of the Ras - <termsem="GO:0000165"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> signaling cascade </term> .
In Snail - <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> Tg regions , there was a reduced staining with anti-E-cad and anti--cat and a more diffuse staining with anti-Ajuba .
Insets in the panels for -catenin and Ajuba staining are magnified views of the boxed areas .
Arrows mark membrane localization of the protein and asterisks mark cells with elevated levels of cytoplasmic -catenin or Ajuba .
( B ) Western blot analyses of protein extracts from P30 Wt and Tg back and ear skins .
Antibodies are as in ( A ) except anti-P-cad , which detects P-cadherin , whose <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the hair follicle was not affected , and anti-tubulin , which detects tubulin , a control for equal protein loadings .
Note that the reductions seen in E-cadherin and -catenin are likely to be underestimates of the actual differences in affected regions , since the Tg skin <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> Snail mosaically .
( C ) In the presence of elevated Snail , -catenin levels can be restored by overexpression of E-cadherin .
Keratinocytes were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with either HA-tagged Snail ( Snail [ HA ] ; images on the left ) or Snail ( HA ) and Ecad ( HA ) ( images on the right ) .
2 d after <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfection </term> , cells were switched from low-calcium <termsem="GO:0040007"> growth </term> medium to high-calcium medium for 6 h to induce AJ <termsem="GO:0022607"> formation </term> .
Cells were stained with antibodies as indicated on the panels .
Arrowheads point to sites of intercellular contact between a Snail - <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> keratinocyte and its neighboring untransfected cell .
( D ) Reintroduction of E-cadherin in keratinocytes <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressing </term> Snail returns pMAPK to basal levels .
Keratinocytes were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with control vector ( K14 ) , or Snail ( HA ) , or Snail ( HA ) + E-cad ( HA ) .
After 2 d , cells were serum starved for 4 h and whole cell lysates were made and Western blotted with antibodies to pMAPK , HA to recognize the HA-tagged Snail and E-cadherin protein , 20or tubulin as a loading control .
( E ) Ajuba interacts with Grb-2 under conditions where -catenin levels are reduced .
Protein extracts were made from skins of P30 Wt and K14-Snail Tg P30 mice ( blots on the left ) and of newborn Wt and K14-Cre/-catenin ( fl/fl ) conditionally null animals ( blots on the right ) [ 7 ] .
Equal amounts of protein extracts were treated with anti-Grb-2 antibody ( + ) or control isotype antibody ( -- ) , and following centrifugation , immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-Ajuba and anti-Grb-2 antibodies .
Note the presence of Ajuba only under conditions where levels of -catenin and other AJ proteins were aberrantly low or absent .
( F ) Transgene <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of excess Ajuba or the Grb-2-interacting domain ( pre-LIM ) of Ajuba in keratinocytes results in the activation of the Ras - <termsem="GO:0000165"> <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> pathway </term> .
Primary newborn mouse keratinocytes were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with either the empty K14 <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> vector ( K14 ) , or the <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> vector <termsem="GO:0048518"> driving </term> Snail , full length Ajuba , or the pre-LIM domain of Ajuba in the absence or presence of a peptide inhibitor ( inh ) that disrupts the interaction between Grb-2 and Sos .
48 h posttransfection , protein extracts were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with antibodies against pMAPK , total <termsem="GO:0004707"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> MAPK </term> </term> , Ajuba ( also recognizing the smaller , pre-LIM domain ) , and Snail .
TGF-2 , but Not Wnt/noggin , Transiently Induces Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> In Vitro .
( A ) Failure of Wnt and noggin signaling to induce Snail in cultured keratinocytes .
Primary mouse keratinocytes were treated with Wnt - and/or noggin-conditioned medium ( + ) or the corresponding control medium ( -- ) .
These conditions are known to activate the LEF-1 / -catenin reporter TOPGal and <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulate </term> the E-cadherin promoter ( see [ 4 ] for details ) .
Using Western blot analyses , cellular proteins were then analyzed for Snail , LEF-1 , -catenin , and tubulin .
Proteins from keratinocytes <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with K14-Snail were used as a positive control for Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> .
( B ) TGF-2 can induce Snail protein .
Primary keratinocytes were treated for the indicated times with <termsem="GO:0006310"> recombinant </term> TGF-2 ( + ) or heat inactivated TGF-2 ( -- ) .
Total cellular proteins were then isolated and analyzed by Western blot for Snail , pSMAD2 ( reflective of activated TGF - <termsem="GO:0007165"> signaling </term> ) , and tubulin .
Note the activation of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> , peaking at 2 h post-TGF-2 treatment and then disappearing thereafter .
( C ) Snail mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> is transiently induced by TGF-2 .
The experiment in ( B ) was repeated , and this time , total RNAs were isolated from keratinocytes treated with TGF-2 for the indicated times .
<termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> - PCR was then used with ( + ) or without ( -- ) <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> reverse transcriptase </term> </term> ( <termsem="GO:0003964"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> RT </term> </term> ) and with primer sets specific for Snail and <termsem="GO:0008943"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> GAPDH </term> </term> mRNAs .
Note that Snail mRNA <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> also peaked at 2 h , paralleling Snail protein .
( D ) TGF-2 treatment results in <termsem="GO:0048518"> enhanced </term> activity of a Snail promoter - <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> reporter .
Keratinocytes were <termsem="GO:0009294"> transfected </term> with a <termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> reporter <termsem="GO:0048518"> driven </term> by a Snail promoter that is either WT ( wt prom ) or harbors a mutation in a putative pSMAD2/pSMAD4 <termsem="GO:0005488"> binding </term> site ( mt prom ) .
At 2 d posttransfection , cells were treated with either TGF- or heat-inactivated TGF-2 ( inact ) for the times indicated .
<termsem="GO:0004565"> <termsem="independent_continuant"> -galactosidase </term> </term> assays were then conducted , and results are reported as fold increase over a basal level of activity of 1 .
The experiment was repeated three times in triplicate , and error bars reflect variations in the results .
TGF-2 Is Necessary to Induce Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> Expression </term> and <termsem="GO:0065007"> Regulate </term> <termsem="GO:0008283"> Proliferation </term> and E-Cadherin in the Hair Bud .
( A -- D ) Skins from TGF-2 WT or KO E17 .5 embryos were analyzed for <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> of TGF-2 protein ( A ) , which is present in the epidermis and dermis as previously described [ 33 ] and in the hair bud , pSMAD2 ( B ) , Snail ( C ) , and Snail mRNA ( D ) .
Arrows point to the hair buds .
( E ) Western blot analyses of Snail <termsem="GO:0010467"> expression </term> in the skins of 2-wk-old K14-Smad2 transgenic ( SMAD2 TG ) and WT littermate ( WT ) mice .
Antibody to tubulin was used as a control for equal protein loadings .
The K14-Smad2 Tg mouse was previously shown to possess activated <termsem="GO:0007179"> TGF- signaling </term> [ 35 ] .
( F -- G ) <termsem="GO:0008283"> Proliferation </term> markers Ki67 ( F ) and pMAPK ( G ) are diminished in TGF-2-null hair relative to its WT counterpart .
( H -- J ) TGF-2-null hair fails to <termsem="GO:0048519"> down-regulate </term> E-cadherin ( H ) .
Wnt and noggin signaling pathways are still intact in the TGF-2 null hair as nuclear LEF-1 ( I ) and nuclear -catenin ( J ) are still <termsem="GO:0010467"> expressed </term> .

Note Added in Proof .
Our results are particularly interesting in light of the recent implication that GSK-3 <termsem="GO:0065007"> controls </term> Snail 's stability and <termsem="GO:0051641"> subcellular localization </term> [ 50 ] .
Since Wnts are known to deactivate GSK-3 , Wnt and TGF-2 signaling may contribute to Snail 's transient induction and accumulation .
Moreover , since inhibition of GSK-3 results in Snail <termsem="GO:0048518"> upregulation </term> and E-cadherin <termsem="GO:0048519"> downregulation </term> , Snail and GSK-3 may function at a crossroads in <termsem="GO:0065007"> controlling </term> hair bud <termsem="GO:0032502"> development </term> .
