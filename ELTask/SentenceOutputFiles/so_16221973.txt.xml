Two major branches of anti-cadmium defense in the mouse : MTF-1 / metallothioneins and glutathione .
Metal-responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF-1 ) regulates expression of its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in response to various stress conditions , notably heavy metal load , via binding to metal response <termsem="SO:0000001"> elements </term> ( MREs ) in the respective enhancer / <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> .
Furthermore , it serves a vital function in embryonic liver development .
However , targeted <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of Mtf1 in the liver after birth is no longer lethal .
For this study , Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates were both mock - or cadmium-treated and liver-specific transcription was analyzed .
Besides the well-characterized metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , several new MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with MRE motifs in the <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter region </term> emerged .
MTF-1 is required for the basal expression of selenoprotein W , muscle 1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Sepw1 ) that encodes a glutathione-binding and putative antioxidant protein , supporting a role of MTF-1 in the oxidative stress response .
Furthermore , MTF-1 mediates the cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 1 ( Ndrg1 ) , which is induced by several stress conditions and is overexpressed in many cancers .
MTF-1 is also involved in the cadmium response of <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> - and <termsem="SO:0001443"> glycine </term> - rich protein 1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Csrp1 ) , which is implicated in cytoskeletal organization .
In contrast , MTF-1 represses the basal expression of Slc39a10 , a putative zinc transporter .
In a pathway independent of MTF-1 , cadmium also induced the transcription of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in the synthesis and regeneration of glutathione , a cadmium-binding antioxidant .
These data provide strong evidence for two major branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense , one via MTF-1 and its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , notably metallothioneins , the other via glutathione , with an apparent overlap in selenoprotein W. All organisms have evolved mechanisms to cope with a variety of stress situations .
One type of stress response is triggered by heavy metals , such as zinc , copper and cadmium ( for convenience , the terms zinc , copper and cadmium are also used here to denote Zn2 + , Cu2 + and Cd2 + , respectively ) .
Metallothioneins ( MTs ) , small , <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> - rich proteins , play an important role in metal homeostasis and detoxification due to their ability to bind different heavy metal ions ( 1 -- 3 ) .
In the mouse , there are four metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , designated as Mt1 to Mt4 .
Basal , as well as heavy metal-induced , expression of Mt1 and Mt2 is mediated by metal-responsive transcription factor 1 ( MTF-1 ) ( 4 -- 7 ) .
This zinc finger protein recognizes short <termsem="SO:0000727"> cis-acting DNA sequences </term> , termed metal response <termsem="SO:0000001"> elements </term> ( MREs ; core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequence </term> TGCRCNC ) , which are present in the <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoters </term> of target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( 8,9 ) .
MTF-1 is <termsem="SO:0000856"> conserved </term> in evolution , and <termsem="SO:0000853"> homologs </term> have been characterized in the mouse ( 10 ) , humans ( 11 ) , Drosophila ( 12 -- 14 ) and fish ( 15,16 ) .
The role of MTF-1 has been studied most extensively in the mouse .
Besides coping with heavy metal load , MTF-1 can also mediate the induction of Mt <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in response to other stress situations , such as oxidative stress ( 5,17 ) and hypoxia ( 18 ) .
In addition , it is required for the metalloregulation of Znt1 , encoding the major plasma membrane-localized zinc efflux transporter ( 19 ) , the hypoxic/anoxic induction of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> for placental growth factor ( Plgf ) , an angiogenic protein of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) family ( 20 ) , and has recently been invoked in tumor development ( 21,22 ) .
Furthermore , MTF-1 has an essential function during embryogenesis : targeted disruption of Mtf1 results in embryonic lethality around 14 days post coitum due to hepatocyte necrosis ( 23 ) .
In contrast , mice with null <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> for the stress-inducible metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) are viable , though sensitive to cadmium ( 24,25 ) , indicating that additional important MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are involved in the lethal phenotype .
With the Cre - <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> conditional knockout technique , it is possible to circumvent the embryonic lethal phenotype of conventional Mtf1 knockout mice .
Previous experiments with this technique revealed that <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of Mtf1 from the liver after birth is no longer lethal under non-stress conditions ( 26 ) .
For this study , an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout mouse line was generated to perform a search for MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and cadmium-inducible <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the adult liver .
A number of target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> candidates emerged upon a transcriptome analysis of mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and control littermates and several of these were confirmed by semiquantitative RT -- PCR .
Besides the stress-inducible metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were already known as target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of MTF-1 , we find that MTF-1 is important for basal liver expression of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> for selenoprotein W , muscle 1 ( Sepw1 ) as well as for cadmium-induced expression of N-myc downstream regulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 1 ( Ndrg1 ) and the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> encoding <termsem="SO:0001447"> cysteine </term> - and <termsem="SO:0001443"> glycine </term> - rich protein 1 ( Csrp1 ) .
In addition , MTF-1 appears to repress the expression of solute carrier family 39 , member 10 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Slc39a10 ) , which encodes a putative metal ion transporter .
In an MTF-1-independent transcriptome response , several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in glutathione metabolism are induced .
Further studies confirmed a dual anti-cadmium defense , one via glutathione and another one via MTF-1 and its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , including metallothioneins .
Generation of Mtf1 conditional knockout mice and liver-specific <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> .
Mtf1 conditional knockout mice were generated in collaboration with Dr Michael Leviten ( San Carlos , CA ) .
Two <termsem="SO:0000040"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> clones </term> containing <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 to 6 of Mtf1 were used to construct a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> for homologous recombination ( Supplementary Data ) .
A neomycin resistance <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> ( PGK-neo ) <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by two <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> was cloned into the SacI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> 5  of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 3 of Mtf1 , the third <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP site </term> was cloned into the ScaI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> 3  of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 4 .
A thymidine kinase ( TK ) <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> was <termsem="SO:0000046"> inserted </term> in the HpaI <termsem="SO:0000001"> site </term> 3  of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> 6 .
129 ES cells were electroporated with the linearized targeting <termsem="SO:0000440"> vector </term> , selected in the presence of G418 and FIAU , and screened for correct <termsem="SO:0000046"> integration events </term> by PCR and Southern blot analysis .
Transient expression of Cre recombinase led to <termsem="SO:0000045"> removal </term> of the PGK-neo <termsem="SO:0005853"> cassette </term> , and mice carrying the <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> Mtf1loxP <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were generated by injection of positive <termsem="SO:0000151"> clones </term> into C57Bl/6 blastocysts and subsequent crosses .
Homozygous conditional knockout animals ( Mtf1loxP / <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> ) were crossed with the Cre recombinase <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> line Mx-cre ( a gift from Prof. Michel Aguet ) to obtain an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout line .
The mice were genotyped by PCR using the following <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> ( Microsynth ) : Cre recombinase : 5  - CTATCCAGCAACATTTGGGCCAGC-3  ; 5  - CCAGGTTACGGATATAGTTCATGAC-3  , Mtf1loxP or <termsem="SO:0000817"> wild-type </term> <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> : 5  - CACACCCAGTTTGTGTATGTCTTC-3  ; 5  - CAGTCACAAGCAAATTACCAAACACTGCC-3  .
At 8 weeks of age , male Mtf1loxP / <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> mice harboring the Mx-cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( Mtf1loxP / <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> Mx-cre , abbr. : Mtf1Mx-cre ) and control littermates without <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( Mtf1loxP / <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP </term> , abbr. : Mtf1loxP ) received four intraperitoneal injections each of 300 g <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> polyinosinic -- polycytidylic acid [ pI -- pC ; Sigma ; in a volume of 60 l phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ] at 3 day intervals .
Only in the case of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - binding studies with MRE <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> from MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> candidates , the control mice received no pI -- pC injections .
For experiments with metal treatment , mice received 2 days after the last pI -- pC treatment a subcutaneous ( s.c. ) injection of either 20 mol/kg body weight CdSO4 ( 2 mM CdSO4 in H2O ; cadmium treatment ) or 10 ml/kg body weight H2O ( mock treatment ) 6 h before sacrificing them .

Primary embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from a 12.5 day old Mtf1loxP mouse embryo and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( ICN ) , 100 U/ml penicillin -- streptomycin ( Gibco BRL ) and 2 mM l-glutamine ( Gibco BRL ) .
100 mm plates with primary cells were transfected with 10 g of an expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> coding for simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) large T antigen driven by the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> , using lipofectamine  reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Cell foci were isolated and the immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line ckoC was derived from one of them .
The Mtf1loxP <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> of this line as well as the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> <termsem="SO:0000046"> integration </term> of the T antigen were confirmed by PCR .
100 mm plates with these cells were further transfected by the calcium phosphate method ( 30 ) with 19.6 g of an expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> for Cre recombinase driven by the CMV <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> and 0.4 g of an expression <termsem="SO:0000155"> plasmid </term> for the neomycin resistance <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> under the control of the TK <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> .
Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 0.4 g/l G418 ( Calbiochem ) , isolated clones of resistant cells were harvested and grown independently , and the expression of Cre recombinase and <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 and 4 of Mtf1 were analyzed by RT -- PCR .
The cell lines delC19 , delC21 and delC23 with a <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of Mtf1 were chosen for further experiments .
Samples of 1  104 cells/well were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h .
The cells were then pre-incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0 , 5 , 10 , 25 or 50 M l-buthionine - [ S , R ] - sulfoximine ( BSO ) ( Sigma ) , a drug that inhibits glutathione synthesis ( 31 ) .
Later , cells were exposed to 0 , 5 , 10 or 20 M CdCl2 in the specified pre-incubation medium for an additional 24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT ( 3 - [ 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromid ) - based Cell Proliferation Kit I ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
Generation of an inducible , liver-specific Mtf1 knockout mouse line .
Using a homologous recombination strategy , mice were obtained with a <termsem="SO:0000041"> modified </term> Mtf1 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> Mtf1loxP where <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 and 4 , encoding four of the six zinc fingers of the <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - binding <termsem="SO:0000417"> domain </term> , are <termsem="SO:0000357"> flanked </term> by <termsem="SO:0000346"> loxP sites </term> ( Figure 1a ) .
Mice homozygous for the Mtf1loxP <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> were further crossed with animals of the Cre recombinase <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgenic </term> line Mx-cre .
Cre recombinase is expressed in this line under the control of the mouse Mx1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> , which is inducible by administration of interferon alpha or beta , or <termsem="SO:0000351"> synthetic </term> <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> pI -- pC ( 32 ) .
Cre-mediated <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> was reported to be complete in the liver , while varying in other tissues , ranging from 94 % in spleen to 8 % in brain ( 32 ) .
After Cre-mediated <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 and 4 , which results in a <termsem="SO:0000865"> frameshift </term> and premature <termsem="SO:0000319"> translation stop </term> , no functional MTF-1 protein can be produced .
For induction of Cre recombinase , Mtf1 conditional knockout mice harboring the Mx-cre <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) received four intraperitoneal pI -- pC injections at 3 day intervals ( pI -- pC induction ) ; control littermates without <termsem="SO:0000902"> transgene </term> ( Mtf1loxP ) received similar injections .
Using RT -- PCRs ( Figure 1b ) , a shortened <termsem="SO:0000006"> product </term> was obtained with <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> from Mtf1Mx-cre livers , indicating a successful <termsem="SO:0000045"> excision </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in these animals .
On close examination , a very faint band similar in size to full-length signal was also observed in those mice , probably due to a low amount of residual full-length Mtf1 <termsem="SO:0000234"> mRNA </term> .
The level of functional MTF-1 protein was examined by EMSA ( Figure 1c ) : MTF-1 protein -- <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> complex was detectable with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse , but no functional MRE-binding protein was observed with an Mtf1Mx-cre sample .
Thus , <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of <termsem="SO:0000147"> exons </term> 3 and 4 of Mtf1 in the liver of Mtf1Mx-cre mice was virtually complete .
All examined liver-specific knockout mice were viable under laboratory conditions and appeared normal .
MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> search .
For the identification of MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , we compared the liver <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> profiles of mice with and without functional Mtf1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> that had been mock-treated or exposed to cadmium ( n = 3 per <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> and respective treatment ) .
In a first screen , the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> were analyzed with a differential display-based method , called amplification of <termsem="SO:0000758"> <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> cDNA </term> end <termsem="SO:0000412"> restriction fragments </term> ( ADDER ) ( 33 ) .
Thereby an overwhelming number of signals was obtained for the two stress-inducible metallothioneins ( Mt1 and Mt2 ) , due to the abundance of their <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> both in mock-treated and especially in cadmium-treated livers that harbored a functional MTF-1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( data not shown ) .
This result confirmed the importance of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
In a second approach , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression profile in livers of the above mentioned mice was compared by Affymetrix GeneChip  Mouse <termsem="SO:0001026"> Genome </term> 430 2.0 Arrays ( Table 1 ) .
When analyzing the <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> array data of livers from mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice , an at least 2-fold , reliable downregulation of expression was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 13 Affymetrix GeneChip  <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets corresponding to 11 characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Table 1 , a ) .
Seven of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> contain one or more MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequence </term> TGCRCNC within a <termsem="SO:0000001"> segment </term> of 1000 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> upstream of the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> .
For 26 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets corresponding to 24 different characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , a 2-fold or higher , reliable upregulation was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers ( Table 1 , b ) ; 17 of these 24 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> contain MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequences </term> in the upstream <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
The data set for livers of cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice revealed an at least 2-fold , reliable downregulation in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for 21 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets corresponding to 16 different characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Table 1 , c ) ; 10 of these contain MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequences </term> in their upstream <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> .
For 9 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets corresponding to 9 different characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , an at least 2-fold , reliable upregulation was detected ( Table 1 , d ) ; five of them contain MRE motifs .
In addition to characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , <termsem="SO:0000345"> ESTs </term> and RIKEN <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> were also found in the comparison of Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP livers to be differentially expressed ( Supplementary Table 1 ) .
Downregulation of Mt1 and Mt2 was detected in Mtf1Mx-cre livers for both conditions ( though the level of significance for the downregulation of Mt1 in mock-treated animals was above 0.05 ; data not shown ) .
For all MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> characterized so far , such as Mt1 , Mt2 and Znt1 , MTF-1 exerts its transcriptional activation activity via standard MRE <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> located proximal to the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( 4,5,8,18,19 ) .
Even a specific search for MTF-1 <termsem="SO:0000409"> binding sites </term> by selection from a pool of <termsem="SO:0000442"> <termsem="SO:0000985"> double - <termsem="SO:0000001"> stranded </term> </term> oligonucleotides </term> with <termsem="SO:0000449"> random </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> yielded no new binding motif for MTF-1 in addition to the <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> MREs ( 34 ) .
Thus , an MRE <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> is to date the only indication for a direct MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , and four MRE-containing target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> candidates were further analyzed .
Basal expression of Sepw1 depends on MTF-1 .
Sepw1 was found in microarray analysis to be significantly downregulated in livers from cadmium - and mock-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice ( Table 1 , a and c ) .
SEPW1 is a <termsem="SO:0001455"> selenocysteine </term> - containing protein that binds glutathione ( 35 ) and is thought to act as an antioxidant in vivo ( 36 ) .
Sepw1 expression in livers of pI -- pC-induced , mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice was further analyzed by semiquantitative RT -- PCRs and S1 analysis ( Figure 2a and b ) .
In accordance with microarray data a slight , if any , upregulation of Sepw1 transcription was observed in livers from Mtf1loxP mice upon cadmium treatment .
The basal level was reduced in livers from mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice , indicating that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of Sepw1 .
Three MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequences </term> were found in the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> upstream of the mouse Sepw1 <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( Figure 2c ) .
Two of them in opposite orientation overlap almost completely proximal to the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( MRE1 ,  40 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) , the third one is located further upstream ( MRE2 ,  527 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 to Sepw1 MRE1 but not MRE2 <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> was observed in EMSA with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP control mouse ( Figure 2d ) .
As a control , no binding to MRE1 was detected with extract from a pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre mouse , confirming that the bandshift was indeed dependent on the presence of MTF-1 .
Cadmium response of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Ndrg1 was significantly downregulated in microarrays of liver <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> from cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to similarly treated Mtf1loxP control mice ( Table 1 , c ) .
Ndrg1 probably has some role in stress response since various stimuli , including hypoxia and nickel compounds , activate expression of rodent Ndrg1 and/or its human <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> ( 37 -- 40 ) .
The Ndrg1 microarray results were confirmed with semiquantitative RT -- PCRs ( Figure 3a ) : for Mtf1loxP control livers , a clear increase of Ndrg1 expression was observed after cadmium exposure ; in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , this cadmium response was not detectable , while basal expression was similar to controls .
This indicates that cadmium-induced expression of Ndrg1 depends on MTF-1 .
Five MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequences </term> are located upstream of the mouse Ndrg1 <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( Figure 3b ) .
Four of them are <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> ( MRE1 to MRE4 ,  138 to  332 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) , the fifth one is located farther upstream ( MRE5 ,  883 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) .
EMSA was performed to test whether MTF-1 is interacting with some or all of the four proximal MRE <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> ( Figure 3c ) .
Separate <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> were tested for MRE1 and MRE2 , whereas one <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> spanning both <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> was used for MRE3 and MRE4 ( MRE3 ,4 ) .
No complex was seen with MRE1 , but specific MTF-1 complexes were observed for both the MRE2 and MRE3 ,4 <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP mouse .
As expected , no bandshift was observed with protein extract from a mouse lacking MTF-1 ( Mtf1Mx-cre ) .
Cadmium response of Csrp1 depends on MTF-1 .
Csrp1 was found in microarray analyses to be significantly downregulated in cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to Mtf1loxP mice ( Table 1 , c ) .
CSRP1 is a member of the <termsem="SO:0000857"> evolutionary conserved </term> CRP family of proteins that have been implicated in myogenesis and cytoskeletal remodeling ( 41,42 ) .
Semiquantitative RT -- PCRs confirmed the microarray results , namely , that Csrp1 expression is elevated in Mtf1loxP livers upon cadmium exposure ( Figure 4a ) .
In contrast , no cadmium response was detectable in livers from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , suggesting that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction of Csrp1 .
Three MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequences </term> were found upstream of the Csrp1 <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( MRE2 to MRE4 ,  56 to  366 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) , one was found immediately downstream ( MRE1 , +7 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ; Figure 4b ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed with EMSA for MRE2 <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotide </term> and protein extract from an Mtf1loxP liver , but not an Mtf1Mx-cre liver extract lacking MTF-1 , confirming the participation of MTF-1 in the complex ( Figure 4c ) .
MTF-1 inhibits expression of Slc39a10 .
Slc39a10 was detected in microarray analysis to be significantly upregulated in livers from both mock - and cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre mice compared to control animals ( Table 1 , b and d ) .
SLC39 proteins are members of the Zrt - and Irt-like protein ( ZIP ) family of metal ion transporters that transport , with no known exception , metal ion substrates across cellular membranes into the cytoplasm ( 43,44 ) .
In accordance with microarray data , semiquantitative RT -- PCRs showed a downregulation of Slc39a10 expression in livers of Mtf1loxP mice upon cadmium exposure .
In samples from Mtf1Mx-cre mice , the basal expression was significantly increased ; cadmium treatment still resulted in a decrease of Slc39a10 expression ( Figure 5a ) .
It can not be judged by this experiment whether the degree of cadmium-induced reduction of Slc39a10 transcription was identical for Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice or lower in the absence of MTF-1 .
In microarray analysis , the degree of the downregulation was either comparable to the one in control livers or lower , depending on the considered Affymetrix GeneChip  <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> set ( data not shown ) .
The results indicate that MTF-1 is involved in repression of the basal expression of Slc39a10 .
It might also participate in the cadmium response of this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , but it is apparently not exclusively responsible .
One MRE core <termsem="SO:0000994"> <termsem="SO:0000993"> consensus </term> sequence </term> was found just upstream of the mouse Slc39a10 <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( MRE1 ,  21 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ) , another one directly downstream ( MRE2 , +17 <termsem="SO:0000028"> bp </term> ; Figure 5b ) .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed in EMSA analysis for MRE2 with liver protein extract from an Mtf1loxP but not from an Mtf1Mx-cre mouse , while no binding was detected with MRE1 ( Figure 5c ) .
Cadmium-responsive , MTF-1-independent <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Finally , we also identified a number of cadmium-responsive <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were independent of MTF-1 presence , by comparing the <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> array data of all cadmium-treated mice with the data of all mock-treated mice , irrespective of the <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> ( Table 2 ) .
An at least 2-fold , reliable upregulation was observed after cadmium exposure for 31 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets corresponding to 21 different characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Table 2 , a ) .
For 2 <termsem="SO:0000051"> probe </term> sets corresponding to 2 characterized <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , an at least 2-fold downregulation was detected ( Table 2 , b ) .
Several <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in the metabolism of the antioxidant glutathione were found to be upregulated by cadmium exposure , namely the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase ( Gclc ) that is the rate limiting <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> in de novo synthesis of glutathione ( 45 ) ; glutathione reductase 1 ( Gsr ) , the reducing <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> for oxidized glutathione ( 45 ) ; and glutathione-S-transferase , mu 4 ( Gstm4 ) , which is a member of the glutathione-S-transferase supergene family of detoxification <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> ( 45 ) .
In all of these cases , induction was confirmed by semiquantitative RT -- PCRs ( data not shown ) .
Gclc , also referred to as heavy <termsem="SO:0000001"> chain </term> subunit of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase ( Ggcs-hc ) , had been discussed previously as a target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> of MTF-1 ( 6 ) .
Our expression data indicate that Gclc is induced by cadmium but , at least in the adult mouse liver , not dependent on MTF-1 .
To analyze the role of the glutathione system in the cellular cadmium response , mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without functional Mtf1 were treated with cadmium in combination with BSO , a specific inhibitor of glutamate-cysteine ligase ( 31 ) , and cell viability was assessed by a colorimetric assay based on the tetrazolium salt MTT ( Figure 6 ) .
Increasing concentrations of BSO or cadmium alone were to some extent cytotoxic for the examined cell lines .
Treatment with both BSO and cadmium resulted in an enhanced lethality particularly for the cells without functional Mtf1 , indicating that a depletion of glutathione together with a lack of Mtf1 impair an efficient anti-cadmium defense .
Thus , adequate glutathione supply as well as MTF-1 and its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are essential for the survival of the cell under cadmium stress .
Besides <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> related to the glutathione pathway , several other stress-related <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were upregulated upon cadmium exposure , including <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for thioredoxin reductase 1 ( Txnrd1 ) , one of the reducing <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> of the antioxidant thioredoxin ( 46 ) ; KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2 ( Kdelr2 ) participating in ER stress response ( 47 ) ; and the anti-apoptotic Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 ( Bag3 ) involved in stress-induced apoptosis ( 48 ) .
In this study , a virtually complete <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> of Mtf1 in the liver of adult , pI -- pC-induced Mtf1Mx-cre mice did not detectably affect the phenotype of the respective mice under non-stress conditions , confirming that MTF-1 is dispensable in the adult liver ( 26 ) , in contrast to its essential role in embryonic liver development ( 23 ) .
The comparison of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression in livers of mock - or cadmium-treated Mtf1Mx-cre and Mtf1loxP mice revealed several MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> candidates .
<termsem="SO:0000673"> Transcripts </term> of the two stress-responsive metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> Mt1 and Mt2 were severely reduced , in support of a crucial role of MTF-1 for both basal and metal-induced expression of metallothioneins ( 4,6 ) .
One of the newly found target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> is Sepw1 .
The exact molecular function of SEPW1 protein is unknown to date , but a role as antioxidant has been proposed due to its ability to bind glutathione ( 35 ) .
In accordance with this , ectopic expression of mouse Sepw1 renders cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide , and this resistance is dependent on it binding glutathione ( 36 ) .
Furthermore , Amantana et al. ( 49 ) showed that expression of a reporter <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> fused to a rat Sepw1 <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> <termsem="SO:0000731"> fragment </term> can be induced in rat glial cells by copper and zinc , but not cadmium .
This response was dependent on an <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> - <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> MRE sequence located proximal to the rat Sepw1 <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> ( 49 ) , even though initial studies failed to demonstrate MTF-1 binding to that <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> ( 50 ) .
Our expression and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - binding studies strongly suggest that MTF-1 is important for the basal expression of mouse Sepw1 by binding to the corresponding <termsem="SO:0000068"> overlapping </term> - <termsem="SO:0000047"> inverted </term> MRE sequence .
Ndrg1 , another interesting MTF-1 target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> was named N-myc downstream regulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> 1 following the discovery that the transcription factor N-myc represses the expression of mouse Ndrg1 ( 51 ) .
Transcription of Ndrg1 and/or its human <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> is induced by different physiological and cell stress conditions , such as androgens , nickel compounds , <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage and hypoxia ( 37 -- 40,52,53 ) .
In addition , the protein is overexpressed in human cancers of many tissues , such as lung , liver , brain , breast , kidney and skin ( 40 ) .
Although Ndrg1 and especially its human <termsem="SO:0000855"> ortholog </term> have been quite intensely studied , its function remains unclear ; however , the induction by stimuli like nickel and hypoxia suggests an involvement in the cell stress response .
Such a role is strongly endorsed by our finding that Ndrg1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression is also induced by cadmium , and that MTF-1 plays a crucial role in this induction .
In the case of Csrp1 , expression analyses and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> - binding studies indicate that MTF-1 is required for cadmium induction by binding to an MRE upstream of the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> .
Studies with human , avian and chicken CSRP1 have shown that this protein is localized at adhesion plaques and in association with filamentous actin , and interacts with the adhesion plaque protein zyxin , as well as the actin-cross-linking protein alpha-actinin ( 54 -- 57 ) .
The ability to bind these partners suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization ( 58 ) .
Exposure of cultured cells to cadmium causes a decrease in , and destruction of , cellular contact proteins and the actin cytoskeleton ( 59 ) .
In the proximal tubule cells of the rat kidney , a partial loss of actin and the actin-bundling protein villin is observed upon cadmium treatment , as well as the derangement and depolymerization of microtubules ( 60 ) .
Assuming that CSRP1 is important for the organization of cytoskeletal elements in the mouse , its upregulation by cadmium might protect the organism from damage of the cytoskeleton .
Such a mechanism would expand the role of MTF-1 in stress response .
Our expression studies also suggest that MTF-1 represses basal transcription of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as activator for the expression of other target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> like Mt1 , Mt2 , and Znt1 ( 4,19 ) .
SLC39A10 is one of 14 mouse SLC39 members , which belong to the ZIP family of metal ion transporters ( 43,44 ) .
All members of the ZIP family characterized so far increase intracellular cytoplasmic metal ion concentrations by promoting extracellular and vesicular ion transport into the cytoplasm .
ZIP proteins have been reported to be transporters of zinc , iron , manganese and/or cadmium ( 44,61 -- 63 ) .
Although SLC39A10 is largely uncharacterized ( 44 ) , it is referred to in several databases as putative zinc transporter .
It has been previously shown that MTF-1 is important for both basal expression and metal induction of the mouse Znt1 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( 19 ) .
ZnT proteins represent a different family of transporters that reduce intracellular cytoplasmic zinc by promoting zinc efflux from cells or into intracellular vesicles .
Thus , members of the ZnT and ZIP family with zinc as predominant substrate have opposite roles in cellular zinc homeostasis ( 43 ) .
Assuming that SLC39A10 is indeed a zinc transporter , MTF-1 would control expression of two zinc transporters with antagonistic functions , namely , Znt1 and Slc39a10 .
Specific binding of MTF-1 was observed for an MRE located just downstream of the Slc39a10 <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start </term> .
In a simple model , such a binding could interfere with the accessibility of the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcriptional start site </term> for <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> polymerase II and/or general transcription factors , thus preventing transcription initiation of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Indeed , such a mechanism has been described in yeast for the zinc-responsive activator protein 1 ( Zap1 ) and its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> , zinc-regulated transporter 2 ( ZRT2 ) ( 64 ) .
However , the inhibition of Slc39a10 expression by MTF-1 may well be more complex than a competition for <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter </term> binding .
Independent of MTF-1 , cadmium treatment also leads to downregulation of Slc39a10 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcripts </term> , suggesting that some other factor is mediating this response .
A previous target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> search for MTF-1 with mouse embryos of conventional Mtf1 knockout phenotype revealed , besides metallothionein <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , the multifunctional alpha-fetoprotein ( Afp ) and the liver-enriched transcription factor <termsem="SO:0000172"> CCAAT </term> / <termsem="SO:0000165"> enhancer </term> binding protein alpha ( Cebpa ) as prime candidates ( 65 ) .
After an early onset during hepatogenesis , Afp expression is repressed postnatally and replaced by albumin ( 66 ) .
Thus , our adult Mtf1Mx-cre mice lacking MTF-1 were not suitable to analyze Afp expression .
Cebpa is expressed in the adult liver as well as in other tissues ( 67 ) , but the present microarray data revealed no significant expression differences in livers from adult Mtf1loxP and Mtf1Mx-cre mice ( data not shown ) .
Therefore , MTF-1 may affect Cebpa expression only during embryonal development , perhaps in combination with as yet unidentified factors .
The present study confirms and extends the role of MTF-1 as an important stress response regulator .
We have identified and preliminarily characterized four target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> of MTF-1 in the adult mouse liver : in the case of Sepw1 , MTF-1 is required to maintain basal expression , supporting a role of mouse MTF-1 in oxidative stress response .
In addition , MTF-1 contributes to the cadmium-induced expression of Ndrg1 and Csrp1 .
Furthermore , MTF-1 helps to repress the basal expression of Slc39a10 , in contrast to its role as transcriptional activator for <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> like Mt1 , Mt2 or Znt1 .
Thus the same transcription factor apparently serves as an activator or repressor , depending on the target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
The comparison of liver <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression of cadmium - and mock-treated mice also revealed a number of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were responsive to cadmium exposure , independent of the presence or absence of MTF-1 .
Evidence suggests that the production of reactive oxygen species is a major effect of acute cadmium toxicity ( 68,69 ) , and exposure of cultured cells or animals to cadmium is associated with depletion of reduced glutathione , lipid peroxidation and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage ( 70 -- 73 ) .
Oxidative stress and the subsequent restoration of cellular homeostasis have been shown to induce the expression of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding acute-phase proteins and antioxidant <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> ( 74 ) .
In mammals , cadmium tends to accumulate in the kidney and liver as a cadmium-metallothionein complex that has an extremely slow turnover ( 75,76 ) .
Furthermore , metallothioneins provide protection against oxidative stress ( 1,17 ) .
In addition to metallothioneins , glutathione was postulated as a first line of defense against cadmium toxicity ( 77 ) .
Glutathione efficiently complexes cadmium ( 78 ) and scavenges free radicals and other reactive oxygen species directly , and indirectly via <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymatic </term> reactions ( 45 ) .
In such reactions , glutathione is oxidized and has to be regenerated by glutathione reductase .
Also , glutathione-S-transferases mediate the conjugation of various electrophiles to glutathione .
The observed cadmium-induced upregulation of Gclc , Gsr and Gstm4 supports the importance of glutathione in the cellular cadmium response .
The enhanced sensitivity to cadmium toxicity that we found for mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon a combination of Mtf1 <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> and depletion of glutathione further corroborates the importance of MTF-1 and its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> as well as reduced glutathione for an efficient anti-cadmium defense .
Our data provide strong evidence for at least two branches of cellular anti-cadmium defense , one via MTF-1 and its target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , notably metallothioneins , the other via glutathione , with an apparent overlap in Sepw1 .
