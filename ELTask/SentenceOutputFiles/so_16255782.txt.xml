CEBPG transcription factor correlates with antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in normal bronchial epithelial cells but not in individuals with bronchogenic carcinoma .
Cigarette smoking is the primary cause of bronchogenic carcinoma ( BC ) , yet only 10 -- 15 % of heavy smokers develop BC and it is likely that this variation in risk is , in part , <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetically </term> determined .
We previously reported a set of antioxidant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> for which <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance was lower in normal bronchial epithelial cells ( NBEC ) of BC individuals compared to non-BC individuals .
In unpublished studies of the same NBEC samples , <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values for several <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were correlated with these antioxidant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
From these data , we hypothesized that antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are co-regulated by one or more transcription factors and that inter-individual variation in expression and/or function of one or more of these transcription factors is responsible for inter-individual variation in risk for BC .
The putative <termsem="SO:0000235"> transcription factor recognition sites </term> common to six of the antioxidant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> were identified through in silico <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA sequence </term> analysis .
The <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values of these transcription factors ( n = 6 ) and an expanded group of antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( n = 16 ) were measured simultaneously by quantitative PCR in NBEC of 24 non-BC and 25 BC individuals .
CEBPG transcription factor was significantly ( p < 0.01 ) correlated with eight of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in non-BC individuals but not in BC individuals .
In BC individuals the correlation with CEBPG was significantly ( p < 0.01 ) lower than that of non-BC individuals for four of the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , and SOD1 ) and the difference was nearly significant for GPX1 .
The only other transcription factor correlated with any of these five target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in non-BC individuals was E2F1 .
E2F1 was correlated with GSTP1 among non-BC individuals , but in contrast to CEBPG , there was no significant difference in this correlation in non-BC individuals compared to BC individuals .
We conclude that CEBPG is the transcription factor primarily responsible for regulating transcription of key antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in non-BC individuals .
Further , we conclude that the heavy smokers selected for development of BC are those who have sub-optimal regulation of antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by CEBPG .
BC is currently the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States , causing 28 % of all cancer deaths [ 1 ] .
Although cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor , only 10 -- 15 % of heavy smokers ( greater than 20 pack years ) develop BC [ 1-3 ] .
Antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> that provide protection from the effects of cigarette smoke are expressed in the progenitor cells for BC , normal bronchial epithelial cells ( NBEC ) [ 1 ] .
Inherited inter-individual variation in the function of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> plays a role in determining risk for BC [ 4-6 ] .
Antioxidant <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> protect NBEC from reactive oxygen species produced by interaction with and metabolism of xenobiotics such as pollution and cigarette smoke [ 4-7 ] as well as those produced by normal cellular metabolism .
Reactive oxygen species cause many damaging reactions including denaturation of proteins , cross-linking of lipids and proteins and <termsem="SO:0000041"> modification </term> of <termsem="SO:0000348"> nucleic acid </term> <termsem="SO:0001236"> bases </term> , which can lead to cancer [ 7 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> repair the frequent damage to <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> caused by oxidant stress as well as other stresses , including bulky adducts derived from carcinogens in cigarette smoke [ 8 ] .
We previously reported that an interactive <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance index comprising antioxidant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> was lower in NBEC of BC individuals compared to non-BC individuals , suggesting that BC individuals are selected on the basis of poor antioxidant protection [ 9 ] .
In that study , there was a tendency towards correlation in <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance between several pairs of antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in non-BC individuals , but not in BC individuals .
<termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> pairs included in that observation were GSTP1/GPX1 , CAT/GPX3 , and GPX3/SOD1 .
Correlation is one typical characteristic of co-regulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Another is shared <termsem="SO:0000235"> transcription factor recognition sites </term> in the <termsem="SO:0005836"> regulatory regions </term> of those <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> [ 10 ] .
Based on the above findings , it was hypothesized first , that there is inter-individual variation in regulation of key antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by one or more transcription factors and second , that individuals with sub-optimal regulation are selected for development of BC if they smoke cigarettes .
To test these hypotheses , <termsem="SO:0000235"> transcription factor recognition sites </term> common to the <termsem="SO:0005836"> regulatory regions </term> of the above correlated <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> pairs were identified through in silico <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA sequence </term> analysis , and their <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measured simultaneously with an expanded group of ten antioxidant and six <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Brush biopsy samples of normal bronchial epithelium were obtained for research studies at the time of diagnostic bronchoscopy according to previously described methods [ 9,11 ] .
Normal bronchial epithelium in the lung not involved with cancer was brushed prior to biopsy of the suspected cancerous area .
Samples were collected in a manner satisfying all requirements of the Institutional Review Board for the Medical University of Ohio .
Each BC diagnosis and subtype identification was determined by histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology at the Medical University of Ohio .
NBEC samples from a total of 49 individuals , including 24 non-BC individuals and 25 BC individuals , were evaluated in this study .
The biographical characteristics of these individuals are presented in Table 1 .
<termsem="SO:0000673"> Transcript </term> abundance measurement .
Total <termsem="SO:0000356"> RNA </term> samples extracted from NBEC were reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase and <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligo </term> dT <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> as previously described [ 9,11 ] .
Standardized RT ( StaRT ) - PCR was used for <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measurement in these studies .
With StaRT-PCR , an internal standard for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> within a standardized mixture of internal standards ( SMIS ) is included in each PCR reaction .
After amplification , <termsem="SO:0000006"> products </term> were electrophoresed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> Chips with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> 1000 Kit reagents for visualization according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH , Waldbronn , Germany ) .
The StaRT-PCR technology is licensed to <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> Express , Inc. ( Toledo , OH ) .
Many of the reagents are available commercially and were obtained through <termsem="SO:0000704"> Gene </term> Express , Inc. for this study .
StaRT-PCR reagents for each of the measured <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that were not commercially available , including <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> and SMIS , were prepared according to previously described methods [ 11,12 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> information for the <termsem="SO:0000112"> primers </term> is provided in Table 2 .
Including an internal standard within a SMIS in each measurement controls for all known sources of variation during PCR , including inhibitors in samples , and generates virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data that are directly comparable across multiple experiments and institutions [ 13 ] .
The performance characteristics of StaRT-PCR are superior to other forms of commercially available quantitative PCR technology in the areas critical to this study .
With respect to these studies , the key property of a quantitative PCR method is not whether the <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> are measured kinetically or at endpoint , but rather whether there are internal standards in each measurement or not .
The overall performance characteristics of StaRT-PCR , including extensive validation of the method in independent laboratories have been presented in several recent articles and chapters [ 13-15 ] .
With respect to the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> measured in this study , for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> the StaRT-PCR reagents had lower detection threshold of less than 10 molecules , linear dynamic range of more than six orders of magnitude ( less than 10 to over 107 molecules ) , and signal-to-analyte response of 100 % .
In addition , the presence of an internal standard controls for inter-sample variation in presence of PCR inhibitors ( which often are <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - specific ) and ensures no false negatives ( if the PCR fails the internal standard <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> is not observed and there are no data to report ) .
False positives are eliminated through use of a control PCR reaction with no <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> in it .
More than 6,000 <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measurements were conducted in multiple experiments over two years to assess the six transcription factors and sixteen antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in NBEC samples from 49 individuals ( 24 non-BC individuals and 25 BC individuals ) .
Correlation of each of the six transcription factors with each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> was determined by Pearson 's correlation following logarithmic transformation .
The transformation was necessary due to the wide biological variation in expression of each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> among the individuals .
Significance level was defined as p < 0.01 following Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparison , specifically comparison of each of six transcription factors to each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Comparison for significant differences between pairs of correlation coefficients was done by Fisher 's Z-transformation test [ 16 ] .
Analysis of the relationship between virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> with age was assessed by Pearson 's correlation , with gender by t-test , and with smoking history by ANOVA followed by Duncan 's test .
<termsem="SO:0000235"> Transcription factor recognition site </term> analysis .
The El Dorado ( Build 35 ) program from the Genomatix software package was used to locate the correlated <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> within the <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> and define 1101 <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> of the <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoter regions </term> ( 1000 <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> upstream of and 100 <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pairs </term> into the <termsem="SO:0000315"> transcription start site </term> ) for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( Genomatix Software GmbH , Munich , Germany , [ 17 ] ) .
The 1101 <termsem="SO:0000028"> <termsem="SO:0001236"> base </term> pair </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> obtained from the El Dorado program then were used as the target <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> for putative <termsem="SO:0000235"> transcription factor recognition site </term> identification using the MatInspector Version 4.2 program , which yielded sites for 11 transcription factors ( Genomatix Software GmbH , Munich , Germany , [ 17 ] ) .
The parameters used were the standard ( 0.75 ) core similarity and the optimized matrix similarity [ 18 ] .
StaRT-PCR reagents were optimized for ten of these transcription factors , including CEBPB , CEBPE , CEBPG , E2F1 , E2F3 , E2F4 , E2F5 , E2F6 , EVI1 , and PAX5 .
Four transcription factors were expressed at low and invariant levels among multiple NBEC samples and were therefore excluded from the study .
The remaining six , CEBPB , CEBPG , E2F1 , E2F3 , E2F6 , and EVI , were evaluated for correlation with an expanded group of ten antioxidant and six <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data were obtained for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> in each of the 49 samples , except for E2F1 measurement in sample 147 ( Table 3 ) .
A <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - specific inhibitor in sample 147 prevented amplification of E2F1 .
Neither the internal standard , nor the native <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA </term> <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> was observed .
The presence of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - specific PCR inhibition was observable in some other samples as reduction in peak heights in internal standard <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> relative to that expected for the number of internal standard molecules present at the beginning of the PCR reaction .
However , in each such case , the PCR amplification was efficient enough to enable quantification .
In non-BC individuals there was significant ( p < 0.01 ) correlation between CEBPG and eight of the 16 antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , specifically XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , SOD1 , GPX1 , ERCC1 , CAT and ERCC2 ( Table 4 ) .
In contrast , in BC individuals samples CEBPG was not correlated with any of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
These relationships were not observed with any of the other transcription factors studied .
For XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , and SOD1 the correlation with CEBPG was significantly lower in BC individuals compared to non-BC individuals and the difference was nearly significant for GPX1 ( Fig. 1b ) .
Scatter plots of the relationship between CEBPG and XRCC1 in non-BC individuals or BC individuals ( Fig. 2a , b ) are representative of the other four <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Neither CEBPG , nor XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , SOD1 or GPX1 was significantly correlated with age , gender , or smoking history in non-BC individuals , BC individuals , or the combined group .
In non-BC individuals , based on the r2 values from Pearson 's correlation analysis , CEBPG accounts for much of the variance in expression of XRCC1 ( 69 % ) , ERCC5 ( 62 % ) , GSTP1 ( 55 % ) , SOD1 ( 44 % ) , and GPX1 ( 52 % ) .
E2F1 accounts for some of the remaining variance .
For example , when samples from all 49 non-BC individuals and BC individuals were assessed as a single group , E2F1 was significantly correlated with ERCC5 , GSTP1 and SOD1 ( Table 4 ) .
Further , in non-BC individuals , E2F1 was correlated with GSTP1 ( Fig. 1c ) and the correlation was lower in BC individuals .
However , the difference in correlation between non-BC individuals and BC individuals was not significant .
None of the other transcription factors were correlated with XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , SOD1 , or GPX1 ( Fig. 1a , d , e , f ) .
Comparison of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> expression with demographic characteristics .
E2F1 and GSTZ1 each were positively correlated with age .
GSTM1-5 was the only <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> with a difference in expression by gender .
There was a difference in ERCC2 expression between former and never smokers .
In this study , we tested two hypotheses .
First , that there is inter-individual variation in regulation of key antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by one or more transcription factors .
Second , that individuals with sub-optimal regulation are selected for development of BC if they smoke cigarettes .
These hypotheses are supported by the findings that a ) there was large inter-individual variation in <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels of CEBPG and each of the target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and in non-BC individuals , b ) CEBPG <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values were significantly correlated by bivariate analysis with the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values of four key antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in non-BC individuals , and c ) that there was no correlation between CEBPG and these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in BC individuals .
These results support the hypothesis that each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> correlated with CEBPG in non-BC individuals is regulated by CEBPG .
This is supported by the specificity of the CEBPG correlation .
That is , there was lack of correlation between any of the other five transcription factors assessed and these target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
Of particular note is the lack of correlation of the target <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> with CEBPB , which binds to the same <termsem="SO:0000409"> recognition site </term> as CEBPG , and shares its <termsem="SO:0000409"> recognition site </term> within each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
However , there are alternative explanations for the observed correlation of CEBPG with antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in non-BC individuals .
One possibility is that CEBPG and each of the correlated antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> is regulated by a transcription factor that is as yet undiscovered , and/or has a <termsem="SO:0000409"> recognition site </term> that is not yet known and was not in the Genomatix software database .
There also is more than one possible explanation for the observed lack of correlation between CEBPG and antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in BC individuals .
For example , the non-BC individual and BC individual groups are not perfectly matched with respect to age , gender or smoking history ( Table 1 ) and each of these factors could contribute to the observed difference in correlation between groups .
However , the lack of association of <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance level for CEBPG , XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , SOD1 , or GPX1 with age , gender or smoking history argues against such an explanation .
One way to examine this possibility is through additional , larger , more closely matched studies .
Another possible explanation is that any differences in NBEC from BC individuals compared to non-BC individuals resulted from development of BC , instead of being a hereditary cause of increased risk for cancer .
The best way to determine this will be to conduct a prospective study .
In such a study , individuals matched for smoking history will be monitored for development of BC over time .
The correlation of <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values for CEBPG relative to <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values for each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> will be assessed .
It is expected that the greatest incidence of BC will be among the heaviest smokers .
Among the matched heaviest smokers , it is expected that CEBPG will be significantly correlated with each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> among the non-BC individuals but not correlated in BC individuals .
Thus , there are multiple possible explanations for the observed findings .
However , based on the preponderance of data thus far available , we conclude that CEBPG is responsible for optimal transcriptional regulation of key antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in NBEC and that there is inter-individual variation in the regulation of each of these <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by CEBPG .
If this conclusion is correct , the individuals at greatest risk for BC will be those with the most extreme smoking history combined with sub-optimal regulation of the largest number of antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
This , in turn , leads to increased representation among BC individuals of individuals with lack of correlation between CEBPG and each of the affected antioxidant and/or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
CEBPG is a truncated CEBP transcription factor [ 19 ] and possesses the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> necessary for <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> binding and heterodimer formation , but lacks the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> necessary for transactivation [ 20 ] .
CEBPG forms heterodimers with other CEBP family members and in other tissues this leads to increased [ 21 ] or decreased [ 20 ] transcription of the regulated <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
CEBPG is known to have stimulatory effect on the IL-6 and IL-8 <termsem="SO:0000167"> promoters </term> in B cell lines [ 21 ] , and can also act as a dominant negative regulator of CEBPA and CEBPB in fibroblast and B cell lines [ 20 ] .
The data from CEBPG knockout mice support a role for CEBPG in protecting lungs from oxidant damage .
CEBPG - / - knockout mice are healthy at birth but begin to die within 24 hours , and histological examination reveals emphysematous lungs [ 22 ] .
In humans , risk for emphysema is associated with antioxidant capacity [ 23 ] , and there is a strong correlation between risk for emphysema and risk for BC .
However , it will be important to obtain direct experimental evidence in NBECs for the role of CEBPG in regulating the antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> included in this study .
Correlation between CEBPG and target <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> levels may not be associated with correlation at the protein level .
In this study , E2F1 correlation with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair and antioxidant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> was less than the correlation observed with CEBPG , and the E2F1 correlation was observed in both non-BC individuals as well as BC individuals .
The maintained correlation of E2F1 with <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair and antioxidant <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in BC individuals suggests that this function is more tightly controlled in the population and does not play a role in determination of risk for BC .
E2F1 has previously been reported to regulate transcription of <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzyme </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in other cell types , including primary human fibroblasts and mouse epidermal cells [ 24,25 ] .
Clearly this would have survival value since <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> up-regulation in response to E2F1 provides additional <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair when the <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> is replicating and is particularly vulnerable to damage .
Epidemiologic assessment of the correlation between a particular variation in <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA sequence </term> , or <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> , and risk for BC has been a dominant paradigm for many years .
Thus far , these efforts have met with scant success [ 26 ] .
A common limitation in design of such studies is that they involve assessment of a single <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> or occasionally , a few <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> .
Further , although the <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> assessed typically resides within a <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> known to protect bronchial epithelium from carcinogens , oxidants , or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> damage , the selection of the particular <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphism </term> </term> for study is largely empiric , and not based on known functional properties .
These are problems because multiple infrequent <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> at different <termsem="SO:0000001"> sites </term> may all contribute to risk and unless the key <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> can be identified through a functional test , a statistically valid assessment would require much larger study populations [ 27 ] .
The findings of this study support a novel approach to identifying clinically useful biomarkers .
According to the paradigm used in this study , a ) a normal phenotype results from regulated transcription of a group of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> by one or more transcription factors , b ) the corresponding risk-conferring or disease phenotype results from sub-optimal interaction among those same <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , and c ) each phenotype is identifiable and distinguishable through virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance analysis .
The data presented here support the utility of this paradigm in identifying <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> associated with risk for BC .
The next step will be to identify <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> that affect regulation of XRCC1 , ERCC5 , GSTP1 , SOD1 , and GPX1 by CEBPG .
Such <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> should yield biomarkers suitable for more readily accessible samples , such as peripheral blood or buccal smears .
A biomarker combining <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> that affect regulation with those that affect function of antioxidant and <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> is likely to be the most accurate for identifying individuals at risk for BC .
Biomarkers that accurately identify individuals at risk for BC will improve efficacy of chemoprevention and early detection clinical trials .
The observed inter-sample variation in the presence of <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> - specific inhibitors of PCR provides evidence supporting the need for inclusion of an internal standard in each quantitative PCR <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measurement .
Including such internal standards in the form of standardized mixtures of internal standards improves the reproducibility of <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measurement and enables development of a standardized database comprising virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data .
Virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data are highly suited to identification of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that have correlated <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance values .
Correlation at the <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance level is an important <termsem="SO:0000110"> property </term> of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that are co-regulated at the transcription level .
We conclude that in non-BC individuals , CEBPG regulates transcription of key antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in NBEC and that in smokers who develop BC , CEBPG regulation is sub-optimal for a sufficient number of antioxidant and/or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> to cause increased risk .

<termsem="SO:0000001"> Sequence </term> for each <termsem="SO:0000112"> primer </term> used for StaRT-PCR virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measurement or for internal standard preparation ( CT ) [ 15 ] .
Virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data .
Virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data for each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> ( in the form of molecules/106 -actin molecules ) from all experiments were included in the same Standardized Expression Database ( SED ) .
These data are now directly comparable to previously published virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data from this laboratory [ 15 ] , or to Virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data collected by others who use the NCI-funded ( R24 CA 95806 ) Standardized Expression Measurement ( SEM ) Center .
The data presented here represent more than 6,000 Virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance measurements conducted in multiple experiments .
The sixteen antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> and each of the six transcription factors except for E2F1 were measured in each NBEC sample from 49 individuals ( 24 non-BC individuals and 25 BC individuals ) .
1ND , Not detectable ( When 60 molecules of Competitive Template ( CT ) were added to the reaction , CT was detected but native template was not . )
2NA , Not available .
E2F1 was measured in all of the samples except for one BC individual ( 24 non-BC individuals and 24 BC individuals ) .
Bivariate analysis of virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data values for each antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> versus each transcription factor .
The correlation of logarithmically transformed virtually-multiplexed <termsem="SO:0000673"> transcript </term> abundance data ( Table 3 ) from each of the six transcription factors with each of the sixteen antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> was determined .
The transformation was necessary due to the wide range of expression of each <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> among the samples .
The correlation coefficient ( r value ) and level of significance ( p value ) for each correlation are presented .
Significance ( p < 0.01 ) was determined using a two-tailed test following Bonferroni adjustment for six multiple comparisons ( comparison of each of six transcription factors to each of the antioxidant or <termsem="SO:0000352"> DNA </term> repair <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ) .
