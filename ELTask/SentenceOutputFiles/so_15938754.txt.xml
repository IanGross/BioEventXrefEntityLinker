<termsem="SO:0001024"> Haplotypes </term> at the Tas2r locus on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 vary with quinine taste sensitivity in inbred mice .
The detection of bitter-tasting compounds by the gustatory system is thought to alert animals to the presence of potentially toxic food .
Some , if not all , bitter stimuli activate specific taste receptors , the T2Rs , which are expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells on the tongue and palate .
However , there is evidence for both receptor-dependent and - independent transduction mechanisms for a number of bitter stimuli , including quinine hydrochloride ( QHCl ) and denatonium benzoate ( DB ) .
We used brief-access behavioral taste testing of BXD/Ty recombinant inbred ( RI ) mouse strains to map the major <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait locus </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ) for taste sensitivity to QHCl .
This <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> is restricted to a ~ 5 Mb <termsem="SO:0000830"> interval on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> </term> 6 that includes 24 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding T2Rs ( Tas2rs ) .
Tas2rs at this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> display in total 307 <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding region </term> <termsem="SO:0000694"> single <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> polymorphisms </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000694"> SNPs </term> ) between the two BXD/Ty RI parental strains , C57BL/6J ( quinine-sensitive ) and DBA/2J ( quinine insensitive ) ; approximately 50 % of these <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> are silent .
Individual RI lines contain exclusively either C57BL/6J or DBA/2J Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> at this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> , and RI lines containing C57BL/6J Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are more sensitive to QHCl than are lines containing DBA/2J <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> .
Thus , the entire Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> comprises a large <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> that correlates with quinine taster status .
These studies , the first using a taste-salient assay to map the major <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for quinine taste , indicate that a T2R-dependent transduction cascade is responsible for the majority of strain variance in quinine taste sensitivity .
Furthermore , the large number of <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> within <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exons </term> of the Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> , coupled with evidence that inbred strains exhibit largely similar bitter taste phenotypes , suggest that T2R receptors are quite tolerant to variation .
Animals use the gustatory system to provide information about food quality .
For example , sweet-tasting foods may have a high caloric content and are preferred , while bitter-tasting foods often contain toxic substances , and are generally avoided .
Two families of G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) expressed in subpopulations of taste receptor cells ( TRCs ) of the gustatory epithelium have been implicated in the detection and transduction of sweet , bitter and umami ( i.e. , glutamate ) taste : T1Rs for sweet-and umami-tasting stimuli [ 1-8 ] , and T2Rs for bitter-tasting compounds [ 9-11 ] .
The <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that encode T2Rs , the Tas2rs , were first identified by database mining of mammalian <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomes </term> near <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> markers previously linked to differences in bitter taste sensitivity [ 9,11-18 ] .
In mice , the majority of Tas2rs lie within a single <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 .
Thirty-three human Tas2rs ( including 8 <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> ) and thirty-six mouse Tas2rs ( including 3 <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> in C57BL/6J mice ) have been identified [ 9,11,19 ] , and several of these respond to particular bitter stimuli in heterologous expression assays [ 10,20-23 ] , or represent a strong candidate <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> for a specific bitter taste quantitative trait [ 18,24,25 ] .
Several <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait loci </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ) have been identified that influence two-bottle intake of bitter stimuli in the mouse , including <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> for quinine ( Qui ) [ 12,16,26 ] , cyclohexamide ( Cyx ) [ 13 ] and sucrose octaacetate ( Soa ) [ 14,15,17 ] sensitivity .
Each of these <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> map to mouse distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 and are linked to the marker D6Mit13 , which lies within a <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> of 24 intact Tas2rs in the C57BL/6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> ( e.g. , [ 16,27,28 ] ) .
However , the interpretation of these studies remains problematic for two reasons .
First , the density of <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> markers and number of recombinant inbred ( RI ) strains used in these earlier studies did not permit the physical definition of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> intervals </term> containing each <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
Second , these previous attempts to map bitter taste <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTLs </term> relied on behavioral assays that measured consumption , and were thus susceptible to contributions of post-ingestive effects such as toxicity .
As we have shown previously , such effects can confound the quantification of bitter taste behaviors [ 29 ] .
Therefore , the relevance and/or contribution of the aforementioned <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTLs </term> to bitter taste remain unclear .
Furthermore , a number of physiological studies have suggested that the transduction of some amphiphilic bitter compounds , such as quinine and denatonium benzoate , may stimulate taste receptor cells independently of GPCRs ( e.g. [ 30 ] ) .
Quinine may directly activate G proteins , and both quinine and denatonium can block K + channels [ 31-36 ] ; caffeine , another bitter-tasting substance , directly inhibits intracellular phosphodiesterase [ 33 ] .
However , the relative contributions of T2R-dependent and T2R-independent mechanisms to the detection of these bitter stimuli are unknown .
Here we use a taste-salient brief-access lick test [ 29,37 ] to measure taste sensitivities in C57BL/6J ( B6 ) , DBA/2J ( D2 ) and BXD/Ty ( BXD ) recombinant inbred ( RI ) mice to two bitter stimuli , quinine hydrochloride ( QHCl ) and denatonium benzoate ( DB ) .
Using 17 BXD lines that were genotyped at 762 informative <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> markers , we mapped a major <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for QHCl taste to a ~ 5 Mb interval on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 that contains all 24 of the Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the distal <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> .
We analyzed the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> of each Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> in the parental strains ( B6 and D2 ) and 29 RI lines .
This analysis revealed that all 24 <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> are <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphic </term> </term> between the two strains , and that these 24 Tas2rs comprise a single <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> that correlates with QHCl taste sensitivity .
Previous efforts to map <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for bitter taste have utilized consumption tests that may be confounded by the contributions of post-ingestive effects [ 29 ] .
We used a modified brief-access lick test , which minimizes the contribution of such effects [ 29,37 ] to determine whether B6 and D2 mice display differences in taste sensitivity to the taste stimuli QHCl and DB .
After initially screening B6 and D2 mice to determine stimulus concentrations that were aversive but not saturating [ 47 ] , we selected two ligand concentrations for each compound that best differentiated the two strains .
Subsequent taste testing of BXD RI lines was restricted to these two concentrations ( 1 and 3 mM for both QHCl and DB ) .
Avoidance by male and female B6 and D2 mice increased ( as indicated by the decreased lick ratio ) in a concentration-dependent manner for both compounds ( Figure 1A ; Table 1 ) .
There was a significant strain difference for both 1 and 3 mM QHCl ( F [ 1,25 ] > 24.6 ; p < 0.0001 ) .
D2 mice displayed decreased aversion relative to B6 mice at both concentrations .
On the other hand , the strains did not significantly differ in taste sensitivity to DB ( Figure 1A ) .
There were no significant effects of gender .
Mean lick ratios for B6 , D2 and BXD mice .
The number of individual mice tested for each strain ( n ) is listed in the second column .
Subsequent columns show the mean lick rate to water during testing (  SEM ) , mean lick ratio for denatonium benzoate ( DB ) , PROP ( 6-n-propylthiouracil ; PR ) and quinine hydrochloride ( QH ) at each of two concentrations ( see Methods for details ) .
Lick ratios ( mean  SE ) for B6 , D2 and BXD strains .
( A ) Mean lick ratios for B6 ( filled circles ) and D2 ( open circles ) mice at two concentrations of QHCl and DB .
In all panels , a lower mean lick ratio indicates a greater aversion , and therefore greater taste sensitivity , to the stimulus .
For panels B , C , and D , each BXD strain is represented by a different color , and listed in order from least sensitive to most sensitive to 1 mM QHCL .
( B ) Mean lick ratios for the six BXD strains that are most sensitive to QHCl in this assay .
( C ) Mean lick ratios for the five BXD strains that are least sensitive to QHCl in this assay .
( D ) Mean lick ratios for the six BXD strains intermediate in QHCl taste sensitivity to those in ( B ) and ( C ) .
Cutoffs for the three QHCl taster groups were arbitrarily set , as there was a continuity of the phenotype at 1 mM QHCl : sensitive strains exhibited a lick ratio for 1 mM QHCl of  0.3 , intermediate strains from 0.31-0.6 , and insensitive strains > 0.6 .
The absence of two distinct phenotypic classes suggests that sensitivity to QHCL is under polygenic control .
We next tested mice from 17 BXD lines in the same manner .
BXD mice also typically avoided both stimuli in a concentration dependent manner ( Figures 1B -- 1D ; Table 1 ) .
However , QHCl and DB taste sensitivity vary independently across these RI strains : some strains highly sensitive to QHCl are relatively insensitive to DB , and vice versa ( Figures 1B -- 1D ) .
Linkage analysis was conducted using <termsem="SO:0001248"> Map </term> Manager QTX ( version 0.30 [ 38 ] ) .
No significant <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTLs </term> were identified for DB taste sensitivity , although several associations with markers on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomes </term> 2,8 and 12 were `` suggestive '' ( LRS > 9.4 , <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide p = 0.65 ; see Additional File 1 ) .
A significant ( LRS > 20.5 ; <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide p = 0.05 ) <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for sensitivity to 1 mM QHCl was indicated on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 , with a second , suggestive ( LRS > 11.4 ; <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide p = 0.65 ) <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8 ( Figure 2A ) ; at 3 mM QHCl , both of these <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> were suggestive ( LRS > 10.9 ) but did not reach <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide significance ( Figure 2B ) .
A major <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for QHCl taste on mouse <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 .
( Top panel ) The <termsem="SO:0000353"> interval map </term> ( see Methods ) shows a significant <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 ( green ) and a suggestive <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8 ( yellow ) affecting taste responses to 1 mM QHCl .
( Bottom panel ) For 3 mM QHCl , both <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> were suggestive ( yellow ) .
The dashed line indicates <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide significance .
The <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> was linked to a single marker , D6Mit13 ( Table 2 , Figure 3 ) .
Adjacent proximal markers D6Mit254 and D6Mit194 are unlinked to the QHCl <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , as is distal marker D6Mit374 .
Across the 17 RI lines tested there is at least one recombination event between D6Mit13 and either D6Mit254 ( and D6Mit194 , the physical <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> of which is not well defined ) or D6Mit374 .
An additional proximal marker , D6Mit61 , which lies between D6Mit194 and D6Mit13 , was identified from <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotypes </term> of the BXD lines reported by the Jackson Laboratories .
BXD/Ty -34 RI mice display a clear D2 phenotype for QHCl taste ( Figure 1C ) and D2 <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> for D6Mit13 , but have a B6 <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> for D6Mit61 [ 39,40 ] , indicating that D6Mit61 is unlinked to the QHCl <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
Therefore , this <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL interval </term> can be conservatively defined as that portion of mouse <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 that lies between D6Mit254 and D6Mit374 , but is most likely restricted to the <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> between D6Mit61 and D6Mit374 .
Physical mapping of the single linked marker , D6Mit13 , and the two closest unlinked markers , D6Mit61and D6Mit374 , was performed in silico based on the May , 2004 <termsem="SO:0001248"> build </term> of the public B6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
Based on these marker <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> , the size of the QHCl <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> is less than 5.0 Mb ( Figure 3 ) .
This <termsem="SO:0000001"> region </term> contains a number of <termsem="SO:0000906"> known </term> <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , all but eleven of which encode members of two large receptor families : natural killer cell lectin-like receptors , and T2R-type taste receptors .
The Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( which encode the T2Rs ) are found <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> within a 1.2 Mb <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> on either side of D6Mit13 ( Figure 3 , Figure 4 ) .
Because of their proximity to the linked marker , their demonstrated expression in taste receptor cells , and their role in the detection of at least some bitter-tasting compounds , we hypothesized that one or more of the 24 Tas2rs at this <termsem="SO:0000001"> locus </term> were responsible for the major QHCl taste sensitivity <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> .
The QHCl <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> is linked to a single marker on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 .
( A ) As shown in the <termsem="SO:0000353"> interval map </term> for <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 , the trait value ( lick ratio for 1 mM QHCl ) correlates strongly across BXD RI strains with the <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphic </term> </term> marker D6Mit13 ( bold ) .
The dashed line indicates <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide significance .
( B ) The QHCl <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ( which lies between unlinked markers D6Mit61 and D6Mit 374 ) contains a cluster of putative bitter taste receptor genes , the Tas2rs ( gray box ) .

The physical <termsem="SO:0000001"> position </term> of D6Mit194 ( * ) is tentative .
A <termsem="SO:0001248"> map </term> of the distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> .
Twenty-four intact Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> map to distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 ( black ) .
The Tas2rs are found in two <termsem="SO:0005852"> subclusters </term> on either side of the <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphic </term> </term> marker D6Mit13 ( red ) and two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> - rich salivary proteins ( Prp2 and Prh1 ; red ) .
<termsem="SO:0001248"> Map </term> <termsem="SO:0000001"> positions </term> , in Mb , represent <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 positions in the May , 2004 <termsem="SO:0001248"> assembly </term> of the B6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
If one ( or more ) Tas2rs underlie the <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 QHCl taste sensitivity <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> , we would predict that one ( or more ) Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> would exhibit one of three likely characteristics : ( 1 ) A Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> is a <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogene </term> , or is <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> , in D2 ( QHCL-insensitive ) , but not B6 ( QHCl-sensitive ) , mice ; ( 2 ) Missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in the single <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exon </term> of a D2 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> impact protein functions such as ligand binding or receptor coupling to downstream signaling cascades ; ( 3 ) <termsem="SO:0001059"> Mutations </term> in noncoding or <termsem="SO:0005836"> regulatory regions </term> of a D2 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> affects expression of the protein product .
Though we considered all three of these to be valid possibilities , we initially focused on the likelihood that <termsem="SO:0000045"> deletion </term> or <termsem="SO:0000041"> mutation </term> within the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> of a single D2 Tas2r would correlate with the QHCl taste insensitivity phenotype .
Twenty-four intact Tas2rs , along with three apparent Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> , have been identified in the distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> of B6 mice [ 19 ] ( Figure 4 ) .
We designed <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> to non-coding <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> flanking the <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> of each intact Tas2r [ see Additional file 2 ] .
Using these <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligos </term> , we amplified each Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding sequence </term> from D2 <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> .
<termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> were subcloned into cloning <termsem="SO:0000440"> vectors </term> and sequenced .
Comparisons of the <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of B6 and D2 <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> revealed that only two of the twenty-four Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> examined , Tas2r106 and Tas2r124 , were identical across strains at the <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> level ( data not shown ) .
A third , Tas2r120 , could not be amplified from D2 <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> ( Figure 5 ) using either of two pairs of <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> ( Additional file 2 ) , suggesting that this Tas2r is <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> in D2 mice .
Two D2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , Tas2r103 and Tas2r117 , contained numerous missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> and small <termsem="SO:0000159"> deletions </term> that create <termsem="SO:0000865"> frame shifts </term> and premature termination ; these two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> may be <termsem="SO:0000336"> pseudogenes </term> in this strain .
The remaining 19 Tas2rs contained between one and 16 missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> .
All 24 Tas2rs examined have different <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> in B6 and D2 mice , and 307 <termsem="SO:0000694"> single <termsem="SO:0001236"> nucleotide </term> polymorphisms </term> are present within <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exons </term> ( data not shown ) .
Although <termsem="SO:0000694"> polymorphic </term> <termsem="SO:0001236"> <termsem="SO:0001237"> residues </term> </term> between B6 and D2 Tas2rs are found in all <termsem="SO:0000001"> regions </term> of the receptors , 23 % of the <termsem="SO:0001237"> amino acid </term> <termsem="SO:0001059"> changes </term> seen are within the first two extracellular loops of the T2Rs ( data not shown ) .
<termsem="SO:0001023"> Allelic </term> variation across strains for four Tas2rs .
B6 and D2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> of four Tas2rs can be differentiated based on diagnostic restriction digests of amplified <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> ( Tas2r105 , Tas2r116 and Tas2r131 ) or on the presence or absence of a <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> ( Tas2r120 ) .
In each of the 17 BXD strains tested , Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> was always correlated with QHCl taster phenotype ( blue = B6 taster phenotype , red = D2 taster phenotype ) .
See additional file 1 : Table 3 for restriction <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> and <termsem="SO:0000696"> oligonucleotides </term> .
The variability between <termsem="SO:0000858"> orthologous </term> receptors in these two inbred strains suggested that it might be possible to narrow the physical <termsem="SO:0000699"> boundaries </term> of the QHCl taste <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> by determining which Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> are correlated with QHCl taste sensitivity .
Therefore , we proceeded to screen <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> from 29 available BXD RI lines , including the 17 that we had used in taste testing , for the Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> they contained .
In most cases , we were able to identify diagnostic restriction endonuclease digests that would allow us to quickly identify whether a particular Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> was amplified from a B6 or D2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
We did not analyze three <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> ( Tas2r104 , Tas2r114 and Tas2r110 ) where no diagnostic restriction endonuclease could be identified .
For Tas2r120 , which is likely <termsem="SO:0000045"> deleted </term> in D2 mice , the absence of a <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> was diagnostic of the D2 <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> for this <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> .
Surprisingly , we discovered that there have been no apparent recombination events within the distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> during the generation of the BXD RI lines .
For all RI lines tested , every Tas2r within an individual RI line originated from the same parental strain ( Figures 5 , 6 ) .
Furthermore , the <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> of each Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> always correlated with the QHCl taste phenotype ( Figures 6 , 7 ) , suggesting that the entire Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> is a single <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> that varies with QHCl taster status .
The Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> is a single <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> in BXD/Ty RI mice .
The <termsem="SO:0000195"> coding exon </term> of each of 21 Tas2rs in the distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> was amplified <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> from 29 BXD/Ty RI strains .
Each Tas2r within an individual BXD strain originated from the same parental strain ( B6 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> = gray , D2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> = white ) .
The 17 BXD strains that were behaviorally tested in this study are indicated ( * ) .
Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> correlates with QHCl taste phenotype .
Mean lick ratios of B6 , D2 and BXD strains reported in Figure 1 are grouped based on Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> ( B6 <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> = blue , D2 <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> = red ) .
B6 mice ( blue line on left panel ) are more sensitive to 1 mM and 3 mM QHCl than are D2 mice ( red line on left panel ) in brief access taste tests .
Similarly , BXD strains with the B6 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> ( blue lines , right panel ) are more sensitive to QHCl than are BXD strains with the D2 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> ( red lines , right panel ) .
The BXD strains are listed in order from least to most sensitive to 1 mM QHCL .
The gustatory system of mammals is thought to detect thousands of chemically-diverse bitter-tasting substances [ 41 ] .
Although specific receptors , <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> and channels have been implicated in the transduction of bitter stimuli , how interactions of bitter stimuli with taste receptor cells lead to cellular activation and signaling to the central nervous system is still poorly understood .
We have found that a single <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 accounts for most of the variation in QHCL taste sensitivity between B6 and D2 mice .
This <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> maps to the same <termsem="SO:0000830"> <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> position </term> as a previously identified <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for quinine intake , Qui [ 16,28 ] , indicating that taste is the major factor in regulating quinine aversion .
This is an important distinction , as the consumption of bitter-tasting stimuli can be dependent on factors independent of taste , such as toxicity [ 29 ] .
Using 17 RI lines and 762 <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosomal </term> markers , we have restricted the quinine taste <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> to a < 5 Mb region on distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 that contains 24 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> .
At least 60 other <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> also lie within this <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> , including two <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> that encode <termsem="SO:0001439"> proline </term> - rich salivary proteins , Prp2 and Prh1 ; these proteins appear to play no direct role in bitter taste [ 48 ] .
Tas2rs are the most likely candidates for the QHCl quantitative trait <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene ( s ) </term> due to : ( 1 ) their expression in taste receptor cells and ( 2 ) <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> and functional evidence linking them to the detection of a number of bitter taste stimuli .
As of yet there is no evidence for quinine activation of T2Rs from functional assays of these receptors in heterologous cells or membrane preparations , likely due to the lipophilic nature of quinine [ 23 ] .
However , several physiological studies have suggested that quinine can directly activate G proteins or cationic conductances , or can block K + channels in taste receptor cells [ 34-36 ] .
While our data indicates that quinine taste is largely T2R-dependent , it is not exclusively so .
For example , the BXD RI lines exhibited a range of quinine sensitivity , with several strains having similar sensitivities to that of B6 , some strains with sensitivities similar to that of D2 , and a third group with a more intermediate phenotype ( Figures 1 , 7 ) .
This observation is consistent with a polygenic basis for quinine taste [ 16,26 ] .
Also , a suggestive <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8 does not contain any Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> , but does contain a number of <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding ion channels , <termsem="SO:0001185"> enzymes </term> and members of other receptor families ( our unpublished data ) .
It will be interesting to determine whether this suggestive <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> is linked to quinine taste and , if so , whether it is specific for this single bitter stimulus or more broadly related to all bitter taste .
Of the 29 BXD RI lines examined , there was no apparent recombination event within the <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> .
While increasing the number of BXD RI lines or the number of markers used for genotyping them would facilitate the definition of smaller <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL intervals </term> , in this case such an effort is unlikely to permit the identification of one or a few Tas2rs involved in quinine taste .
For example , we examined six lines of AXB and BXA RIs with reported recombinations around D6Mit13 ; a small sampling of the Tas2rs in these RI lines again indicated no recombinations within the Tas2r <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> ( data not shown ) .
Behavioral <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> approaches have been invaluable for identifying <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> involved in taste function , such as the Tas1r3 <termsem="SO:0000704"> gene </term> that encodes a receptor important for sweet and umami taste [ 42 ] .
<termsem="SO:0000001"> Positional </term> cloning also permitted the identification of the Tas2r responsible for the majority of variance of phenylthiocarbamide ( PTC ) taste sensitivity in humans [ 18 ] .
In both of these cases , however , the <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> linked to saccharin or PTC taste were not tightly <termsem="SO:0005851"> clustered </term> with <termsem="SO:0000854"> paralogues </term> .
For bitter taste , behavioral <termsem="SO:0000704"> genetic </term> approaches may be more useful for identifying <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> encoding downstream signaling molecules or components of T2R-independent transduction mechanisms .
For example , a <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for PROP avoidance has been suggested on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 7 [ 16 ] , and we observe a suggestive <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> for quinine taste on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 8 ( Figure 2 ) ; in neither case are Tas2rs found at these <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> ( data not shown ) .
It is somewhat puzzling that 22 of the 24 Tas2rs examined encode <termsem="SO:0001060"> variant </term> proteins in B6 and D2 mice even though these strains exhibit similar taste responses to bitter compounds such as DB or cyclohexamide [ 47 ] .
Taken together , these observations suggest that Tas2rs are quite tolerant of variation , and that perhaps most of the differences observed do not affect <termsem="SO:0000417"> domains </term> important for ligand interactions or receptor-mediated signaling mechanisms .
Interestingly , 23 % of missense <termsem="SO:0001059"> mutations </term> in D2 Tas2rs affect the first two extracellular loops of the receptors .
These two loops have been recently shown to affect the ligand response profiles of some T2Rs [ 23 ] .
More systematic analyses of structure-function relationships between these T2R <termsem="SO:0001060"> variants </term> and an array of bitter stimuli are necessary to determine which <termsem="SO:0001059"> changes </term> may impact ligand binding , interactions with other proteins , or overall receptor structure .
Such large numbers of nonsynonymous <termsem="SO:1000002"> substitutions </term> between <termsem="SO:0000855"> orthologues </term> is suggestive of adaptive selection .
Analysis of <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> diversity of Tas2rs in humans , great apes and old world monkeys suggest that Tas2rs are subject to some degree of positive selection [ 43,44 ] .
However , the fact that these two mouse strains , members of the same species , are so closely related makes this explanation problematic .
It is possible that B6 and D2 mice , which have a similar origin in the early 20th century , inherited different Tas2r <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotypes </term> present in wild mouse populations prior to inbreeding .
Characterization of Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of several wild mouse species or subspecies , or in other inbred lines , would shed light on this issue .
In conclusion , we have found that sensitivity to the bitter-tasting substance quinine , as assayed by a taste specific brief-access test , is a polygenic trait in mice .
However , the major mechanism for quinine taste transduction is likely dependent on one or more T2R receptors .
Most Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000704"> genes </term> in the distal <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> are <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphic </term> </term> across inbred strains of mice , and this <termsem="SO:0005851"> cluster </term> forms a single <termsem="SO:0001024"> haplotype </term> that correlates with quinine taste sensitivity .
The numerous differences in T2R protein <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> between these two mouse strains suggests that T2Rs are broadly tuned receptors quite tolerant to <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequence </term> variation .
This tolerance may help to preserve the ability of T2R-expressing , bitter-sensitive taste cells to respond to a wide array of potentially toxic stimuli .
A total of 188 adult male and female mice were behaviorally tested in these experiments : 16 C57BL/6J ( B6 ; 9 males , 7 females ) , 12 DBA/2J ( 6 females , 6 males ) , and 90 BXD/Ty recombinant inbred mice ( average = 5 / line ; 64 males , 26 females ) from 17 unique lines ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 21 , 24 , 27 , 29 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ) .
All mice were either obtained from Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME ) , or were bred from mating pairs at UTHSC .
At time of testing , mice were individually housed in standard shoebox cages with woodchip bedding and ad libitum food ( Teklad 8640 rodent diet ) .
Taste stimuli used in this experiment were made from reagent-grade chemicals : Sucrose , denatonium benzoate , 6-n-propylthiouracil and quinine hydrochloride ( Sigma Aldrich Corp. ; St. Louis , MO ) .
Concentrations of each solution were made fresh daily using distilled water , and all taste stimuli were presented at room temperature .
All animal protocols were approved by the UTHSC Institutional Animal care and Use Committee .
All behavioral tests were conducted in the commercially available Davis MS-160 gustometer ( DiLog Instruments , Inc. , Tallahassee FL ) .
Testing procedures were similar to those described earlier [ 29,37 ] .
Briefly , after 24 hours of water deprivation , nave mice are given a single 20-minute trial consisting of access to a single bottle of distilled water ( sipper tube training ) .
On day 2 , mice could initiate up to sixteen 5 s trials with a single lick to one of four bottles containing distilled water ( trial training ) .
Testing occurred in sessions 3 and 4 , with one test session per day per mouse .
Trials were 5 s in length with an inter-trial interval of 10 s , and mice had up to 120 s to initiate a trial ; if a trial was not initiated during this interval , the shutter closed for 10 s and the next trial was presented .
Mice were tested with 2 concentrations each of 4 different taste stimuli [ 1 and 3 mM QHCl , 1 and 3 mM DB , 3 and 10 mM PROP ( unpublished data ) , and 0.01 and 0.1 M sucrose ] .
Stimulus trials were presented in 3 blocks of 8 trials , for a total of 24 possible trials per test session .
Each block consisted of each concentration of stimulus plus four presentations of distilled water in random order .
Individual mice were also tested in random order .
The dependent measure for each computed for each mouse was the lick ratio ( average number of licks to stimulusx / average number of licks to water ) where x is a given concentration of stimulus and the average number of licks to water is derived from the water trials during both test sessions .
Lick ratio data for each stimulus were compiled for all individual mice , and means were prepared for each strain .
B6 vs. D2 comparisons ( Fig. 1A ) were made using main effects ANOVA .
Lick ratios for individual mice to sucrose were generally ~ 1.0 ( data not shown ) , indicating that either concentration of this compound was licked at a similar rate to water by these thirsty animals .
This stimulus was intended as a `` neutral '' stimulus , albeit one that has different sensory properties than water , and therefore not analyzed further .
This was done to encourage sampling on `` non-water '' trials , as there is some evidence that mice detect distilled vs. adulterated water in brief-access taste tests based on olfactory clues ; there is no evidence that mice can detect or distinguish among concentrations of a particular stimulus [ 37 ] .
Linkage analysis was conducted on BXD mice using freely available software ( Map Manager QTX [ 38 ] ) , and BXD <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> data shared by Robert W. Williams , University of Tennessee Health Science Center [ 45 ] .
Simple <termsem="SO:0000001"> interval </term> mapping was conducted .
This method evaluates the association between trait values ( lick ratios ) and <termsem="SO:0000732"> expected </term> <termsem="SO:0001027"> genotype </term> of a hypothetical <termsem="SO:0000771"> quantitative trait locus </term> ( <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> ) at multiple analysis points between each pair of adjacent marker <termsem="SO:0000001"> loci </term> .
The significance of each potential association is measured by the likelihood ratio statistic ( LRS ; e.g. [ 46 ] ) .
Permutation analysis ( x2000 ) was used to determine <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> - wide significance criteria for LRS scores .
Significance was set at p < 0.05 and suggestive refers to p < 0.63 .
Additional markers used to refine the <termsem="SO:0000771"> QTL </term> on <termsem="SO:0000340"> chromosome </term> 6 were identified from the Jackson Laboratories online resources for the BXD RI strains [ 40 ] .

<termsem="SO:0000696"> Oligonucleotides </term> were based on published mTas2r B6 or 129/SvJ <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNA sequences </term> or on the public B6 <termsem="SO:0001026"> genome </term> .
Entire <termsem="SO:0000316"> coding regions </term> plus ~ 50 kb of <termsem="SO:0000239"> flanking sequence </term> of each single - <termsem="SO:0000147"> exon </term> Tas2r was amplified from D2 or BXD RI <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME ) by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using a high-fidelity polymerase TaqPro Complete ( Denville Scientific , South Plainfield , NJ ) .
<termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR products </term> were subcloned into pGemT-Easy ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and sequenced at the University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Core .
The <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> of D2 <termsem="SO:0000006"> products </term> were compared to B6 <termsem="SO:0000001"> sequences </term> available in Genbank ( see Additional file 2 ) , and <termsem="SO:0000694"> <termsem="SO:0001025"> polymorphisms </term> </term> identified .
When possible , unique <termsem="SO:0000061"> restriction sites </term> were identified that differentiated B6 and D2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> alleles </term> , and the corresponding restriction endonucleases were used in diagnostic digests of Tas2r <termsem="SO:0000756"> cDNAs </term> amplified from <termsem="SO:0000991"> <termsem="SO:0001026"> genomic </term> DNA </term> of each BXD/Ty RI strain .
For Tas2r120 , the absence of a <termsem="SO:0000006"> PCR product </term> was considered diagnostic of the D2 <termsem="SO:0001023"> allele </term> .
