The human and mouse genes display a high degree of synteny. Mcoln1 shows 91% amino acid and 86% nucleotide identity to MCOLN1.
Annexin A7 is unique in that it carries an extraordinarily long and hydrophobic amino terminus with more than 100 amino acids.
Given the difficulty of studying lethal developmental abnormalities in humans, it is of great potential utility to develop animal models of human birth defects, as the specific genetic abnormalities found in animal models can then be investigated in human populations.
We have demonstrated the presence of both annexin A7 isoforms in red blood cells and the presence of the small isoform in platelets.
To distinguish between the alternatives described above, we deleted an essential coding region in the mouse Capn2 gene in embryonic stems cells and transmitted this mutant allele through the mouse germline.
Olfactory receptors were originally identified in an elegant experiment based on the hypothesis that they would be seven-transmembrane-domain proteins encoded by a large, diverse gene family whose expression is restricted to the olfactory epithelium.
Differences for one gene pair are apparently due to both unequal numbers of expressing cells and unequal transcript levels per expressing cell.
BMPs bind tetrameric complexes of two type I and two type II transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors.
Patients with MLIV do not show mucopolysaccharide excretion, skeletal changes, or organomegaly like the other mucolipidoses.
Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is fundamental to animal development, immune function and cellular homeostasis.
